"At least 13 people are dead and 50 others have been injured after two trains collided in southeast India Sunday, police officials said. A train traveling from Visakhapatnam, in the state of Andhra Pradesh, to Rayagada, in Odisha, had stopped due to a break in an overhead cable when it was hit by an oncoming train, in the Vizianagaram district of Andhra Pradesh, Reuters said, citing a senior railway official. The collision derailed two coaches carrying more than 90 people on the stationary train, the official told Reuters. A preliminary investigation suggests “human error” caused by “overshooting of signal” by the stationary train is what led to the collision, a statement from the country’s railway ministry read. “Out of the 13 people who died, 8 persons have been identified,” M Deepika, superintendent of police for Vizianagaram district, told CNN on Monday. She said railway police would investigate the incident. Sunday’s collision comes just four months after a separate train accident in Odisha, where three trains collided, leaving 275 people dead and more than 1,000 injured. Rescue operations are underway at the accident site, and all of the injured have been moved to hospitals, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on X. The Chief Minister’s Office of Andhra Pradesh said on X it had ordered officials to take quick relief measures to ensure the injured get prompt medical attention and advised nearby districts to send first responders to the scene. The office of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Sunday he had spoken with Vaishnaw about the accident. “Authorities are providing all possible assistance to those affected,” the post on X read. “The Prime Minister extends condolences to the bereaved families and prays that the injured recover soon.” India’s Minister for Railways Ashwini Vaishnaw on Monday announced compensation of $12,000 for those who have lost a family member, $3,000 for those who suffered grievous injuries and $600 for minor injuries.",negative,least people dead others injured two train collided southeast india sunday police official said train traveling visakhapatnam state andhra pradesh rayagada odisha stopped due break overhead cable hit oncoming train vizianagaram district andhra pradesh reuters said citing senior railway official collision derailed two coach carrying people stationary train official told reuters preliminary investigation suggests human error caused overshooting signal stationary train led collision statement country railway ministry read people died person identified deepika superintendent police vizianagaram district told cnn monday said railway police would investigate incident sunday collision come four month separate train accident odisha three train collided leaving people dead injured rescue operation underway accident site injured moved hospital railway minister ashwini vaishnaw said x chief minister office andhra pradesh said x ordered official take quick relief measure ensure injured get prompt medical attention advised nearby district send first responder scene office indian prime minister narendra modi said sunday spoken vaishnaw accident authority providing possible assistance affected post x read prime minister extends condolence bereaved family prays injured recover soon india minister railway ashwini vaishnaw monday announced compensation lost family member suffered grievous injury minor injury
"One of India’s most revered entrepreneurs believes that young people need to put in exceptionally long hours at work if they want to see the country become a global economic powerhouse. N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of the software behemoth Infosys, said India needs “highly determined, extremely disciplined and extremely hardworking” youngsters, who should put in 70 hours a week at work. “You know, this is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War,” Murthy told Mohandas Pai, the former CFO of Infosys, in a chat published on YouTube Thursday. Murthy, whose wealth is estimated at over $4 billion by Forbes, co-founded Infosys in 1981. It went on to become one of the world’s biggest outsourcing firms. He is also the father-in-law of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. “Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not so desirable habits from the West and then not helping the country,” Murthy said. “India’s work productivity is one of the lowest in the world.” He added that Indians should learn from policies that helped other emerging markets, particularly China. The tech tycoon said that corporate leaders in India should motivate young people to “work very hard” by telling them that “for the first time India has received certain respect (globally). This is the time for us to consolidate and accelerate the progress.” India, one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, is projected to expand 6.3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Murthy’s comments on putting in longer hours professionally come at a time when there has been a drastic shift in the way people think about work in the West and in China. For a few years now, many young people in China have embraced a new philosophy they’ve called “lying flat,” to fight against the country’s “996” excessive work culture‚ or the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week. In the United States, quiet quitting became a workplace trend last year, in which people decided to stop doing work that is beyond what they were hired to do. Murthy’s comments were slammed on social media. Over the past few years, several surveys have shown that Indians feel they are among the most overworked and underpaid people in the world. CNN has reached out to Infosys for comment.",neutral,one india revered entrepreneur belief young people need put exceptionally long hour work want see country become global economic powerhouse nr narayana murthy cofounder software behemoth infosys said india need highly determined extremely disciplined extremely hardworking youngster put hour week work know exactly german japanese second world war murthy told mohandas pai former cfo infosys chat published youtube thursday murthy whose wealth estimated billion forbes cofounded infosys went become one world biggest outsourcing firm also fatherinlaw british prime minister rishi sunak somehow youth habit taking desirable habit west helping country murthy said india work productivity one lowest world added indian learn policy helped emerging market particularly china tech tycoon said corporate leader india motivate young people work hard telling first time india received certain respect globally time u consolidate accelerate progress india one fastest growing major economy world projected expand year according international monetary fund murthys comment putting longer hour professionally come time drastic shift way people think work west china year many young people china embraced new philosophy theyve called lying flat fight country excessive work culture practice working pm six day week united state quiet quitting became workplace trend last year people decided stop work beyond hired murthys comment slammed social medium past year several survey shown indian feel among overworked underpaid people world cnn reached infosys comment
"India’s economy is like an elephant. The world’s most populous nation is hard to get moving, but a force to reckon with once in action, analysts often say. While the global economy has lurched from one crisis to another in recent times, India has shed its lumbering gait and broken into a steady trot. It began the year by strutting its stuff at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Emissaries from India had such a dominant presence at the main street in Davos that one investor described the thoroughfare as “Little India.” A few months later, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ summit in New Delhi, a first for India, the country’s stock market zoomed to dizzying heights. The growing economic confidence isn’t limited to earth. In August, India joined the tiny club of countries that have safely placed a spacecraft on the moon, underscoring its scientific and technological ambitions. The euphoria around India comes at a time when China, which has been the engine of global growth for decades, is seeing a major economic slowdown. Its southern neighbor is fast emerging as a potential successor. From a surging young population to humming factories, the country has a lot going in its favor. “The Indian economy is undeniably poised for greatness, with a number of reforms undertaken in past years finally paving the way for solid growth,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, adding that “the country is receiving considerable interest from foreign investors for at least some good reasons.” New Delhi also has warmer relations with the West, which views China with growing suspicion, and that means investors now consider the world’s largest democracy a bright spot in an increasingly fractured world. In the past few decades, there have been other periods of global bullishness about India, but the excitement kept fizzling out, while China raced ahead. The gap between the two Asians economies is massive. India’s economy is currently worth nearly $3.5 trillion, making it the world’s fifth largest. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is bigger by almost $15 trillion. The two combined are expected to contribute about half of global growth this year, the International Monetary Fund has said, with 35% of that coming from China. To overtake China as the biggest contributor to global growth in the next five years, India must achieve a sustained growth rate of 8%, Barclays analysts wrote in an October report. The IMF projects that India will expand at 6.3% this year. China, on the other hand, has set an official growth target of around 5%, as it grapples with mounting challenges, ranging from weak consumer spending to a deepening property crisis. “India’s economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years,” Barclays said. But to achieve the “historically-aspirational” 8% pace of growth, the private sector in India needs to “step up its level of investment,” it added. The Modi government, which aims to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, is certainly laying the groundwork to make it easier to do business and attract more companies to invest. Much like China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. In this year’s budget alone, $120 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion. The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added 50,000 km (about 31,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 50% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2022. The Modi government has said the daily pace of national highway construction has more than doubled since it first came to power nine years ago. India, which has some of the world’s biggest software companies, has also built a range of digital platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed commerce. “Digitization has been a game changer for the country’s citizens and businesses,” said Prasad. “Formalization of the economy has reduced many frictions to doing business and given India’s citizens a sense of being vested in the country’s economic success.” For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has changed lives for millions of Indians by providing them with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database now covers most of India’s 1.4 billion people and has helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives. Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy. In September, Modi, citing a World Bank report, said that thanks to its digital public infrastructure, “India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just 6 years which would otherwise have taken at least 47 long years.” Indian companies are getting in on the act. Some of the country’s biggest conglomerates, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Gautam Adani’s eponymous group, are spending billions on 5G and clean energy, even though they built their empires on the back of traditional industries such as fossil fuels. India is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington. Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices. As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India. But even as India’s heft is increasing, it is far from recreating the economic miracle China unleashed decades ago. “India is not like China in the late 1990s and early 2000s in that the government is not clearing obstacles to FDI [foreign direct investments] as quickly,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School. “I think the perception is different compared to China in the early 2000s — just more bureaucratic, more unpredictability around non-tariff barriers and things that get in the way.” That unpredictability was on full display in 2016 when Modi suddenly banned most of India’s cash, resulting in long-term pains for citizens and businesses. And, while the country is taking many steps to woo foreign companies, its authorities have cracked down on firms from China. In an October report by HSBC, economists Frederic Neumann and Justin Feng wrote: “India at the moment runs on too few cylinders to take up the slack from China’s sputtering growth engine,” before going on to highlight the differences in consumption and investment in the two economies. China accounts for around 30% of the world investment, while India’s is less than 5%. “Even assuming zero growth in China, and a tripling of investment spending growth in India from its recent average, it would take another 18 years before India’s investment spending catches up to China’s,” they wrote. And it would take another 15 years for India’s consumption to catch up to where China is today in terms of total spending, according to the report. “Now, none of this is to say that India is not going to have an impact. It will, no doubt — though it won’t be enough to shield the world economy should China’s economy stumble badly,” they added.",positive,india economy like elephant world populous nation hard get moving

"Just a few pieces of debris stood between Munna Qureshi and dozens of laborers who his team had been tasked with rescuing from deep inside a Himalayan tunnel after all previous attempts to free them had failed. “I could hear the laborers gasping on the other side with excitement,” the 29-year-old said. “My heart was racing as I removed the last rock between us.” Qureshi is among 12 specialized workers who were called by Indian authorities to help with last month’s rescue of 41 construction workers trapped in the collapsed tunnel in northern Uttarakhand state. For nearly three weeks the construction workers were cut off from the world, some 60 meters inside the mountain, receiving food and air through a thin tube and frequent updates from rescuers outside. Engineers worked round the clock to drill a safe passage through the broken rock using a state of the art machine, while officials flew in experts to help with rescue efforts. But ultimately, after 17 days, it was Qureshi and his colleagues who succeeded in bringing the men to safety after the drill broke beyond repair just meters from the trapped workers. Known locally as “rat hole miners”, they belong to a niche group of highly skilled, but poorly paid excavators who typically crawl through narrow tunnels to extract coal from deep within the ground. It is a profession so dangerous it has been banned in some parts of the country. But it has been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks, and the men celebrated as heroes by many across the country. “Rat hole mining may be illegal,” Lt General Syed Ata Hasnain, a retired official from India’s National Disaster Management Authority told reporters shortly after the rescue. “But a rat miner’s talent and experience is not.” Workers employed in the dangerous profession are among the most vulnerable and marginalized in India, hence the unflattering local moniker. Mostly migrants from some of India’s poorest states, they are paid about $5 for a day’s work, according to local reports. Slimly built and nimble, they are expected to enter tiny crevices in mines, often deprived of oxygen and at risk of being buried under loose soil. Most coal mining in India takes place in northeastern Meghalaya state, home to some of the country’s largest coal deposits, amounting to more than 576 million metric tons. Rat hole mining was banned in the state by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2014 due to health and environmental risks, but it’s still carried out illegally in secluded pockets of the region. According to Hasina Kharbhih, the founder of Impulse, a non-profit that advocates for the safety of these workers, an estimated 225 “rat hole miners” died between 2007 and 2014, before the practice was banned. In 2018, four years after the ban was implemented, another 15 died after becoming trapped in an illegal coal mine for two weeks. “This number however is the tip of the iceberg,” Kharbhih said. “I am sure if other regions where this happened were thoroughly researched, these numbers would go up.” Most of the men called to rescue the laborers said they knew the risks when they joined the profession. “I always thought this job would take my life someday,” one of the workers, Nasir Khan, said. “I never thought it would earn me respect.” However, justice B.P. Katoki, a retired judge who was appointed by the tribunal to implement the ban on rat mining, said the country shouldn’t “normalize” such a dangerous profession. “It was a last effort to rescue the lives of 41 people, so an argument can be made that it was necessary,” he told CNN. “But that does not mean one celebrates the practice. That has dangerous implications.” Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami announced 50,000 rupees ($600) will be handed out among the workers as a token of appreciation. But some of the “rat miners” said they are still waiting for details of the compensation. And despite the media attention, they said they had not been thanked or rewarded by the authorities. Just two hours after the men were rescued, a list of 90 men who took part in the effort was circulated by an Uttarakhand government official on a media WhatsApp group. Conspicuously missing were the names of the 12 “rat miners” who put their lives on the line to complete that final breakthrough. “This does not surprise me,” said Mohammad Irshad Ansari, one of the “rat miner” workers. “A laborer is and will only be seen as a laborer. Whatever we may have done, it does not change that we are poor.” CNN has contacted the Uttarakhand government for comment about the compensation. One of the men, Monu Kumar, said he received a hero’s welcome when he arrived home in northern Uttar Pradesh state. “There was music playing, we were garlanded, and my family and neighbours distributed 30 kilograms worth of sweets to everyone,” he said. “People (in the village) are saying that we did so much, put our life on the line, but we did not get anything in return.” To get to the trapped workers, the “rat miners” had to crawl through an 80-centimeter (2.6 feet) diameter pipe inserted into the debris, crouch for hours in the small space and dig through the final 12 meters (about 40 feet) of rubble with their bare hands. Khan said it was “unlike anything we have ever seen before.” “It was not just debris, stone, or a mountain; there were steel pipes, water, and ropes in there. We used many tools to slowly get them out,” he added. Two “rat miners” went in at a time on rotating four-hour shifts, with one cutting the stone and the other pulling the debris out of the pipe. “It was difficult. It was risky,” said Kumar. “There is no doubt about that.” Ansari wants to keep going to rescue more men should the situation arise, but Khan’s family has urged him to quit his job, saying the risk is not worth the low pay. Despite working for three decades in the industry, he cannot afford to send his three children to school. “This work is also seasonal. We do not have it in summer months as access to oxygen is a problem, and in monsoons as the water makes it unsafe,” he said. “By working for only four months in a year, how can I afford to send my children to school? I did not go to school and nor will they.” Kumar feels the media attention won’t last long. “Soon, these calls will stop coming,” he said. “No one is going to remember us.”",negative,piece debris stood munna qureshi dozen laborer team tasked rescuing deep inside himalayan tunnel previous attempt free failed could hear laborer gasping side excitement yearold said heart racing removed last rock u qureshi among specialized worker called indian authority help last month rescue construction worker trapped collapsed tunnel northern uttarakhand state nearly three week construction worker cut world meter inside mountain receiving food air thin tube frequent update rescuer outside engineer worked round clock drill safe passage broken rock using state art machine official flew expert help rescue effort ultimately day qureshi colleague succeeded bringing men safety drill broke beyond repair meter trapped worker known locally rat hole miner belong niche group highly skilled poorly paid excavator typically crawl narrow tunnel extract coal deep within ground profession dangerous banned part country thrust spotlight recent week men celebrated hero many across country rat hole mining may illegal lt general syed ata hasnain retired official india national disaster management authority told reporter shortly rescue rat miner talent experience worker employed dangerous profession among vulnerable marginalized india hence unflattering local moniker mostly migrant india poorest state paid day work according local report slimly built nimble expected enter tiny crevice mine often deprived oxygen risk buried loose soil coal mining india take place northeastern meghalaya state home country largest coal deposit amounting million metric ton rat hole mining banned state national green tribunal ngt due health environmental risk still carried illegally secluded pocket region according hasina kharbhih founder impulse nonprofit advocate safety worker estimated rat hole miner died practice banned four year ban implemented another died becoming trapped illegal coal mine two week number however tip iceberg kharbhih said sure region happened thoroughly researched number would go men called rescue laborer said knew risk joined profession always thought job would take life someday one worker nasir khan said never thought would earn respect however justice bp katoki retired judge appointed tribunal implement ban rat mining said country shouldnt normalize dangerous profession last effort rescue life people argument made necessary told cnn mean one celebrates practice dangerous implication uttarakhand chief minister pushkar singh dhami announced rupee handed among worker token appreciation rat miner said still waiting detail compensation despite medium attention said thanked rewarded authority two hour men rescued list men took part effort circulated uttarakhand government official medium whatsapp group conspicuously missing name rat miner put life line complete final breakthrough surprise said mohammad irshad ansari one rat miner worker laborer seen laborer whatever may done change poor cnn contacted uttarakhand government comment compensation one men monu kumar said received hero welcome arrived home northern uttar pradesh state music playing garlanded family neighbour distributed kilogram worth sweet everyone said people village saying much put life line get anything return get trapped worker rat miner crawl centimeter foot diameter pipe inserted debris crouch hour small space dig final meter foot rubble bare hand khan said unlike anything ever seen debris stone mountain steel pipe water rope used many tool slowly get added two rat miner went time rotating fourhour shift one cutting stone pulling debris pipe difficult risky said kumar doubt ansari want keep going rescue men situation arise khan family urged quit job saying risk worth low pay despite working three decade industry afford send three child school work also seasonal summer month access oxygen problem monsoon water make unsafe said working four month year afford send child school go school kumar feel medium attention wont last long soon call stop coming said one going remember u
"Over half a century ago, India’s then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi talked about the staggering challenge for developing nations: to industrialize without harming the environment. “On the one hand the rich look askance at our continuing poverty — on the other, they warn us against their own methods,” she told a United Nations event in Stockholm in 1972, the first global conference to make the environment a major issue. “We do not wish to impoverish the environment any further and yet we cannot for a moment forget the grim poverty of large numbers of people,” she added. Her words have never been more relevant. The tension between economic growth and environmental protection is at the heart of global discussions about how to tackle the ever accelerating climate crisis. Addressing the opening session of the COP28 climate talks in Dubai on Friday, India’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, said all developing countries must be given “a fair share in the global carbon budget” — the amount of planet-warming carbon pollution the world can emit and still avoid climate catastrophe. Even though Earth is now heating up to dangerous levels, many governments around the world persist with viewing coal, oil and gas as sources of economic development, energy security and geopolitical power, the UN said this year. As a result, the world’s fossil fuel production in 2030 is set to be more than twice the amount needed to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the goal of the Paris climate agreement, a recent UN Environment Programme report found. One of the major contributors to that disastrous overshoot will be India, which is burning ever greater amounts of coal and oil as it tries to meet the needs of its 1.4 billion people. It plans to double domestic coal production by 2030. But even as the world’s most populous nation clings to coal with one hand, there are some signs that it is attempting to chart a more sustainable course with the other. India has made “significant investments and set ambitious targets for renewable energy,” the UNEP report said, noting that the world’s fastest growing major economy has earmarked over $4 billion toward energy transition in this year’s national budget. Other global agencies have also noted India’s growing ambitions in the pursuit of green energy. The Paris-based International Energy Agency said in a report in October that the country was “moving into a dynamic new phase in its energy development marked by a long-term net zero emissions ambition.” In 2021, Modi pledged India would achieve net zero emissions by 2070, which is still a couple of decades later than developed economies. Transforming India’s energy sector, like most things in the country, is going to be chaotic and muddled, but it will have far-reaching implications for the global energy market and the race to limit global warming. “India’s net zero by 2070 target, if met in full and on time along with all respective national targets, will take the world to 1.7 degree Celsius global average surface temperature rise by 2100,” said Siddharth Singh, energy investment analyst at the IEA. Getting there need not come at the cost of growth. Already there are “early signs of a gradually loosening link between economic development and carbon emissions,” said Singh. If the country is able to meet its pledges, its carbon emissions will fall by over 40% by 2050, even as its GDP quadruples over this period, IEA said in its report. India is the world’s third-largest energy consuming country, although its energy use and emissions per person are less than half the world average, IEA data shows. That could change rapidly. Thanks to rising incomes, energy demand has doubled since 2000, with 80% of demand still being met by coal, oil and solid biomass. Over the next three decades, the South Asian nation will see the largest energy demand growth of any country in the world, the IEA said. That superlative isn’t surprising as the country is expected to achieve some impressive economic milestones. The world’s fifth largest economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, analysts say, and may become only the third country with annual GDP of $10 trillion by 2035. And as it develops and modernizes, its urban population is going to shoot up, leading to a massive rise in the construction of homes, offices, shops and other buildings. “India adds the equivalent of a London to its urban population every year for the next 30 years,” said Singh. The Modi government is also trying to boost domestic manufacturing and that has unleashed a building boom, with everything from roads and bridges to ports and railways springing up around the country. This infrastructure bonanza will lead to a surge in demand for coal and steel, which are huge sources of carbon emissions. Electricity demand is also expected to skyrocket in the coming years because of factors ranging from improved standards of living to climate change. The latter has been fueling deadly heatwaves across India, and as a result, air conditioner ownership is set to see a sharp spike in the coming years. By 2050, India’s total electricity demand from residential air conditioners is set to exceed the total energy consumption in the whole of Africa today, the IEA said this year. Coal accounts for almost 70% of the country’s electricity generation and is not likely to change in the near future. The future role of fossil fuels is one of the most controversial issues nations are grappling with at COP28. While some are pushing for a “phase-out,” others are calling for the weaker language of a “phase-down.” India has said that the former option is not feasible at the moment. “We cannot phase out fossil fuels unless we have nuclear or until [energy] storage becomes viable,” India’s power minister R.K. Singh said last week, just days after he had said that the country won’t be rushed into reducing its use of coal. “We are not going to do this … we are not going to compromise on availability of power for our growth, even if it requires that we add coal-based capacity,” the minister said in November. Still, the fact that India is developing at this point in history gives it a unique opportunity not to repeat the climate sins of wealthier nations. The country was a reluctant signatory to the Paris climate accord in 2015, when more than 190 countries pledged to limit the precipitous rise in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with a preferred goal of 1.5 degrees. Those pledges haven’t yet been delivered. The world is careening toward nearly 3 degrees of global warming, even if current climate policies are met, the United Nations has warned. The Modi government has set ambitious goals. It has promised that renewable energy will fulfil 50% of India’s energy requirements by the end of this decade. The government also set a target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel electricity generating capacity by that period — up from about 173 GW last year. India has launched an incentive program to boost domestic manufacturing in critical sectors including solar modules and advanced chemistry cell batteries. If the program works, it could see India establish itself as a “reliable exporter” of solar modules, the IEA said in its 2023 report. “The country already has the world’s fourth largest combined capacity for wind and solar PV electricity generation, and will be the third largest by next year,” Singh said. “In the context of its development journey, India’s clean energy targets are indeed impressive.” If Asia’s third largest economy is able to meet its pledges, it would also offer a new roadmap to growth, one that allows developing countries to get rich and go green at the same time. Major conglomerates are keen to seize the green opportunity. India’s richest men, including Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, are investing billions into clean energy, even though they made their empire on the backs of fossil fuels. “There has probably never been a better time than now for India to grow more sustainably,” said Tim Buckley director of Sydney-based think tank Climate Energy Finance. That’s because of two main reasons: the world is seeing unprecedented levels of investment in clean technologies following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and solar energy is getting significantly cheaper, he explained. But there is still a big funding gap. The IEA has said that energy investments need to nearly triple by the end of this decade for India to be on a trajectory to meet its zero emission targets. The Modi government wants rich nations to do more when it comes to climate financing. The developed world agreed more than a decade ago to transfer at least $100 billion a year to developing countries to help both with their green transitions and efforts to adapt to the climate crisis. That pledge was reaffirmed in the 2015 Paris Agreement, but the target has never been met. In his speech to COP on Friday, Modi warned that “thinking only about one’s self interest will only lead the world into darkness.” Hopefully, that message will be heard by India’s vast bureaucracy as

"India’s top court on Monday upheld the government’s controversial 2019 decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, also ruling that the disputed Muslim-majority territory should regain its state designation with local elections to be held next year. In the Supreme Court judgment, Chief Justice DY Chandrachud said the “restoration of statehood shall take place at the earliest and as soon as possible,” as he directed the country’s Election Commission to hold polls in Jammu and Kashmir by the end of September 2024. Claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan, the mountainous Kashmir region has been at the epicenter of an often-violent territorial struggle between the nuclear-armed neighbors for more than 70 years. The region is one of the world’s most dangerous flashpoints, and a de facto border called the Line of Control divides the areas overseen by New Delhi and Islamabad. Four years ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) scrapped Article 370, a constitutional provision that granted special status to the former state, including the power to have its own constitution, flag and autonomy over all matters, save for certain policy areas such as foreign affairs and defense. Just days later, India’s parliament voted to split Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories, a highly contentious move that gave New Delhi greater control over the disputed region. Meanwhile, the remote mountainous region of Ladakh, previously a part of Jammu and Kashmir, was turned into a standalone territory. Parts of the disputed region are claimed by both India and China. The reclassification of Ladakh was also upheld, the Supreme Court said Monday. Revoking Kashmir’s special status was one of Modi’s key promises during his 2019 general election campaign and the Supreme Court verdict comes just months before he is expected to run again for a rare third term. Modi on Monday hailed the court’s verdict as a “resounding declaration of hope, progress and unity.” “Today’s Supreme Court verdict on the abrogation of Article 370 is historic and constitutionally upholds the decision taken by the Parliament of India on 5th August 2019,” Modi wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The verdict was “a beacon of hope, a promise of a brighter future and a testament to our collective resolve to build a stronger, more united India,” he added. The scrapping of Article 370 brought Jammu and Kashmir under all the provisions of the Indian constitution. The move allowed non-residents to buy property in the valley and apply for jobs or scholarships that had previously been reserved for the state’s existing population. The move also prompted uproar from opposition parties at the time, with critics saying the changes to Kashmir’s status could further inflame tensions and the risk of violence in an already unstable region. On Monday, some Kashmiri politicians expressed their disappointment at the court’s verdict. “The people of J&K are not going to lose hope or give up. Our fight for honour and dignity will continue regardless,” wrote Mehbooba Mufti, former chief minister and current leader of the Jammu and Kashmir People’s Democratic Party. “This isn’t the end of the road for us.” Omar Abdullah, vice president of the Jammu Kashmir National Conference, said he was “disappointed but not disheartened.” “The struggle will continue. It took the BJP decades to reach here. We are also prepared for the long haul,” he wrote on X.",neutral,india top court monday upheld government controversial decision revoke special status jammu kashmir also ruling disputed muslimmajority territory regain state designation local election held next year supreme court judgment chief justice dy chandrachud said restoration statehood shall take place earliest soon possible directed country election commission hold poll jammu kashmir end september claimed entirety india pakistan mountainous kashmir region epicenter oftenviolent territorial struggle nucleararmed neighbor year region one world dangerous flashpoint de facto border called line control divide area overseen new delhi islamabad four year ago prime minister narendra modis ruling bharatiya janata party bjp scrapped article constitutional provision granted special status former state including power constitution flag autonomy matter save certain policy area foreign affair defense day later india parliament voted split jammu kashmir two union territory highly contentious move gave new delhi greater control disputed region meanwhile remote mountainous region ladakh previously part jammu kashmir turned standalone territory part disputed region claimed india china reclassification ladakh also upheld supreme court said monday revoking kashmir special status one modis key promise general election campaign supreme court verdict come month expected run rare third term modi monday hailed court verdict resounding declaration hope progress unity today supreme court verdict abrogation article historic constitutionally upholds decision taken parliament india th august modi wrote x formerly twitter verdict beacon hope promise brighter future testament collective resolve build stronger united india added scrapping article brought jammu kashmir provision indian constitution move allowed nonresident buy property valley apply job scholarship previously reserved state existing population move also prompted uproar opposition party time critic saying change kashmir status could inflame tension risk violence already unstable region monday kashmiri politician expressed disappointment court verdict people jk going lose hope give fight honour dignity continue regardless wrote mehbooba mufti former chief minister current leader jammu kashmir people democratic party isnt end road u omar abdullah vice president jammu kashmir national conference said disappointed disheartened struggle continue took bjp decade reach also prepared long haul wrote x
"FBI director Christopher Wray is in India this week for a trip aimed at strengthening security cooperation and deepening a partnership. But it comes in the wake of a major law enforcement issue between the two nations – one far more sinister and with the potential to cause cracks within that alliance. Just two weeks ago, the United States accused an Indian government official of being involved in a conspiracy to kill an American citizen on its home soil. The citizen in question is Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist, who was allegedly the target of a murder-for-hire plot in New York City. Pannun is a wanted man in India – considered by the government there as a terrorist and national security threat. But to some Sikhs overseas, Pannun is an outspoken activist and a man rallying for a cause that has come to unite large swaths of the community’s international diaspora. Late last month, US federal prosecutors charged an Indian national on suspicion of trying to kill him, according to an explosive indictment, which alleged the hitman was acting upon orders from an unnamed Indian government official. The stunning revelation came little more than a month after Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly alleged that India may have been involved in the murder of another Sikh separatist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, on its soil, prompting a furious response from New Delhi and provoking a diplomatic fallout between the two countries. India has vehemently denied involvement in Nijjar’s murder. The US plot was foiled and the details in the indictment have yet to be heard in court. But the episode has cast “a dark shadow on New Delhi’s credibility,” wrote Suhasini Haider, the diplomatic affairs editor at The Hindu newspaper, in one of her recent editorials. And it has many asking: How badly had this hit New Delhi’s ties with Washington? India’s government has denied any involvement in the alleged plot to kill Pannun. But in contrast to the vocal condemnation it made after Canada’s accusation, it has set up a high-level committee to investigate the accusations in the US indictment. “As regards the case against an individual that has been filed in a US court, allegedly linking him to an Indian official, this is a matter of concern,” India’s foreign ministry said after the indictment was revealed. The cause Pannun has been campaigning for is the creation of a separate Sikh homeland – one that would be known as Khalistan and include the state of Punjab in India. Khalistan has long been outlawed in the world’s largest democracy, where painful memories of a deadly insurgency by some Sikh separatists continue to haunt many Indian citizens. But it garners a level of sympathy among some in the Sikh diaspora overseas, where protected by free speech laws, people like Pannun are able to openly advocate for secession from India. The topic is highly charged. Four decades ago India’s former prime minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards after she sent army troops charging inside the religion’s holiest shrine to flush out separatists that had been harboring inside. That operation, known as Blue Star, destroyed much of the building and left hundreds dead. Riots broke out in the days after Gandhi’s murder, killing some 3,000 people – predominantly Sikhs – according to official figures, in one of the worst outbreaks of communal violence since India’s partition. In the years since, those pursuing the Khalistan cause have formed a minority in Punjab given the government’s banning of the movement – and linked extremism doesn’t pose a significant threat to the country, analysts say. But seeking reconciliation for what they view as human rights abuses committed against their community, several overseas Sikh organizations continue to advocate for Punjab secession and say the Khalistan movement is being falsely equated with terrorism by the Indian government. Despite this, the government’s response to campaigners overseas remains robust, particularly under current Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “India went through a very difficult phase with the Khalistan movement in 1980s. It defined their national security,” said Harsh Pant, vice-president of the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank. “Therefore, the Indian state tends to take a very serious view of these things.” Pannun, the Sikh separatist wanted by the Indian government, was a close associate of Nijjar, who was also wanted by India for terrorism related offenses. A fiery orator Pannun has repeatedly made comments that are perceived as secessionist and threatening toward India and its government. He is wanted on more than a dozen terrorism charges in India and accused of trying to radlicalize his community in support of the creation of Khalistan – an independent Sikh homeland that would include parts of India. India has outlawed the US-based secessionist group, Sikhs for Justice, headed by Pannun, which holds referendums among diaspora groups in support of Khalistan. In a widely circulated video last month, he warned Sikhs not to fly Air India on November 19, citing “danger” to their lives. Headlines reverberated across India in the days that followed claiming Pannun was threatening to “blow up” the aircraft. Pannun told CNN he was “not surprised” by the indictment outlining the foiled plot to kill him. “The government of India has officially declared a reward on (my) head for running the global Khalistan Referendum campaign,” he said, referring to votes the Sikh diaspora around the world have held on gathering support for a separate homeland. Asked by CNN if we was a threat to India, as New Delhi claims, he replied: “While my advocacy surely challenges India’s territorial integrity… this challenge is through ballots and not bullets, hence the challenge I pose is not considered terrorism under UN and international laws.” On his remarks about Air India, he said comments in the Indian media were often misrepresented. “My video message is to ‘boycott’ Air India not ‘bomb’,” he said. “This is a disinformation tactic of India’s Modi government to equate a non-violent call of ‘boycott’ with terrorism.” Analysts say Pannun’s inflammatory rhetoric – and the media hype that surrounds him in India – could provoke backlash from citizens and prompt a government response. “When you have someone making these statements regularly and Indian media broadcasting them, it takes the conversation beyond the confines of diplomacy,” Pant said. “Many Indians might ask why the US government is tolerating such behavior. The public perception of the danger may be much higher than the danger itself.” To some, the Indian government’s alleged pursuit of an American citizen on its home soil might appear risky and put a dent in relations between two countries that have recently rapidly strengthened economic, technological and defense ties. However, analysts say the chances of a major fallout are low as both are committed to countering the rise of a neighboring superpower that they view as a joint concern – China. “The common wisdom is that the US and India need each other for vital strategic purposes: above all, to mount an effective front in competition with China,” said Daniel S. Markey, senior adviser, South Asia, for the United States Institute of Peace. “Therefore, they will manage this issue without being sidetracked from that mission. And, to date, the two sides have avoided acrimonious public statements, pledging to take the matter seriously.” And there is recent past precedent for this kind of pragmatic realpolitik. The murder in Saudi Arabia’s Istanbul consulate of Jamal Khashoggi, a US resident and Washington Post columnist critical of the Saudi government, caused global outrage and US condemnation at the time. But ultimately the vital relationship between Washington and Riyadh has been stabilized. In a statement on Monday announcing Wray’s visit, India’s Central Bureau of Investigation – the equivalent to the FBI – said their meeting signified “a step towards deepening cooperation and shared commitment to combat crime in all its manifestations in the spirit of international police cooperation”. The statement did not mention the US indictment. The measured US-India response, to some, might suggest India’s top-most officials weren’t privy to the alleged plot. “I find it very difficult to accept the logic that it goes all the way to the top,” said Pant. “Primarily, because I think the costs are too high… And if you assume that this is a rogue element, then I think the question is who lost control?” The US indictment alleged that Nikhil Gupta, 52, worked with an unnamed Indian official to set up a meeting with an undercover officer he believed to be a hitman to target Pannun. The Indian official agreed to pay $100,000 to the undercover officer for the arranged murder, according to prosecutors. But the hitman contacted by Gupta was in fact an undercover officer from the Drug Enforcement Agency, according to the DEA. Gupta was arrested in June of this year in the Czech Republic where he is pursuant to a bilateral extradition treaty. In India at least, the incident has done little to damage the government’s reputation. “Some hard-liners may actually take pride in this episode as a demonstration of Indian muscle and believe it is a necessary deterrent against other overseas critics of the Indian state,” said Markey from USIP. Pant said while there might be “fringe” support for the alleged attempt on Pannun’s life, the government “understands the complexities” of the case. “That’s why you’ve seen that very swiftly, there has been a response to America and a committee has been constituted (to investigate),” he added. “Because I think the implications are quite serious.” However, if the alleged ties to the Indian government are proven, Markey said, the country’s professional intelligence officers will “pay a reputational cost.” “India’s diplomats, especially in Washington and Ottawa, will be left to clean up that mess,” he said.",negative,fbi director christopher wray india week trip aimed strengthening security cooperation deepening partnership come wake major law enforcement issue two nation one far

"An act of vandalism at an 18th century monument built by the once powerful Mughal empire has sparked anger in India, with historians urging authorities to provide better protection for the country’s vast cultural heritage. The destruction of parts of three emperors’ tombs at the Zafar Mahal palace in New Delhi was discovered by historians Sunday during a heritage walk at the site, which is overseen by a government agency responsible for conserving historic monuments. “It is believed that this is the last great Mughal monument,” said historian Sam Dalrymple, who alerted a security guard to the damage. “Zafar Mahal has been slowly falling apart for years and is symbolic of the wider neglect of Mughal history in Delhi.” The vandalism includes damage to part of a marble lattice screen, or jaali, that surrounds the empty grave of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the final Mughal emperor, who was exiled in 1858 to Burma – now Myanmar – by India’s former British rulers. The destruction was “really heartbreaking,” said artist Srishti Rana Menon. “It’s one of the most hauntingly beautiful place (sic) and those jaalis were nothing short of exquisite,” she wrote on Instagram. “What’s lost is really priceless.” “Absolutely shocked, hurt and angry at whatever took place,” wrote another user. “Considering myself lucky to witness these before the vandalism.” The palace, which is free to enter for the public, is among more than 170 heritage sites in Delhi that are protected by the government-run Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Praveen Singh, superintending archaeologist from ASI Delhi Circle, said there was “nothing huge” in the vandalism at Zafar Mahal. “No doubt it is damaged. But the whole monument has not vanished,” he told CNN, adding that a complaint had been lodged with police in Delhi’s southern Mehrauli district. No arrests have been made and authorities will investigate the case, a Mehrauli police official said. Delhi, a metropolis of more than 20 million people, has seen rapid urbanization over the past few decades, with a vast, sparkling modern metro system, and a burgeoning middle class that has come to symbolize India’s economic growth. But between its meandering roads stand centuries-old monuments and medieval ruins that put the Indian capital on a par with the world’s great ancient cities, historians say. “It is one of the rare cities on the scale of heritage of Rome and Cairo,” said Dalrymple, who grew up in Delhi. “The sheer extent of history is remarkable.” He also questioned how vandals were able to cause damage at a monument in the capital. “One of the greatest tragedies is that this is happening in Delhi. What’s happening outside?” he said. Even before the vandalism, Zafar Mahal had fallen into disrepair, with weeds growing around the tombs and dirt on the walls and other structures, according to amateur historian Shah Umair. “The ASI have been promising for years they will renovate the palace, but there have been no steps taken so far,” said Umair, who discovered the damage alongside Dalrymple. Singh, from ASI, said the agency had been expected to start repairs at Zafar Mahal in April, but the work had been delayed as cost estimates had not been set. “We do regular preservation and conservation of all monuments as and when required,” Singh said. The Mughal empire, which ruled India from 1526 and 1858, reached its pinnacle under emperor Shah Jahan, who commissioned the iconic Taj Mahal in Agra as a mausoleum for his wife and built a wealth of other artistic marvels across the country. And the destroyed jaali at Zafar Mahal is considered an archetype of the Indo-Islamic art movement that flourished during Mughal rule. In recent years, however, the rise of Hindu nationalism in India has put some Mughal-era monuments at the center of controversy. For example, anger erupted in 2017 after the UNESCO-listed Taj Mahal was excluded from an official government tourism brochure. Former Tourism Minister Alphons Kannanthanam dismissed the controversy at the time, stating the Taj Mahal was “India’s pride.” For many, however, the controversy showed creeping intent by the ruling Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party to exclude India’s former Muslim rulers from its cultural history. Historian Rana Safvi said some of the Mughal architecture found in south Delhi’s Mehrauli district was unique to India and called on authorities to do more to protect it. “This very typical Indo-Islamic art, you don’t see anywhere but in this region,” said Safvi, referring to well-known motifs like marble jaalis and floral symbols. Safvi also urged authorities to do more to protect lesser known, but equally significant monuments. “We should take pride in our history",negative,act vandalism th century monument built powerful mughal empire sparked anger india historian urging authority provide better protection country vast cultural heritage destruction part three emperor tomb zafar mahal palace new delhi discovered historian sunday heritage walk site overseen government agency responsible conserving historic monument believed last great mughal monument said historian sam dalrymple alerted security guard damage zafar mahal slowly falling apart year symbolic wider neglect mughal history delhi vandalism includes damage part marble lattice screen jaali surround empty grave bahadur shah zafar final mughal emperor exiled burma myanmar india former british ruler destruction really heartbreaking said artist srishti rana menon one hauntingly beautiful place sic jaalis nothing short exquisite wrote instagram whats lost really priceless absolutely shocked hurt angry whatever took place wrote another user considering lucky witness vandalism palace free enter public among heritage site delhi protected governmentrun archaeological survey india asi praveen singh superintending archaeologist asi delhi circle said nothing huge vandalism zafar mahal doubt damaged whole monument vanished told cnn adding complaint lodged police delhi southern mehrauli district arrest made authority investigate case mehrauli police official said delhi metropolis million people seen rapid urbanization past decade vast sparkling modern metro system burgeoning middle class come symbolize india economic growth meandering road stand centuriesold monument medieval ruin put indian capital par world great ancient city historian say one rare city scale heritage rome cairo said dalrymple grew delhi sheer extent history remarkable also questioned vandal able cause damage monument capital one greatest tragedy happening delhi whats happening outside said even vandalism zafar mahal fallen disrepair weed growing around tomb dirt wall structure according amateur historian shah umair asi promising year renovate palace step taken far said umair discovered damage alongside dalrymple singh asi said agency expected start repair zafar mahal april work delayed cost estimate set regular preservation conservation monument required singh said mughal empire ruled india reached pinnacle emperor shah jahan commissioned iconic taj mahal agra mausoleum wife built wealth artistic marvel across country destroyed jaali zafar mahal considered archetype indoislamic art movement flourished mughal rule recent year however rise hindu nationalism india put mughalera monument center controversy example anger erupted unescolisted taj mahal excluded official government tourism brochure former tourism minister alphons kannanthanam dismissed controversy time stating taj mahal india pride many however controversy showed creeping intent ruling hindunationalist bharatiya janata party exclude india former muslim ruler cultural history historian rana safvi said mughal architecture found south delhi mehrauli district unique india called authority protect typical indoislamic art dont see anywhere region said safvi referring wellknown motif like marble jaalis floral symbol safvi also urged authority protect lesser known equally significant monument take pride history
"India’s southern state of Tamil Nadu is braced for more downpours after heavy monsoon rains brought deadly flash floods and submerged entire neighborhoods earlier this week. The Indian Meteorological Department (MET) forecast further heavy rain after more than 400 millimeters (15.7 inches) fell in parts of the state from Sunday into Monday. That’s nearly half of what Tamil Nadu typically receives in a year, according to a CNN Weather analysis of MET data. At least 10 people died in the flooding, Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary Shiv Das Meena told reporters on Tuesday. The downpour also occurred as the state of 72 million people reels from the aftermath of Cyclone Michaung, which battered Tamil Nadu earlier this month, killing at least 12 people. Video and photo broadcast on local television this week showed people wading waist-deep in the muddy water. Indian Air Force helicopters have been dropping food and essential items to people stranded on rooftops, according to video published by the country’s defense ministry. The deluge had weakened since December 18 with conditions improving for rescue crews. India’s northeast monsoon usually runs from October to December, bringing heavy rain, particularly to the south. Parts of southern India have in recent years experienced spells of extremely heavy rainfall, destroying houses, flooding roads, and claiming dozens of lives. In 2021, at least 35 people were killed after heavy rains battered the region. A few months earlier, 16 people were killed in another spell of downpours in Tamil Nadu. While floods occur regularly during India’s monsoon seasons, experts say climate change is increasing their frequency and severity. The world’s most populous nation is one of the countries worst affected by the climate crisis, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – potentially affecting 1.4 billion people nationwide.",neutral,india southern state tamil nadu braced downpour heavy monsoon rain brought deadly flash flood submerged entire neighborhood earlier week indian meteorological department met forecast heavy rain millimeter inch fell part state sunday monday thats nearly half tamil nadu typically receives year according cnn weather analysis met data least people died flooding tamil nadu chief secretary shiv da meena told reporter tuesday downpour also occurred state million people reel aftermath cyclone michaung battered tamil nadu earlier month killing least people video photo broadcast local television week showed people wading waistdeep muddy water indian air force helicopter dropping food essential item people stranded rooftop according video published country defense ministry deluge weakened since december condition improving rescue crew india northeast monsoon usually run october december bringing heavy rain particularly south part southern india recent year experienced spell extremely heavy rainfall destroying house flooding road claiming dozen life least people killed heavy rain battered region month earlier people killed another spell downpour tamil nadu flood occur regularly india monsoon season expert say climate change increasing frequency severity world populous nation one country worst affected climate crisis according intergovernmental panel climate change potentially affecting billion people nationwide
"For the uninitiated the idea of playing a Test cricket match over five days and that the result might end up as a draw can sometimes be hard to fathom. On Thursday, India accelerated this format of cricket – and then some – by defeating South Africa by seven wickets in the shortest completed Test match ever, requiring less than two days to secure victory. The match has become the shortest decided game in terms of overs bowled in the history of Test cricket. Just 107 overs were bowled across the four innings in the match held at Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town, South Africa. On a remarkable first day of action on Wednesday, 23 wickets fell as South Africa was bowled out for just 55 runs before toppling India for 153. India lost its final six wickets for no runs in a remarkable collapse. South Africa then returned to the crease to start its second innings and ended the opening day on 62-3. Day two on Thursday saw more of the same despite the Proteas’ Aiden Markram’s valiant effort to stem the flow of wickets falling. Markram scored a remarkable 106 from just 103 balls with the team’s next highest score just 12 runs. South Africa eventually fell for 176, leaving India with a modest 79-run target to win the  match.

"Starbucks plans to operate 1,000 stores in India by 2028, opening the equivalent of one new location every three days for the next four years, as demand for coffee burgeons in the world’s fastest-growing major economy. To achieve its target, the company will focus on opening coffee shops in smaller cities and also double its workforce in the country to 8,600, it said in a statement Tuesday. Starbucks currently has 390 stores in India, where it has operated for over 11 years through a 50% joint venture with Tata Consumer Products, a unit of one of India’s best-known conglomerates. Its first location was Mumbai, where it opened a two-level store furnished with local furniture and decorated with images of the metropolis. Apart from the usual range of lattes and Frappuccinos, Starbucks also offers beverages that it calls “Indian-inspired,” including South Indian filter coffee and masala chai, a blend of sweetened milky tea and spices. While many Indians still begin their day with a steaming cup of chai, the appetite for coffee is growing, with both local and international chains proliferating across the country. During a visit to India this week, Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said India had become “one of Starbucks’ fastest-growing markets in the world.” The South Asian nation, with its growing middle class, is becoming a key market for Western companies, especially at a time when China is grappling with a number of economic problems, including muted consumer demand. However, despite the slowdown in China, the latter is still Starbucks’ largest and fastest-growing overseas market. The beverage giant aims to have 9,000 stores there by 2025, up from nearly 6,500 currently. Last year, Starbucks poured more than $200 million into a new campus in the eastern part of China. At the time of opening in September, the company said it was the largest investment it had ever made for a coffee manufacturing and distribution center outside the United States.",positive,starbucks plan operate store india opening equivalent one new location every three day next four year demand coffee burgeons world fastestgrowing major economy achieve target company focus opening coffee shop smaller city also double workforce country said statement tuesday starbucks currently store india operated year joint venture tata consumer product unit one india bestknown conglomerate first location mumbai opened twolevel store furnished local furniture decorated image metropolis apart usual range latte frappuccinos starbucks also offer beverage call indianinspired including south indian filter coffee masala chai blend sweetened milky tea spice many indian still begin day steaming cup chai appetite coffee growing local international chain proliferating across country visit india week starbucks ceo laxman narasimhan said india become one starbucks fastestgrowing market world south asian nation growing middle class becoming key market western company especially time china grappling number economic problem including muted consumer demand however despite slowdown china latter still starbucks largest fastestgrowing overseas market beverage giant aim store nearly currently last year starbucks poured million new campus eastern part china time opening september company said largest investment ever made coffee manufacturing distribution center outside united state
"The next few weeks could shape the future of Walt Disney in the world’s most populous country. The Star India network was among the crown jewels Disney (DIS) acquired when it bought most of 21st Century Fox from Rupert Murdoch for $71 billion five years ago. With that blockbuster deal, the Magical Kingdom took over Fox’s business in India, gaining a new audience of more than 700 million people in the South Asian country, one of the world’s hottest media markets. But Disney hasn’t had the happily ever after it was hoping for. CEO Bob Iger admitted in an earnings call late last year that “parts of that business [in India] are challenged for us.” The House of Mouse was hit particularly hard in 2022 after it lost the digital rights to stream the hugely popular Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches to billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s conglomerate. The US company is now trying to salvage its India dream. Disney and Ambani’s Reliance industries are reportedly discussing combining their Indian media businesses to form an entertainment behemoth in which the Indian tycoon would have the upper hand. The companies have appointed law firms and started antitrust diligence on the merger, Reuters reported last week, citing unnamed sources. Ambani’s energy-to-telecom conglomerate would own 51%, and Disney would hold the remaining 49%, The Economic Times had reported in December, citing unnamed sources. The merger is likely to be completed by next month, the Indian newspaper added. Disney did not respond to CNN’s request for comment, while Reliance declined to comment. Disney’s search for a partner in the world’s fastest growing major economy comes at a time when the Burbank-headquartered company is facing a range of problems on home turf too. Like its competitors, the 100-year-old Hollywood stalwart faces an uncertain environment in the United States as viewers increasingly tune out linear TV in favor of TikTok and YouTube. But Disney has been hit particularly hard by some big misses at the box office and corporate upheaval. Iger said in November that the company is “looking … expansively” in India and “considering our options there,” but also added that he would “like to stay in that market.” It’s easy to see why. With its relatively free market and vast English speaking population, India is an attractive country for global entertainment companies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government expects the nation soon to become the world’s third largest media and entertainment market, from fifth currently. With its Fox acquisition, Disney was served that market on a platter. Star India had built its vast audience by spending billions on the rights to broadcast some of India’s biggest sports, including the country’s national obsession — cricket. In 2017, it beat Facebook (META) and Sony (SONY) to a $2.6 billion deal for five years for the IPL, one of the world’s most valuable sports properties. The network’s other big advantage was its local content. In a country where nearly two dozen languages are spoken, Star India offers over 70 TV channels in 9 languages. Still, Disney has struggled to seize the opportunity. While its TV business is doing well in India, Iger said in November, the company was struggling in other areas. Its streaming app, Hotstar, has shed millions of subscribers since it lost the IPL rights to Reliance almost two years ago. In March 2023, Hotstar suffered another blow when it stopped streaming HBO content. Weeks later, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), the parent company of both HBO and CNN, moved its content to Ambani’s JioCinema, taking loyal Indian viewers of hit shows such as “Game of Thrones” and “Succession” along with them. Apart from those losses to Ambani, analysts have questioned Disney’s strategy in India, particularly its aggressive spending on sports. The company’s “entertainment assets would be attractive to any acquirer or partner …[but] … Disney’s India sports business has faced challenges.” noted Mihir Shah, vice president of research firm Media Partners Asia. While Disney lost the digital rights for IPL matches in 2022, it did retain the TV rights until 2027 by paying more than $3 billion. It also kept the rights to show the International Cricket Council’s tournaments to 2027 for another “staggering $3 billion,” Shah said. Financial difficulties for the business will continue in the coming years, “largely attributed to Disney’s aggressive bidding in renewing rights,” he added. The media giant has also failed to fully capitalize on its streaming service’s “technical prowess” not just because of the loss of IPL but also “limited investments in local entertainment content,” Shah said. The American company’s missteps come at a time when competition is intensifying in India — the potential Reliance-Disney deal isn’t the only merger in the works. Sony and India’s Zee Entertainment have been in talks for over two years to merge their operations and create a $10 billion giant. The fate of that deal is still unclear, but analysts say such corporate marriages will be key to achieving scale and competing with global streaming giants such as Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN), which have both established a big presence in India. “These potential deals are a sign that India’s entertainment industry is entering a phase of consolidation, where only a handful of players with deep pockets will be able operate,” said Aliasgar Shakir, an analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. In his November earnings call, Iger said Disney not only wants to continue in India, but also aims to “see whether we can strengthen our hand … improve the bottom line.” Ambani, Asia’s second richest man, with his billions and deepening media ambitions, can help Disney do more than that. The merged entity would be massive, with over 100 TV channels and two streaming platforms. “It is too early to interpret this as Disney scaling back in India,” Shah said. “The contours of the deal are still unknown, but it is looking more like a partnership between Reliance Industries and Disney. “ It could also be the start of a power couple that goes beyond media, with industry insiders speculating about a combined push into theme parks. “We have to remember that both these companies have business interests beyond media and entertainment, and this partnership could be a start of something bigger,” Shah said.",neutral,next week could shape future walt disney world populous country star india network among crown jewel disney dis acquired bought st century fox rupert murdoch

"Boeing is getting some respite from what has been a month of terrible news. India’s newest airline is purchasing 150 Boeing 737 Max aircraft, in the first major order the troubled planemaker has announced since the dramatic Alaska Airlines incident in which part of the fuselage of a 737 Max 9 fell off mid-flight. Akasa Air has ordered the 737 Max 10 and 737 Max 8-200 aircraft to be delivered through 2032, the airline said at an event in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad. The order does not include Max 9 planes, which have been grounded by US regulators since the in-flight blowout. Boeing said the order was finalized in December. “The efficiency and versatility of the 737-10 and 737-8-200 will support Akasa Air’s expansion to meet soaring demand for air travel in the region for many years to come,” Stephanie Pope, Boeing’s chief operating officer, said in a statement on Thursday. Earlier this month, an Alaska Airlines flight carrying 177 people made an emergency landing shortly after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, after part of the wall of the new aircraft detached and left a gaping hole in the side of the plane. It’s a huge new blow for the reputation of the 737 Max, which was grounded for 20 months after crashes in 2018 in Indonesia and early 2019 in Ethopia killed all 346 people on board the flights. Boeing’s (BA) shares have plunged almost 20% this month. Analysts at Wells Fargo this week warned that the ongoing investigation into the Alaska Airlines incident will open “a whole new can of worms” for the aircraft manufacturer, which has been facing quality control and engineering problems for years. On Wednesday, the US Federal Aviation Administration said it was expanding its probe to include Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), which builds the fuselage of the 737 Max 9. In another high-profile embarrassment for Boeing this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was forced to change planes to return to Washington from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, after his modified Boeing 737 plane suffered what the traveling press was told was a critical failure related to an oxygen leak. At the airshow in India, Vinay Dube, the founder and CEO of Akasa Air, said his airline  pursues “the highest standards of safety in global aviation.” “This large and historic aircraft order puts Akasa on a path of becoming one of the top 30 leading airlines in the world, by the turn of this decade,” he added. Akasa Air, which was launched in 2022, is not the only Indian carrier that is buying a lot of Boeing planes. Last year, Air India said it would buy 220 Boeing planes. That order, one of the largest in Boeing’s history, was announced by President Joe Biden after a call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India’s aviation market is growing at a rapid pace, and Modi’s government believes it can become the world’s largest by 2047.",positive,boeing getting respite month terrible news india newest airline purchasing boeing max aircraft first major order troubled planemaker announced since dramatic alaska airline incident part fuselage max fell midflight akasa air ordered max max aircraft delivered airline said event southern indian city hyderabad order include max plane grounded u regulator since inflight blowout boeing said order finalized december efficiency versatility support akasa air expansion meet soaring demand air travel region many year come stephanie pope boeings chief operating officer said statement thursday earlier month alaska airline flight carrying people made emergency landing shortly takeoff portland oregon part wall new aircraft detached left gaping hole side plane huge new blow reputation max grounded month crash indonesia early ethopia killed people board flight boeings ba share plunged almost month analyst well fargo week warned ongoing investigation alaska airline incident open whole new worm aircraft manufacturer facing quality control engineering problem year wednesday u federal aviation administration said expanding probe include spirit aerosystems spr build fuselage max another highprofile embarrassment boeing week u secretary state antony blinken forced change plane return washington world economic forum davos switzerland modified boeing plane suffered traveling press told critical failure related oxygen leak airshow india vinay dube founder ceo akasa air said airline pursues highest standard safety global aviation large historic aircraft order put akasa path becoming one top leading airline world turn decade added akasa air launched indian carrier buying lot boeing plane last year air india said would buy boeing plane order one largest boeings history announced president joe biden call indian prime minister narendra modi india aviation market growing rapid pace modis government belief become world largest
"Saffron flags are flying in the majority Hindu town of Ayodhya as excited locals prepare to host Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the inauguration of a new multimillion-dollar temple. But like many of the town’s 500,000 Muslims, 65-year-old Maulana Badshah Khan says he’ll be staying at home. He fears a repeat of the religious violence that erupted more than 30 years ago, when Hindu nationalists destroyed the Babri Masjid, a 16th century mosque, triggering riots across the country. On Monday, Modi will officially open the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, a lavish temple built on the same site that analysts say is a monument to Hindu nationalist ambition. Khan says he believes the celebration is a clear sign of how Muslims are becoming marginalized under the leadership of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “The wounds of Babri Mosque’s demolition will always be there. Even if we feel despondent about voicing them,” said Khan. “The temple holds the symbolic value of showing the Muslims their place in New India.” More than 7,000 people have been invited to Ayodhya to attend the ceremony in person, including high-profile politicians who are flying in from across the vast country to take part. And tens of thousands of pious Hindus are thronging to the small town to place flowers and gifts inside the temple. Amid these increasing crowds, there is apprehension among Ayodhya’s Muslims. Azam Qadri, the 39-year-old head of a local religious body, said that those who lived through the 1992 violence fear the arrival of outsiders. “Every time people come from outside there is trouble. One cannot afford to lose their precious belongings, savings, or identity papers anymore. It is not easy to restart your life again,” he said. Haji Mahboob, who lost two relatives during the 1992 violence, said local Muslims are worried the emboldened crowds will chant provocative slogans against them. “They will call for Muslims to be expelled from Ayodhya or demand a Hindu Rashtra (nation),” he said. Mahboob said there is now a sense of hopelessness among his community. Many Muslims believed that in 2019, when the Supreme Court granted Hindus permission to build the temple on the contested site, the controversy might come to an end, he said. But instead, emboldened Hindus began targeting even more mosques across the country, campaigning to tear those down too. “The Hindus cannot stand us, they cannot see us, what can we do?” he said. Modi rose to power in 2014 with a pledge to reform the country’s economy and usher in a new era of development – but he also heavily pushed a Hindutva agenda, an ideology that believes India should become a land for Hindus. Many states have passed legislation that critics say is rooted in Hindutva and discriminatory toward Muslims, including laws that make it increasingly difficult for interfaith couples to marry and banning the slaughter and transport of cows – an animal considered sacred to Hindus. And one of Modi’s key promises to his voters was to build the Ram Temple on the desecrated mosque’s site, and he’s hoping its construction will firm his chances for a rare third election win this year. Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, author of “The Demolition and the Verdict,” a book about the 1992 mosque demolition, said Modi’s decision to preside over Monday’s festivities is a sign of Hindu hegemony in India. Modi’s involvement in the ceremony is indicative of how the line between the state and religion is becoming increasingly blurred, he said. Mukhopadhyay added the sentiment among Muslims is not one of celebration. He has heard that Muslims are advising each other not to travel by train, not to drive cars alone and not to wear clothing that identifies them as Muslim. “There is going to be immense sadness and there is also going to be tremendous fear (among India’s Muslims),” he said. Speaking to CNN, BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said Muslims are not being marginalized in India, and that the inauguration of the Ram Mandir is a “cause for celebration.” “In terms of Prime Minister Modi’s government’s work, initiatives, and developmental agenda, not one scheme, program, or anything, distinguishes between Indian citizens on the basis of religion, caste, region,” he said. In the years following the demolition of the Babri Masjid, Hindu nationalists rallied to build the Ram Mandir on the site of the destroyed mosque, setting the stage for an emotional and politically charged showdown that worried Indian liberals, who feared more outbursts of sectarian violence. That 2019 judgement that paved the way for the building of the Ram Mandir also allocated land for the town’s Muslims to build another mosque, some 25 kilometers (about 15 miles) from the Ram Mandir in a village called Dhannipur. Mahboob, one of the petitioners who fought for the Babri mosque in the Supreme Court, said for most Muslims of Ayodhya, its construction does not hold emotional sway. “If they built the mosque close to where Babri stood, we could have tried to convince ourselves that injustice was not happening to us. However, this land is so far away, and over that the construction has not even begun. So what do we say?” Late last year, Arafat Shaikh – a member of the BJP – was appointed to lead the construction of the mosque. He told CNN that he had never stepped foot in Ayodhya before he took on the role. He said the delays were due to disagreements about the design of the building but believes the new mosque will be unique as it will be the first in India with five minarets. Amongst other ambitious plans, Shaikh says he wants additional land for educational institutions, a vegetarian kitchen, and a 21-foot-long Quran which will be painted saffron – a color closely associated with Hinduism but one that has become increasingly politicized and appropriated by the Hindu-right. Shaikh said the color was chosen because Gharib Nawaz, a famous Sufi saint, also revered saffron. “It will bring the two communities closer,” he said. Right-wing Hindu nationalist organizations say the temple’s opening is a symbol of a new Hindu nation. “The Mughals tried to change us, then the English tried to change us, but the inauguration of the Ram Temple shows the world that our Hindu traditions, practices, and beliefs are still intact. New India will see a resurrection of the Hindu civilization,” said Vinod Bansal, spokesperson of the right-wing Vishwa Hindu Parishad group. Mahant Jairam Das, the local head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the parent organization of the BJP, said he does not believe the mosque should not be built in Ayodhya, instead claiming calls to build the structure were a “call for war.” “Go to Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, or a Muslim-dominated country. Why build a mosque like this in India?” he said. For Hassan Ali, who was just nine when he spent two nights in a local police station trying to escape the 1992 violence, the sectarian fault lines are clearly visible. “In 1992 there were many stories of local Hindus and Muslims helping each other. However now, there is a lot more poison that has been fed to people,” he said. “So one cannot tell anymore. One cannot tell what people have in their hearts.”",negative,saffron flag flying majority hindu town ayodhya excited local prepare host indian prime minister narendra modi inauguration new multimilliondollar temple like many town muslim yearold maulana badshah khan say hell staying home fear repeat religious violence erupted year ago hindu nationalist destroyed babri masjid th century mosque triggering riot across country monday modi officially open ram janmabhoomi mandir lavish temple built site analyst say monument hindu nationalist ambition khan say belief celebration clear sign muslim becoming marginalized leadership modis bharatiya janata party bjp wound babri mosque demolition always even feel despondent voicing said khan temple hold symbolic value showing muslim place new india people invited ayodhya attend ceremony person including highprofile politician flying across vast country take part ten thousand pious hindu thronging small town place flower gift inside temple amid increasing crowd apprehension among ayodhyas muslim azam qadri yearold head local religious body said lived violence fear arrival outsider every time people come outside trouble one afford lose precious belonging saving identity paper anymore easy restart life said haji mahboob lost two relative violence said local muslim worried emboldened crowd chant provocative slogan call muslim expelled ayodhya demand hindu rashtra nation said mahboob said sense hopelessness among community many muslim believed supreme court granted hindu permission build temple contested site controversy might come end said instead emboldened hindu began targeting even mosque across country campaigning tear hindu stand u see u said modi rose power pledge reform country economy usher new era development also heavily pushed hindutva agenda ideology belief india become land hindu many state passed legislation critic say rooted hindutva discriminatory toward muslim including law make increasingly difficult interfaith couple marry banning slaughter transport cow animal considered sacred hindu one modis key promise voter build ram temple desecrated mosque site he hoping construction firm chance rare third election win year nilanjan mukhopadhyay author demolition verdict book mosque demolition said modis decision preside monday festivity sign hindu hegemony india modis involvement ceremony indicative line state religion becoming increasingly blurred said mukhopadhyay added sentiment among muslim one celebration heard muslim advising travel train drive car alone wear clothing identifies muslim going immense sadness also going tremendous fear among india muslim said speaking cnn bjp spokesperson nalin kohli said muslim marginalized india inauguration ram mandir cause celebration term prime minister modis government work initiative developmental agenda one scheme program anything distinguishes indian citizen basis religion caste region said year following demolition babri masjid hindu nationalist rallied build ram mandir site destroyed mosque setting stage emotional politically charged showdown worried indian liberal feared outburst sectarian violence judgement paved way building ram mandir also allocated land town muslim build another mosque kilometer mile ram mandir village called dhannipur mahboob one petitioner fought babri mosque supreme court said muslim ayodhya construction hold emotional sway built mosque close babri stood could tried convince injustice happening u however land far away construction even begun say late last year arafat shaikh member bjp appointed lead construction mosque told cnn never stepped foot ayodhya took role said delay due disagreement design building belief new mosque unique first india five minaret amongst ambitious plan shaikh say want additional land educational institution vegetarian kitchen footlong quran painted saffron color closely associated hinduism one become increasingly politicized appropriated hinduright shaikh said color chosen gharib nawaz famous sufi saint also revered saffron bring two community closer said rightwing hindu nationalist organization say temple opening symbol new hindu nation mughals tried change u english tried change u inauguration ram temple show world hindu tradition practice belief still intact new india see resurrection hindu civilization said vinod bansal spokesperson rightwing vishwa hindu parishad group mahant jairam da local head rashtriya swayamsevak sangh parent organization bjp said believe mosque built ayodhya instead claiming call build structure call war go saudi arabia pakistan muslimdominated country build mosque like india said hassan ali nine spent two night local police station trying escape violence sectarian fault line clearly visible many story local hindu muslim helping however lot poison fed people said one tell anymore one tell people heart
"A top Pakistan official on Thursday accused India of killing two Pakistani nationals on its soil, citing what he called “a pattern” of alleged Indian assassination plots overseas and raising tensions between the two nuclear-armed rivals. In a news conference, Pakistani Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi claimed Islamabad has “credible evidence” linking Indian agents to the killing of Muhammad Riaz in Pakistan-administered Kashmir on September 8 last year and of Shahid Latif in the city of Sialkot, near Kashmir, a month later. “These were killings-for-hire cases involving a sophisticated international setup spread over multiple jurisdictions,” Qazi said. He accused two Indian agents of recruiting assassins to kill the men – both slain in the vicinity of mosques – but did not provide further information about the victims or suggest why New Delhi might have targeted them. India has long accused Pakistan of harboring terrorists, particularly in the disputed and heavily militarized region of Kashmir, which both countries claim in its entirety. A de facto border called the Line of Control divides it between New Delhi and Islamabad. The dispute has led to three wars between the two nations. Qazi on Thursday compared the alleged killings in Pakistan to other purported recent Indian assassination plots in North America. “They fit the pattern of similar cases which have come to light in other countries including Canada and the United States,” Qazi said. “Clearly the Indian network of extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings has become a global phenomenon.” India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) rejected Qazi’s allegations, calling them “Pakistan’s latest attempt at peddling false and malicious anti-India propaganda.” “As the world knows, Pakistan has long been the epicenter of terrorism, organized crime, and illegal transnational activities. India and many other countries have publicly warned Pakistan cautioning that it would be consumed by its own culture of terror and violence,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said. “Pakistan will reap what it sows.” Last November, the US accused an Indian government official of being involved in a conspiracy to kill an American citizen on its home soil. The revelation came a little over a month after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly alleged that India may have been involved in the murder of a Canadian national on its territory, prompting a furious response from New Delhi and a diplomatic fallout between the two countries. The Indian government has denied involvement in the American and Canadian cases and has set up a high-level committee to investigate the accusations in the US.",negative,top pakistan official thursday accused india killing two pakistani national soil citing called pattern alleged indian assassination plot overseas raising tension two nucleararmed rival news conference pakistani foreign secretary muhammad syrus sajjad qazi claimed islamabad credible evidence linking indian agent killing muhammad riaz pakistanadministered kashmir september last year shahid latif city sialkot near kashmir month later killingsforhire case involving sophisticated international setup spread multiple jurisdiction qazi said accused two indian agent recruiting assassin kill men slain vicinity mosque provide information victim suggest new delhi might targeted india long accused pakistan harboring terrorist particularly disputed heavily militarized region kashmir country claim entirety de facto border called line control divide new delhi islamabad dispute led three war two nation qazi thursday compared alleged killing pakistan purported recent indian assassination plot north america fit pattern similar case come light country including canada united state qazi said clearly indian network extrajudicial extraterritorial killing become global phenomenon india ministry external affair mea rejected qazis allegation calling pakistan latest attempt peddling false malicious antiindia propaganda world know pakistan long epicenter terrorism organized crime illegal transnational activity india many country publicly warned pakistan cautioning would consumed culture terror violence mea spokesperson randhir jaiswal said pakistan reap sow last november u accused indian government official involved conspiracy kill american citizen home soil revelation came little month canadian prime minister justin trudeau publicly alleged india may involved murder canadian national territory prompting furious response new delhi diplomatic fallout two country indian government denied involvement american canadian case set highlevel committee investigate accusation u
"The consecration of a controversial Hindu temple symbolizes the seismic shift from India’s secular founding values, analysts say, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi disregards norms separating religion from state in his push to win a rare third term this year. Modi presided over a lavish opening ceremony last month of the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir in the sacred town of Ayodhya, fulfilling a longstanding promise to voters that helped propel him and his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to power in 2014. “(Today) is the beginning of a new time cycle,” Modi said at the new temple honoring Hindu deity Lord Ram. “After centuries of waiting, our Ram has arrived.” Modi’s vision of a “divine India” is a far cry from the ideas of the modern country’s founding fathers. During nearly a decade in power, the prime minister has enveloped himself in the language of religion in pursuit of his Hindu nationalist agenda, isolating millions among India’s sizable religious minorities. “This moment is both a culmination of a political project that has been 100 years in the making, and a new departure for India, no longer a secular republic,” said political scientist Gilles Verniers, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi. “India becomes a de facto Hindu nation, where the task of building national Hindu religious symbols falls to the state. And in which its leader officiates simultaneously as prime minister and head priest for the country.” The Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir stands on the site of the Babri Masjid, a 16th century mosque that was destroyed by hardline Hindus in 1992, setting off a wave of deadly sectarian violence not seen in India since its bloody 1947 partition. The temple’s inauguration was attended by thousands of hand-picked guests – including cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar and billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani – and streamed live to millions across the country. In Ayodhya, billboards celebrating the temple’s opening featured an image of Hindu deity Ram alongside Modi’s face, with the leader of his BJP even dubbing the prime minister “The King of Gods.” Modi fasted for 11 days in a purification ritual before the event and visited temples across the country, performing customs sacramental to India’s majority faith. He publicly called himself “an instrument” of Lord Ram, anointed by the divine to “represent all the people of India.” At the consecration, Modi presided over the “Pran Pratishtha” – the unveiling of the much-anticipated Ram idol – taking on a role typically reserved for priests. The move was well received in most quarters, with his supporters praising the leader’s actions. But for some Hindus, Modi’s actions represent a betrayal of their religion for political capital. “This is obviously an electoral stunt, it should not be happening in the name of my faith,” said Indian American activist Sunita Viswanath and member of the US-based Hindus for Human Rights group in a statement the day before the temple opening. “Modi is not a priest, so leading this ceremony for political gain is both technically and morally wrong. This weaponization of our religion tramples what’s left of India’s secular democratic values.” Yet, in blurring the lines between state and religion, Modi has achieved what his predecessors were unable to, analysts say. “Much of this is about solidifying his image in India as someone who is devout, someone who delivers on his promises,” said Foreign Policy editor-in-chief and former CNN New Delhi bureau chief, Ravi Agrawal. “This is a very popular move, and while it’s being criticized… it remains popular in a country that is 80% Hindu.” Modi rose to power in 2014 with a pledge to reform India’s economy and usher in a new era of development – but he also heavily pushed a Hindutva agenda, an ideology that believes India should become a land for Hindus. When he stood for reelection in 2019, Modi’s Hindutva policies became more brazen, according to analysts. A few months after winning, he announced he was stripping the statehood of India’s only Muslim-majority territory, Jammu and Kashmir, and turning it into two union territories while bringing it under federal control. Later that year, his government passed a controversial citizenship law considered by many to be discriminatory against Muslims. And he reiterated his party’s desire to build the Ram Temple on the contested holy site. Many Hindus believe the Babri Masjid was built on the ruins of a Hindu temple, allegedly destroyed in 1528 by Babar, the first Mughal emperor of South Asia. For years, they rallied to tear down the mosque and make way for a temple. The dispute reached its climax in 1992 when, spurred on by the BJP and right-wing groups, Hindu hardliners attacked the mosque, triggering widespread communal violence that killed more than 2,000 people nationwide. In a victory for Modi and his supporters, India’s Supreme Court in 2019 granted Hindus permission to build the temple, ending the decades-long dispute – but dealing a blow to millions of Muslims who fear that religious divisions are becoming more pronounced under Modi’s BJP government. The Indian government denies it is discriminating against minorities, but analysts say last week’s festivities have only emboldened right-wing Hindus to act with impunity against minorities. Communal tensions rose in western Maharashtra state, with three reported altercations between Hindus and Muslims, according to local police. In a separate incident in central Madhya Pradesh state, a group of right-wing Hindus was seen placing saffron flags on top of a Christian church. The color is closely associated with Hinduism. “India has become more majoritarian. India has become more nationalist. India has become more pro-Hindu,” Agrawal said. “This is partly due to the government’s ability to point to India’s history and the wrongs they perceive India to have faced.” Since assuming power nearly a decade ago, Modi has positioned himself as a disrupter of India’s colonial legacy, often in speeches marked by emotive language. He has emphasized the need to “liberate (India) from the slavery mindset,” making steps to steer the country away from what the government has called the “vestiges of British rule.” Similarly, Modi has also made comments about India’s erstwhile Islamic rulers, the Mughals, who ruled much of the country from 1526 to 1858. Many hardline Hindus believe the era was a period of oppression under Muslim rule, a view that has also been echoed by some members of the BJP. Hindu groups have for decades claimed the Mughals destroyed Hindu temples, building mosques and other monuments in their place. Many of these cases are now being debated in courts across the country, in a move Indian liberals fear could spark further violence and disharmony. Just this week, a court in the city of Varanasi ruled that Hindus can pray inside the disputed Gyanvapi mosque built by former Mughal ruler Aurangzeb - purportedly on the site of a destroyed Hindu temple – in another major religious dispute. “Aurangzeb severed many heads, but he could not shake our faith,” Modi said in a 2022 speech, referring to the ruler who died more than three centuries ago. As the country heads toward a national election expected to be held in April and May, the government “sees itself as addressing these injustices,” said Foreign Policy’s Agrawal. Gilles, the political scientist, said last week’s display of Hindu nationalism at the Ram Temple shows the strength of the alliance between the BJP and India’s business and cultural elites. The temple’s inauguration was a “dark day for India’s religious minorities,” he said. “(They) have officially become second-class citizens.”",negative,consecration controversial hindu temple

"India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday inaugurated Abu Dhabi’s first Hindu temple, the largest in the United Arab Emirates, boosting his credentials as a global statesman months before he heads to the polls in a nationwide election where he is seeking a rare third term in power. The BAPS Hindu Mandir, built on a sprawling 27-acre site in the Abu Dhabi desert, is the city’s first traditional Hindu stone mandir, its pink sandstone columns topped by seven spires representing the number of Sheikhs that rule each of the Emirates. Modi was greeted with a hug by the country’s President, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and presented with the Guard of Honor, showing how close the two nations have come in their strategic and economic relations. But while Islam is the official religion of the UAE, Modi’s trip comes as Muslims in India say they feel marginalized and threatened as Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party’s Hindu nationalist policies gain momentum in the world’s largest democracy. Yet, analysts expect this will not present an issue for Modi during his visit, given India’s rising prominence, its growing economy and strategic position on the global stage. And back home, analysts say Modi’s leading role in the temple’s inauguration could give his party a boost in the buildup to the election in a few months’ time. In his decade of power, Modi has created an image of himself as “the protector of Hinduism,” said New Delhi based political analyst Asim Ali, and is now taking that message beyond India’s borders. “He’s hoisting the flag of Hinduism across the world. It’s like the religion and pride of India going overseas,” Ali said. “He’s sending a message to the world: India is the protector of the Hindu religion.” The opening of the Abu Dhabi Temple comes just a few weeks after Modi inaugurated the controversial Ram Mandir, a temple built on the foundations of a centuries-old mosque that was torn down by hardline Hindu crowds in the early 1990s in northern India. That ceremony was seen as a seismic shift away from modern India’s secular founding principles and was hailed by Hindu nationalists as a crowning moment in their decades-long campaign to reshape the nation. The temple opening in Abu Dhabi “must be seen as a political operation for Modi vis-à-vis constituencies abroad and at home,” said Nicolas Blarel, Associate Professor of International Relations at the Institute of Political Science, Leiden University in The Netherlands. The temple has a storied history as its UAE-based devotees have long advocated for its construction, said Blarel, who focuses on foreign policy in South Asia and the Middle East. The country of 9 million is home to about 3.5 million Indian nationals alone, making it the largest population of Indian citizens in the world. In 2015, the UAE government allocated land for the development of the temple, in a major win for the diaspora. “This then became a joint venture as both the Indian and UAE governments entrusted the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha the responsibility to build and administer the mandir,” Blarel said. “Nine years later, this important cultural and political project has been materialized and framed by the BJP and Modi as further evidence of the global reach of India’s religious and cultural heritage, but also of cooperation with its diaspora.” This is the Indian Prime Minister’s seventh trip to the Islamic country, and the third in the last eight months, indicating its importance to Modi in the lead up to the election. “India-UAE relations have grown in economic terms, but perhaps more significantly in strategic and security terms,” said Kadira Pethiyagoda, a former diplomat and Brookings Fellow. “This is the product of India seeking to expand its strategic reach into the Middle East and secure its energy sources,” added Pethiyagoda, author of “Indian Foreign Policy and Cultural Values.” In a bid to boost the industrial sector and lift exports, the Indian government has sought to sign free trade deals, a move that’s been warmly received around the world. Last September, US President Joe Biden, Modi and the leaders of the UAE and Saudi Arabia announced the launch of a new trade route connecting India to the Middle East and Europe through railways and ports. India’s billionaires, including Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, have also invested big money in the country. Last August, the UAE was among six countries invited to join the BRICS bloc, which India is a part of. “The UAE, like the other Gulf states, has been trying in recent years to diversify its strategic and security partnerships with Great Powers,” said Pethiyagoda. “This means moving away from sole reliance on the US toward partnerships with India, China and Russia.” Given these reasons, analysts say there is little chance UAE will bring up the criticism of Modi’s government over its treatment of Muslims. “If they do bring it up, it will be in private,” Pethiyagoda said. “Gulf governments have always taken a practical approach of non-interference in domestic affairs of major powers.” And it’s also unclear how much extra support the UAE temple will give a prime minister already popular with devout Hindu followers. The BAPS temple “will not win him much more adulation amongst BJP supporting Hindus than the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya has already garnered,” Pethiyagoda said. “It may however win votes in the South where much of India’s Gulf workforce hails from and sends their remittances to, and where the BJP is weaker.” He added: “It could also, if promoted properly, help to improve his reputation amongst some Muslim voters to whom it could be portrayed as Hindu-Muslim friendship.”",positive,india prime minister narendra modi wednesday inaugurated abu dhabis first hindu temple largest united arab emirate boosting credential global statesman month head poll nationwide election seeking rare third term power bap hindu mandir built sprawling acre site abu dhabi desert city first traditional hindu stone mandir pink sandstone column topped seven spire representing number sheikh rule emirate modi greeted hug country president sheikh mohamed bin zayed al nahyan presented guard honor showing close two nation come strategic economic relation islam official religion uae modis trip come muslim india say feel marginalized threatened modis bharatiya janata party hindu nationalist policy gain momentum world largest democracy yet analyst expect present issue modi visit given india rising prominence growing economy strategic position global stage back home analyst say modis leading role temple inauguration could give party boost buildup election month time decade power modi created image protector hinduism said new delhi based political analyst asim ali taking message beyond india border he hoisting flag hinduism across world like religion pride india going overseas ali said he sending message world india protector hindu religion opening abu dhabi temple come week modi inaugurated controversial ram mandir temple built foundation centuriesold mosque torn hardline hindu crowd early northern india ceremony seen seismic shift away modern india secular founding principle hailed hindu nationalist crowning moment decadeslong campaign reshape nation temple opening abu dhabi must seen political operation modi visvis constituency abroad home said nicolas blarel associate professor international relation institute political science leiden university netherlands temple storied history uaebased devotee long advocated construction said blarel focus foreign policy south asia middle east country million home million indian national alone making largest population indian citizen world uae government allocated land development temple major win diaspora became joint venture indian uae government entrusted bap swaminarayan sanstha responsibility build administer mandir blarel said nine year later important cultural political project materialized framed bjp modi evidence global reach india religious cultural heritage also cooperation diaspora indian prime minister seventh trip islamic country third last eight month indicating importance modi lead election indiauae relation grown economic term perhaps significantly strategic security term said kadira pethiyagoda former diplomat brookings fellow product india seeking expand strategic reach middle east secure energy source added pethiyagoda author indian foreign policy cultural value bid boost industrial sector lift export indian government sought sign free trade deal move thats warmly received around world last september u president joe biden modi leader uae saudi arabia announced launch new trade route connecting india middle east europe railway port india billionaire including mukesh ambani gautam adani also invested big money country last august uae among six country invited join brics bloc india part uae like gulf state trying recent year diversify strategic security partnership great power said pethiyagoda mean moving away sole reliance u toward partnership india china russia given reason analyst say little chance uae bring criticism modis government treatment muslim bring private pethiyagoda said gulf government always taken practical approach noninterference domestic affair major power also unclear much extra support uae temple give prime minister already popular devout hindu follower bap temple win much adulation amongst bjp supporting hindu ram mandir ayodhya already garnered pethiyagoda said may however win vote south much india gulf workforce hail sends remittance bjp weaker added could also promoted properly help improve reputation amongst muslim voter could portrayed hindumuslim friendship
"India’s main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, said Friday that its bank accounts had been frozen by federal tax authorities, just weeks before an expected nationwide election. Authorities later temporarily restored access to the accounts, the party said, but not before the move drew widespread criticism from the Congress and its allies, who accused the government of conducting an attack on democracy. Congress Treasurer Ajay Maken told a news conference the accounts had been frozen after an investigation of the party’s income tax returns for the 2018-19 financial year. He added that the Income Tax Department had issued a payment demand for 2.1 billion rupees ($25.3 million) in connection to the ongoing probe. “The Congress party’s bank accounts haven’t been frozen. It’s the democracy that has been frozen,” Maken said. “Will there be only a one party system in this country?” Later on Friday, an income tex tribunal granted the party temporary access to its accounts ahead of a hearing Wednesday, lawyer and Congress lawmaker Vivek Tankha confirmed to CNN. CNN has reached out to India’s Income Tax Department and Finance Ministry, and multiple leaders within the Congress party for further comment. On Friday, Congress supporters gathered in Delhi’s iconic Jantar Mantar area to protest the action, as party chief Mallikarjun Kharge called on the judiciary to “save the multi-party system in this country and protect India’s Democracy.” Allies of the Congress party have repeatedly claimed democracy is being stifled in India, with Friday’s case the latest in a series of investigations targeting prominent opponents of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Former Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the scion of a political dynasty that produced three prime ministers, was last year disqualified as a lawmaker, and handed a two-year jail sentence for defamation, in a ruling his supporters say was politically motivated. Gandhi was later reinstated as a lawmaker following an intervention from India’s Supreme Court. Gandhi on Friday said his party will “fight tooth and nail” to protect India’s democracy. “We have never bowed down before dictatorship, nor will we ever bow down,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The Congress party, a once formidable force in Indian politics, has been languishing in the polls since Modi rose to power a decade ago with the promise of economic growth and a prosperous society for all. The Congress Party attempted to form an alliance of opposition groups in a bid to unseat Modi’s BJP in the upcoming election. But that alliance is already starting to see cracks emerge as support for the BJP surges, just weeks before an estimated 900 million Indians are expected to head to the polls. Often called the world’s largest experiment in democracy, the Indian election comes at a crucial time for the country, as it gains prominence on the world stage with Modi presenting himself as a statesman who is cementing the South Asian nation as a modern superpower. But tensions are running high at home, with minorities feeling sidelined under the BJP’s majoritarian Hindu nationalist policies. In its most recent gauge of voter sentiment, the Congress Party lost three out of four regional votes in key state elections in December, giving a boost to Modi and his BJP. This is a developing story.

"Disney is joining forces with Asia’s richest man to create a new media giant in India that says it will reach a domestic audience of more than 750 million people. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Disney have combined their digital streaming platforms and 100 TV channels in the country in a joint venture worth about $8.5 billion, the companies said in a statement Wednesday. Talk of a potential deal has been swirling for some time, as Disney has struggled to take advantage of the opportunity presented by a nation of more than 1 billion people where English is widely spoken. The company is also facing a multitude of problems back home. Disney (DIS) made a major push into the country in 2019, when it acquired most of 21st Century Fox, including its vast Star India network. Reliance will own just over 63% stake in the merged entity — 16.3% directly and 46.8% through Viacom18 in which it has a controlling stake — while Disney will hold the rest. “This is a landmark agreement that heralds a new era in the Indian entertainment industry,” said Mukesh Ambani, whose sprawling business empire is worth more than $236 billion and spans retail, technology and renewable energy. Ambani’s wife Nita M. Ambani will be the chairperson of the joint venture, which combines Disney’s “acclaimed films and shows” with Viacom18’s “renowned productions and sports offerings,” the companies said, adding that the venture would also cater to the Indian diaspora across the world. “India is the world’s most populous market, and we are excited for the opportunities that this joint venture will provide to create long-term value for the company,” said Disney CEO Bob Iger. Disney has faced multiple challenges in India, which boasts a vibrant media and entertainment sector. The House of Mouse was hit particularly hard in 2022 after it lost the digital rights to stream the hugely popular Indian Premier League cricket matches to Ambani’s conglomerate. Disney’s streaming app in India, Hotstar, has shed millions of subscribers since then and suffered another blow last March when it stopped streaming HBO content. Weeks later, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), the parent company of both HBO and CNN, moved its content to Ambani’s JioCinema, taking Indian viewers of hit shows such as “Game of Thrones” and “Succession” along with them. In its latest financial year ending in September, Disney earned revenue of just 66 cents on average per Hotstar subscriber — down from 88 cents in 2022 and compared with $5.93 for a non-US subscriber to Disney+, its main streaming service, according to its annual report. Hotstar subscriber numbers plunged 39% to 37.6 million over the latest financial year. On an earnings call in November, Iger said Disney’s TV business was doing well in India but that other parts of its business in the country were struggling. “We have an opportunity to strengthen our hand,” he said at the time. “We’d like to stay in the (Indian) market.” The deal with one of India’s richest conglomerates allows Disney to achieve those goals, according to analysts. “The merger … creates a powerful entity poised to enhance scale, profitability, and competitiveness in a converged TV and streaming video landscape,” said Mihir Shah, vice president of research firm Media Partners Asia.

"Just a few months ago, Nita Ambani stepped away from frontline business to focus on philanthropy. Now, the wife of Asia’s richest man is back with the biggest job in the ferociously competitive world of India media. She will be the chairperson of the $8.5 billion behemoth that will be formed through the merger of Disney’s (DIS) media interests in India and those of Reliance Industries, the business empire controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani. The 60-year-old’s new position comes less than two years after her husband set a succession plan in motion for the $236 billion conglomerate, which spans retail, technology and renewable energy. He plans to hand the empire to their three children. Nita Ambani will not be steering the media giant alone. Uday Shankar, former president of Disney’s Asia Pacific unit, will be the vice chairperson of the joint venture and provide “strategic guidance,” the companies said in a statement Wednesday. The Disney-Reliance deal is expected to be completed by late 2024 or early 2025, provided regulators and shareholders grant their approval. Nita Ambani first stepped into the business limelight 10 years ago, becoming the first woman director on the board of Reliance Industries. That appointment, made months after regulators urged listed Indian companies to improve gender diversity in boardrooms, was criticized by some analysts as tokenism. She resigned from the board last August to “devote her energies and time” to the Reliance Foundation, which focusses on philanthropic initiatives of the group, the company said in a statement at the time. Described as an “educationist, philanthropist, businesswoman” by the group, Ambani’s wife already has extensive experience in promoting sports and arts in the country. She is the owner of Mumbai Indians, a cricket team in the hugely popular Indian Premier League (IPL). Sport will be key to the success of the new media venture. Disney India had been facing multiple challenges before the merger was announced. It was hit particularly hard in 2022 when it lost the digital rights to stream the IPL cricket matches to Reliance, resulting in the loss of millions of subscribers. Trained in the Indian classical dance form of Bharatnatyam, she founded The Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre in Mumbai last year, which brought India its first major Broadway show, The Sound of Music, in May 2023. Married to Mukesh Ambani since 1985, she is also a member of the International Olympic Committee and an honorary trustee of the Board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Their three children — a daughter Isha, and two sons, Anant and Akash — have also been playing bigger roles at the family business, even though Mukesh Ambani insisted in 2022, when laying out the succession plan, that he has no intention of retiring any time soon. “I have never differentiated between Isha and Akash and Anant. Whatever my boys could do, my daughter could do too,” Nita Ambani said last year in a rare TV interview, when asked about promoting women in corporate India. “All our young girls are breaking, shattering glass ceilings, so give them the opportunity and they will shine,” she said, adding that equal pay is a “necessity” in the corporate world. The representation of women in Indian boardrooms has improved significantly in the last decade. Nearly 95% of the top 500 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange — had one female board member in 2022, up from 69% in 2017, according to a report by consultancy EY. “However, less than 5% of companies have female chairpersons, so there is still room for improvement,” EY added in the report, published in 2022. With her new job title, Nita Ambani has become the most powerful woman in Indian media and entertainment sector, which is worth over $25 billion and growing rapidly. Reliance will own just over 63% stake in the merged entity — 16.3% directly and 46.8% through Viacom18 in which it has a controlling stake — with Disney holding the rest.

"Charter jets for tycoons and celebrities, a performance by Rihanna and directions to don “jungle fever” outfits when visiting an animal rescue center — that’s how billionaire Mukesh Ambani is kickstarting big fat Indian wedding celebrations for his son. The head of Indian conglomerate Reliance and Asia’s richest man with a net worth of $114 billion according to Forbes, Ambani is known for never doing a party by halves. The occasion of the moment that has India transfixed is a three-day pre-wedding jamboree for his youngest son Anant Ambani, 28, who is set to marry his long-time girlfriend Radhika Merchant, 29. It begins Friday, will entertain 1,200 guests and takes place in a township in Jamnagar near Reliance’s main oil refinery in the western state of Gujarat. The wedding itself does not take place until July and festivities de facto began on Wednesday when Anant and his bride-to-be hosted a communal dinner for local villagers that served 51,000. In addition to pop and R&B superstar Rihanna, US magician David Blaine will perform and there will also be traditional ceremonies in a temple complex. Anant’s pre-wedding bash is likely to be attended by Bill Gates, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, fellow Indian billionaires Gautam Adani and Kumar Mangalam Birla, as well as many cricketers and Bollywood film stars such as Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the plans who declined to be identified. Also likely to attend is Bob Iger, CEO of Disney, which announced a $8.5 billion merger of its India media assets with Reliance’s on Wednesday. Anant is a director at Reliance’s new energy business and one of Ambani’s three children who are the heirs to his empire. Merchant is a director at India’s Encore Healthcare. Ambani also made headlines with his daughter Isha’s wedding in 2018 which was described by some as a mini-Davos summit. Former U.S. Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were among those who hit the dance floor with Bollywood stars back then. Guests to Anant Ambani’s celebrations are set to savor 500 dishes created by around 100 chefs. They will be pampered — hair styling, makeup artists and Indian wear drapists are available but only on a “first come, first serve basis,” according to a planning document provided to invitees and seen by Reuters. They will visit a rescue center that Reliance says is home to more than 2,000 animals and has one of the world’s largest elephant hospitals. The dress code is “jungle fever” with guests advised to wear animal print clothing or Hawaiian shirts.

"Police in eastern India have arrested three men for the alleged gang rape of a foreign tourist and assault of her husband, as they hunt for four more suspects in a case that highlights the country’s decades-long struggle to curb sexual violence against women. The couple, who had been traveling by motorcycle from the state of West Bengal to neighboring Nepal, were found late Friday by police officers on patrol, said Pitambar Singh Kherwar, superintendent of Dumka district police in Jharkhand state. They were taken to hospital, where the woman told the doctor she had been raped, he said. Police know the identities of the wanted suspects and have formed a special investigative team, Kherwar said. It is unclear whether the three arrested suspects have legal representation. CNN is not naming the female victim, in accordance with Indian law that prevents the naming of victims of sexual violence. Police have not disclosed the names or nationalities of the couple. The arrests come after a travel vlogger couple on Saturday posted on their Instagram account that they had “knives (held) to our throats,” during an attack in India. The woman had been raped and brought to the hospital for DNA testing, they said. The couple posts in Spanish, and the woman says on her Instagram page that she is Brazilian. On their Instagram story, the woman showed bruises on her face, saying, “This is what my face looks like, but it isn’t what hurts the most. I thought I was going to die.” In a follow-up post Sunday, the couple thanked their followers for their support, saying they are doing well and that “the police is doing everything possible to catch” the remaining suspects. CNN has reached out to the couple for comment. India’s National Commission for Women (NCW) condemned the alleged attack. NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma has spoken to the victim and extended all required assistance, the organization posted on social platform X on Saturday. Jharkhand minister Mithilesh Kumar Thakur called the alleged assault a “condemnable incident.” “If a crime has been committed, the culprits will not be spared,” he said on Saturday. India has struggled for years to tackle high rates of violence against women, with a number of high-profile rape cases involving foreign visitors drawing international attention to the issue. In 2018, A British woman was allegedly raped while walking to her hotel in the western state of Goa, a popular tourist destination; two years earlier, an American woman was allegedly drugged and raped by a group of men in her five-star hotel room in New Delhi. And in 2013, six men were sentenced to life in prison for the gang rape of a Swiss tourist. According to India’s National Crime Records Bureau, a total of 31,516 rape cases were recorded in 2022, an average of 86 cases per day. And experts warn that the number of cases recorded are just a small fraction of what may be the real number, in a deeply patriarchal country where shame and stigma surround rape victims and their families. Under India’s current laws it is still not a crime for a man to force sex or sexual acts on his wife, as long as she is over 18. Perhaps India’s most infamous case of recent years was the 2012 gang-rape of a medical student who was beaten, tortured and left to die following a brutal attack on a public bus in New Delhi. The case and ensuing nationwide protests drew international media scrutiny – and prompted authorities to enact legal reforms. The rape law was amended in 2013 to broaden the definition of the crime and set strict punishments not only for rape but also for sexual assault, voyeurism, and stalking. Despite these changes, rape cases remain prevalent in the country – with victims and advocates saying the government is still not doing enough to protect women and punish attackers.",negative,police eastern india arrested three men alleged gang rape foreign tourist assault husband hunt four suspect case highlight country decadeslong struggle curb sexual violence woman couple traveling motorcycle state west bengal neighboring nepal found late friday police officer patrol said pitambar singh kherwar superintendent dumka district police jharkhand state taken hospital woman told doctor raped said police know identity wanted suspect formed special investigative team kherwar said unclear whether three arrested suspect legal representation cnn naming female victim accordance indian law prevents naming victim sexual violence police disclosed name nationality couple arrest come travel vlogger couple saturday posted instagram account knife held throat attack india woman raped brought hospital dna testing said couple post spanish woman say instagram page brazilian instagram story woman showed bruise face saying face look like isnt hurt thought going die followup post sunday couple thanked follower support saying well police everything possible catch remaining suspect cnn reached couple comment india national commission woman ncw condemned alleged attack ncw chairperson rekha sharma spoken victim extended required assistance organization posted social platform x saturday jharkhand minister mithilesh kumar thakur called alleged assault condemnable incident crime committed culprit spared said saturday india struggled year tackle high rate violence woman number highprofile rape case involving foreign visitor drawing international attention issue british woman allegedly raped walking hotel western state goa popular tourist destination two year earlier american woman allegedly drugged raped group men fivestar hotel room new delhi six men sentenced life prison gang rape swiss tourist according india national crime record bureau total rape case recorded average case per day expert warn number case recorded small fraction may real number deeply patriarchal country shame stigma surround rape victim family india current law still crime man force sex sexual act wife long perhaps india infamous case recent year gangrape medical student beaten tortured left die following brutal attack public bus new delhi case ensuing nationwide protest drew international medium scrutiny prompted authority enact legal reform rape law amended broaden definition crime set strict punishment rape also sexual assault voyeurism stalking despite change rape case remain prevalent country victim advocate saying government still enough protect woman punish attacker
"In a line-up of India’s sporting heroes, most of whom have gained celebrity status through cricket, Neeraj Chopra is an anomaly. In fact, the champion javelin thrower has barely bowled a ball or swung a bat since his childhood, even though he can’t help but notice the similarities between his discipline and his country’s favorite past-time. “I feel that in India, it’s natural, a fast arm,” Chopra tells CNN Sport. “And it’s a basic thing in javelin throwing – if you have a fast arm, you can throw far.” The South Asian country is home to more than 125 million cricket fans, according to a 2022 report by Ormax Media, but Chopra’s ability to hurl a javelin close to 300 feet has earned him a sizeable following in his own right. His stardom has only grown with each passing success. After winning Olympic gold in Tokyo three years ago – the first Asian athlete to do so in the javelin – Chopra was crowned world champion in Budapest last year, becoming the first Indian to win a world title in a track and field event of any kind. It perhaps comes as no surprise, given his historic career to date, that the understated 26-year-old has proven a hit back home. “So many people from my country, they support me, they watch my competitions,” says Chopra. “Even if I’m competing in the Diamond League, they stay awake until one or two at night and they watch my competition. It’s really amazing that people support athletics.” Such is his popularity that August 7 is now celebrated as National Javelin Day in India, the anniversary of Chopra winning his Olympic gold medal in Tokyo. Prior to Chopra, India had practically no history in track and field, winning most of its Olympic medals in field hockey and wrestling. But now there is genuine excitement each time the superstar athlete competes, and as he jockeys up a runway with a quivering javelin in hand, a nation holds its breath. “You ask anybody in India who their favorite sportsperson is at the moment, unanimously the answer will be Neeraj Chopra – despite the fact that athletics is not a popular sport,” veteran journalist Norris Pritam, who last year published a book on Chopra’s life and career, tells CNN Sport. “On the other hand, cricket is a popular sport, a common man’s sport. People talk, breathe, eat cricket, it’s kind of a religion. But still, Neeraj Chopra is the best sportsperson. He’s a hero. He’s absolutely a hero in India.” Growing up in the rural village of Khandra in the northern state of Haryana, Chopra played cricket and volleyball – another sport in which a fast arm can be a useful weapon – in his pre-teen years. He was overweight as a child – carrying what he has recently described as “excess flab” – and was frequently told that sport wasn’t for him. But that all changed as soon as he caught sight of a javelin shimmering through the sky at an athletics stadium in the nearby city of Panipat. “It was a very random thing for me because there was no background in my family or my whole village – nobody was an athlete, nobody knows about javelin throwing,” says Chopra. “When I go to the stadium … I really like how the javelin flies and how it’s going like fish swimming in the sea. I really like this thing, and even now when I throw, I always enjoy how the javelin flies.” This was in 2011, and it was enough for the then-13-year-old Chopra to be inspired to try the sport for himself. His father and uncles, part of a family of farmers, pooled together enough money to buy a steel javelin, and it was in a plowing field near the family home that Chopra attempted some of his first throws. A seed was soon sown, and the fledgling athlete would spend hour after hour launching throw after throw. “He started without any training, without any family background, without any sort of formal school where there could be a javelin thrower,” says Pritam. “In fact, the school in the village had no culture for sport, no grounds for sport.” Before he had any proper coaching, Chopra relied on YouTube videos to hone his technique. His talent soon became evident, and after moving to a sports academy in the city of Panchkula, his arm speed got faster, his throws further, and international competitions quickly followed. Today, Chopra’s resumé is long and impressive, boasting two Asian Games titles and a Commonwealth Games gold medal on top of his world and Olympic triumphs. He is the favorite to defend his title at the Paris Olympics, which get underway on July 26, though he’s not allowing thoughts of further success to enter his head at this stage. “My main focus is to stay healthy,” says Chopra, “but I’m not taking the pressure of winning a gold medal again. I’ll just do my training with 100% of my heart and I’ll give my best … That day will decide who will win a medal.” Performing under pressure, particularly with such a huge fanbase back home in India, has been a common theme of Chopra’s career. His popularity doesn’t faze him, instead feeding his self-belief right down to his final throw. “This is not pressure for me,” he adds. “I feel really good when people are talking about me and they say, ‘Okay, Neeraj can win this medal, Neeraj can throw far.’ I always take these things positively.” Having won his first world title – previously, the most obvious gap in his trophy cabinet – last year, Chopra now wants to throw beyond 90 meters (about 295 feet), which he describes as a “magical mark” in javelin throwing. Only 24 men in history have ever thrown further than 90 meters, but Chopra’s personal best is only six centimeters (about 2.4 inches) shy of that distance; it is more a matter of when, rather than if, he can tick off that goal. In India, however, he has nothing more to prove, his status as a national hero already secured. “Everybody knows Neeraj,” says Pritam, “because his posters are there, his billboards are there, he’s in books and magazines and everything. “You put on the TV and you find Neeraj there talking; he’s a brand ambassador to hundreds of things – sanitation, education, selling products on television. He is a moving billboard, one can say now.” And if he wins a second gold medal at the Olympics? “He will be treated like God,” adds Pritam. Chopra, rarely overwhelmed by such adulation, is taking public recognition in his stride. He nearly always trains and competes outside of India, but when he is back home, he is often struck by his far-reaching influence. “When people meet me, they always say, ‘Our son or our daughter will also start javelin or athletics, and they can also win a medal for India,’” says Chopra. “This is a good thing for me.”",positive,lineup india sporting hero gained celebrity status cricket neeraj chopra anomaly fact champion javelin thrower barely bowled ball swung bat since childhood even though cant help notice similarity discipline country favorite pasttime feel india natural fast arm chopra tell cnn sport basic thing javelin throwing fast arm throw far south asian country home million cricket fan according report ormax medium chopras ability hurl javelin close foot earned sizeable following right stardom grown passing success winning olympic gold tokyo three year ago first asian athlete javelin chopra crowned world champion budapest last year becoming first indian win world title track field event kind perhaps come surprise given historic career date understated yearold proven hit back home many people country support watch competition say chopra even im competing diamond league stay awake one two night watch competition really amazing people support athletics popularity august celebrated national javelin day india anniversary chopra winning olympic gold medal tokyo prior chopra india practically history track field winning olympic medal field hockey wrestling genuine excitement time superstar athlete competes jockey runway quivering javelin hand nation hold breath ask anybody india favorite sportsperson moment unanimously answer neeraj chopra despite fact athletics popular sport veteran journalist norris pritam last year published book chopras life career tell cnn sport hand cricket popular sport common man sport people talk breathe eat cricket kind religion still neeraj chopra best sportsperson he hero he absolutely hero india growing rural village khandra northern state haryana chopra played cricket volleyball another sport fast arm useful weapon preteen year overweight child carrying recently described excess flab frequently told sport wasnt changed soon caught sight javelin shimmering sky athletics stadium nearby city panipat random thing background family whole village nobody athlete nobody know javelin throwing say chopra go stadium really like javelin fly going like fish swimming sea really like thing even throw always enjoy javelin fly enough thenyearold chopra inspired try sport father uncle part family farmer pooled together enough money buy steel javelin plowing field near family home chopra attempted first throw seed soon sown fledgling athlete would spend hour hour launching throw throw started without training without family background without sort formal school could javelin thrower say pritam fact school village culture sport ground sport proper coaching chopra relied youtube video hone technique talent soon became evident moving sport academy city panchkula arm speed got faster throw international competition quickly followed today chopras resum long impressive boasting two asian game title commonwealth game gold medal top world olympic triumph favorite defend title paris olympics get underway july though he allowing thought success enter head stage main focus stay healthy say chopra im taking pressure winning gold medal ill training heart ill give best day decide win medal performing pressure particularly huge fanbase back home india common theme chopras career popularity doesnt faze instead feeding selfbelief right final throw pressure add feel really good people talking say okay neeraj win medal neeraj throw far always take thing positively first world title previously obvious gap trophy cabinet last year chopra want throw beyond meter foot describes magical mark javelin throwing men history ever thrown meter chopras personal best six centimeter inch shy distance matter rather tick goal india however nothing prove status national hero already secured everybody know neeraj say pritam poster billboard he book magazine everything put tv find neeraj talking he brand ambassador hundred thing sanitation education selling product television moving billboard one say win second gold medal olympics treated like god add pritam chopra rarely overwhelmed adulation taking public recognition stride nearly always train competes outside india back home often struck farreaching influence people meet always say son daughter also start javelin athletics also win medal india say chopra good thing
"India said Monday it had joined the world’s top nuclear powers by mastering the ability to put multiple warheads atop a single intercontinental ballistic missile. The successful test of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) technology on the indigenously developed Agni-V ICBM puts India in a club that includes the United States, Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom. Neighboring Pakistan has also claimed to have MIRV technology, but experts say the claim is unverified. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the country’s scientists for the development, one of a series announced by his government months before a national election. The prime minister is seeking a rare third consecutive term in power. “Proud of our DRDO [Defence Research and Development Organisation] scientists for Mission Divyastra, the first flight test of indigenously developed Agni-5 missile with Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Vehicle (MIRV) technology,” Modi said X on Monday. Indian scientists conducted the test at a facility on Abdul Kalam Island in the Bay of Bengal, off India’s northeast coast, the Defense Ministry said in a statement. “Various Telemetry and radar stations tracked and monitored multiple re-entry vehicles. The Mission accomplished the designed parameters,” the statement said.India did not give an exact number of reentry vehicles released during the Agni-V test, but MIRVed missiles can carry a dozen or possibly more MIRV warheads. Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh congratulated scientists and the team behind the test. “India is proud of them,” he wrote on X. Home Minister Amit Shah called it a “a momentous day for our nation,” adding that the technology will “further accelerate” Modi’s vision of a “self-reliant Bharat (India).” Each warhead, once released in space from the rocket that missile that carried it aloft, can be programmed to hit separate targets up to 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) apart, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-proliferation. Overall, the Agni-V missile has a range of more than 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles), according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies Missile Defense Project. That puts India rivals like China and Pakistan well within range of the weapon. MIRV technology is not new. The United States first deployed it in 1970 with the Minuteman III ICBM, according to the National Museum of the US Air Force. The Minuteman III was designed to carry three warheads, but the US missiles now only carry one to comply with arms control treaties with Russia. MIRVed missiles present a problem for ballistic missile defenses because interceptor missiles have to contend with a number of warheads traveling to targets hundreds of miles apart. They are also considered “destabilizing” weapons, according to experts, as they present tempting first-strike targets. “This creates a ‘use them or lose them’ scenario—an incentive to strike first in a time of crisis. Otherwise, a first strike attack that destroyed a country’s MIRVed missiles would disproportionately damage that country’s ability to retaliate,” according to a website posting from the Union of Concerned Scientists. India’s announcement of MIRV capability comes as rival China has been expanding its nuclear forces in a similar fashion. The US Defense Department’s 2023 report to Congress on China’s military said Beijing “is developing new ICBMs that will significantly improve its nuclear-capable missile forces and will require increased nuclear warhead production, partially due to the introduction of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) capabilities.” China and India share a disputed border in the Himalayas, where deadly clashes have occurred as recently as 2020.",positive,india said monday joined world top nuclear power mastering ability put multiple warhead atop single intercontinental ballistic missile successful test multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle mirv technology indigenously developed agniv icbm put india club includes united state russia china france united kingdom neighboring pakistan also claimed mirv technology expert say claim unverified indian prime minister narendra modi praised country scientist development one series announced government month national election prime minister seeking rare third consecutive term power proud drdo defence research development organisation scientist mission divyastra first flight test indigenously developed agni missile multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle mirv technology modi said x monday indian scientist conducted test facility abdul kalam island bay bengal india northeast coast defense ministry said statement various telemetry radar station tracked monitored multiple reentry vehicle mission accomplished designed parameter statement saidindia give exact number reentry vehicle released agniv test mirved missile carry dozen possibly mirv warhead indian defense minister rajnath singh congratulated scientist team behind test india proud wrote x home minister amit shah called momentous day nation adding technology accelerate modis vision selfreliant bharat india warhead released space rocket missile carried aloft programmed hit separate target kilometer mile apart according center arm control nonproliferation overall agniv missile range kilometer mile according center strategic international study missile defense project put india rival like china pakistan well within range weapon mirv technology new united state first deployed minuteman iii icbm according national museum u air force minuteman iii designed carry three warhead u missile carry one comply arm control treaty russia mirved missile present problem ballistic missile defense interceptor missile contend number warhead traveling target hundred mile apart also considered destabilizing weapon according expert present tempting firststrike target creates use lose scenarioan incentive strike first time crisis otherwise first strike attack destroyed country mirved missile would disproportionately damage country ability retaliate according website posting union concerned scientist india announcement mirv capability come rival china expanding nuclear force similar fashion u defense department report congress china military said beijing developing new icbm significantly improve nuclearcapable missile force require increased nuclear warhead production partially due introduction multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle mirv capability china india share disputed border himalaya deadly clash occurred recently
"British singer Ed Sheeran wowed the stage in Mumbai with Diljit Dosanjh over the weekend as the pair sang a rendition of the Indian artist’s hit track “Lover” in Punjabi, a duet that promptly lit up India’s social media. Both artists posted videos of their performances on Instagram, with huge cheers from the crowd as Sheeran invited his singing partner onto the stage. “Got to bring out @diljitdosanjh tonight in Mumbai and sing in Punjabi for the first time. I’ve had such an incredible time in India, more to come!” Sheeran wrote in a post. Singer and actor Dosanjh, 40, is one of the biggest South Asian artists worldwide and has played a major role in putting Punjabi music on the map internationally. He made history in 2023 as the first Punjabi artist to perform at Coachella. Over the past 15 years, Sheeran has gone from self-releasing his EPs and playing small bars in London to one of modern pop’s best-selling song writers. He is in the middle of his mammoth two-and-a half-year long global “Mathematics” tour. More than 50,000 concertgoers were packed into the Mahalaxmi Racecourse to see Dosanjh’s surprise appearance, as the Indian star hyped up the audience and Sheeran rocked on an acoustic guitar, singing parts of the chorus. “We had no idea Diljit was going to be here, it felt like moon had descended,” a fan said in a video recap posted by the Indian star. “I am still processing what just happened here, I am never going to forget this night,” another concertgoer said. Spotify India commented on a video posted by Sheeran saying, “we see fire on that stage,” in reference to one of the British star’s hits. Fans and Indian celebrities on social media praised Dosanjh for getting Sheeran to sing in an Indian language. Bollywood actor Varun Dhawan called it “global domination,” in a comment on Dosanjh’s Instagram video. “I was standing in the audience shrieking like a fan girl. This was the multiverse event nobody expected,” commented comedian Sahil Bulla. “Hats off to Diljit,” wrote another user. “This man has literally blown-up Punjabi music scene making other artists [sing] in Punjabi waiting for their collab.” Dosanjh has collaborated with other English-speaking singers and last year released bilingual track “Hass Hass” with Sia, the Australia-born artist behind “Chandelier” and “Elastic Heart.” And fans are hoping for more international crossovers with the Indian artist, with one person commenting “first Sia, now Ed, Diljit gonna make everyone sing in Punjabi.” India has 23 official languages, including English, and is home to hundreds of other mother tongues. Punjabi is native to the Punjab region of India, as well as neighboring Pakistan. Around the world, there are over 100 million speakers of Punjabi across the South Asian subcontinent and diaspora communities. During the concert, Sheeran also thanked fans for braving hours of traffic to reach the event. Roads leading to the sprawling 225-acre venue – equivalent to roughly 170 American football fields – were jammed with cars some five hours before the gig began at 7:15 p.m. on Saturday, according to CNN staff who attended. The traffic was so bad that some fans left their cars and walked the final 2-kilometer (1.2 mile) stretch to the entrances. “I know India is a big place but everyone here at the concert is not necessarily from Mumbai. People have traveled a long way to be here today. People got on trains, planes, they drove, and got kids. I know a lot goes into you spending your Saturday night with me,” Sheeran said. “This is just the beginning,” he added, and made a promise that he would return to India.",neutral,british singer ed sheeran wowed stage mumbai diljit dosanjh weekend pair sang rendition indian artist hit track lover punjabi duet promptly lit india social medium artist posted video performance instagram huge cheer crowd sheeran invited singing partner onto stage got bring diljitdosanjh tonight mumbai sing punjabi first time ive incredible time india come sheeran wrote post singer actor dosanjh one biggest south asian artist worldwide played major role putting punjabi music map internationally made history first punjabi artist perform coachella past year sheeran gone selfreleasing eps playing small bar london one modern pop bestselling song writer middle mammoth twoanda halfyear long global mathematics tour concertgoers packed mahalaxmi racecourse see dosanjhs surprise appearance indian star hyped audience sheeran rocked acoustic guitar singing part chorus idea diljit going felt like moon descended fan said video recap posted indian star still processing happened never going forget night another concertgoer said spotify india commented video posted sheeran saying see fire stage reference one british star hit fan indian celebrity social medium praised dosanjh getting sheeran sing indian language bollywood actor varun dhawan called global domination comment dosanjhs instagram video standing audience shrieking like fan girl multiverse event nobody expected commented comedian sahil bulla hat diljit wrote another user man literally blownup punjabi music scene making artist sing punjabi waiting collab dosanjh collaborated englishspeaking singer last year released bilingual track ha ha sia australiaborn artist behind chandelier elastic heart fan hoping international crossover indian artist one person commenting first sia ed diljit gon na make everyone sing punjabi india official language including english home hundred mother tongue punjabi native punjab region india well neighboring pakistan around world million speaker punjabi across south asian subcontinent diaspora community concert sheeran also thanked fan braving hour traffic reach event road leading sprawling acre venue equivalent roughly american football field jammed car five hour gig began pm saturday according cnn staff attended traffic bad fan left car walked final kilometer mile stretch entrance know india big place everyone concert necessarily mumbai people traveled long way today people got train plane drove got kid know lot go spending saturday night sheeran said beginning added made promise would return india
"A popular food delivery app in India has sparked controversy, and an abrupt retreat, after launching an initiative to attract vegetarian customers. Earlier this week, Zomato announced plans to introduce a curation of restaurants that serve only “pure vegetarian food.” This list “will exclude all restaurants which serve any non-veg food item,” the company’s founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal said on X on Tuesday. “Non-veg,” short for “non-vegetarian,” refers to any food that contains meat, poultry or seafood. “India has the largest percentage of vegetarians in the world,” Goyal wrote on X, adding that many of them are “very particular” about how their food is cooked and handled. In order to further cater to these strict dietary preferences, their food would be delivered by a “dedicated pure veg fleet.” These riders would wear new green uniforms, as opposed to the red ones worn by the rest of the delivery workers, the company said. “This means that a non-veg meal, or even a veg meal served by a non-veg restaurant will never go inside the green delivery box meant for our pure veg fleet,” Goyal added. Many of the most widely followed religions in the world’s most populous country require adherence to strict dietary laws. Jains and many Hindus stick to a vegetarian diet, following the principle of “ahimsa,” or non-violence and respect for all life. Almost four in 10 Indian adults say they are vegetarian, according to the Pew Research Center. Some of these dietary laws are so deeply entrenched that there have even been instances of property developers not selling apartments to meat eaters. Restrictions on cow slaughter have become politically contentious in India in recent years, as many among the country’s majority Hindu population consider the animal to be sacred. While Goyal emphasized the new plans are not meant to “alienate any religious, or political preference,” the company has received a huge backlash on social media. Some users criticized the move as “casteist,” as many Hindus from dominant castes tend to be vegetarian, while many people from marginalized castes are not. India’s caste system was officially abolished in 1950, but the 2,000-year-old social hierarchy imposed on people by birth still exists in many aspects of life. The caste system categorizes Hindus at birth, defining their place in society, what jobs they can do and who they can marry. Zomato’s move was also slammed as risky for both meat eaters and delivery staff. “Unsafe and illogical,” wrote one user on X. “This strengthens an artificial divide between veg-non-veg eaters. Enables … colonies to identify and persecute citizens on basis of food preference.” Following the outcry, Zomato has rolled back plans to dress riders delivering vegetarian food in green. “All our riders — both our regular fleet, and our fleet for vegetarians, will wear the colour red,” Goyal said on Wednesday. “This will ensure that our red uniform delivery partners are not incorrectly associated with non-veg food, and blocked by [housing] societies … our riders’ physical safety is of paramount importance to us,” he said. “We now realise that even some of our customers could get into trouble with their landlords, and that would not be a nice thing if that happened because of us,” he added.",neutral,popular food delivery app india sparked controversy abrupt retreat launching initiative attract vegetarian customer earlier week zomato announced plan introduce curation restaurant serve pure vegetarian food list exclude restaurant serve nonveg food item company founder ceo deepinder goyal said x tuesday nonveg short nonvegetarian refers food contains meat poultry seafood india largest percentage vegetarian world goyal wrote x adding many particular food cooked handled order cater strict dietary preference food would delivered dedicated pure veg fleet rider would wear new green uniform opposed red one worn rest delivery worker company said mean nonveg meal even veg meal served nonveg restaurant never go inside green delivery box meant pure veg fleet goyal added many widely followed religion world populous country require adherence strict dietary law jains many hindu stick vegetarian diet following principle ahimsa nonviolence respect life almost four indian adult say vegetarian according pew research center dietary law deeply entrenched even instance property developer selling apartment meat eater restriction cow slaughter become politically contentious india recent year many among country majority hindu population consider animal sacred goyal emphasized new plan meant alienate religious political preference company received huge backlash social medium user criticized move casteist many hindu dominant caste tend vegetarian many people marginalized caste india caste system officially abolished yearold social hierarchy imposed people birth still exists many aspect life caste system categorizes hindu birth defining place society job marry zomatos move also slammed risky meat eater delivery staff unsafe illogical wrote one user x strengthens artificial divide vegnonveg eater enables colony identify persecute citizen basis food preference following outcry zomato rolled back plan dress rider delivering vegetarian food green rider regular fleet fleet vegetarian wear colour red goyal said wednesday ensure red uniform delivery partner incorrectly associated nonveg food blocked housing society rider physical safety paramount importance u said realise even customer could get trouble landlord would nice thing happened u added
"The world’s biggest election kicks into gear next week when the first ballots are cast in India’s mammoth national polls, considered the most consequential in decades with the potential to shape the country’s future. Nearly 1 billion people are eligible to decide whether to grant Prime Minister Narendra Modi a rare third consecutive term in office and extend the 10-year rule of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Under Modi, India has become the world’s fastest growing major economy, pushing the country of 1.4 billion people to near-superpower status. But India has also become increasingly polarized along religious lines and critics say another five-year term will give Modi’s right-wing BJP a mandate to continue its policies that have transformed the country from a secular republic to a Hindu-first nation. Here’s what you need to know about the largest election in human history: India’s national elections are a giant exercise in democracy and logistics that take over a month to complete. About 968 million people are eligible to vote — more than the populations of the United States, the European Union and Russia combined. Given the size of the electorate, there isn’t a single date when everyone will vote. Instead, polling will unfold over seven phases around the country, beginning on April 19 and ending on June 1. All the votes from the country’s 28 states and eight union territories will be counted and results released on June 4. Under a multi-party, first-past-the-post system, Indians will vote to fill 543 of 545 seats in the lower house of parliament, called the Lok Sabha, with two other seats nominated by the country’s president. The party with the majority will form a government and appoint one of its winning candidates as prime minister. Modi and his BJP remain hugely popular and he is widely expected to secure another five years in power. The 73-year-old was first elected prime minister in 2014 with a roaring majority on a ticket of development and anti-corruption. He is credited with implementing welfare and social reforms, and easily secured a second term in 2019, this time on a more apparent platform of Hindu nationalism. In that election more than 67% of Indians cast their ballot — the highest voter turnout in the country’s history. The main challenger to the BJP is the Indian National Congress, which has governed the country for much of the 77 years since independence but now finds itself in the doldrums. In an effort to prevent another Modi win, the Congress formed an alliance with other opposition leaders, including major regional parties. The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, or INDIA, launched its campaign late last month on a platform of “saving democracy.” Political scion Rahul Gandhi is the face of the Congress party but other key figures include popular leader of the Aam Aadmi Party and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. There are also regional heavyweights such as the West Bengal chief minister and All India Trinamool Congress’ Mamata Banerjee and the south’s Tamil Nadu chief minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin, who will be vying to block a BJP takeover in their respective states where Modi is yet to break through. The INDIA bloc has been beset by infighting and is yet to put forward its candidate for prime minister. Analysts say it is struggling to match the kind of star quality and appeal projected by Modi. The opposition is also under pressure from what it says is a campaign by the BJP to weaken Modi’s opponents. Several prominent members of the opposition, including Delhi chief minister Kejriwal, have been arrested or investigated by state agencies in moves decried as political by their parties. The Congress had its bank accounts frozen by federal tax authorities and said it was asked to pay a further $218 million in taxes. The BJP has denied political interference. Meanwhile, another victory for Modi would cement his place as one of India’s most important and longest-serving leaders. Modi’s party and its allies are aiming to win more than 400 seats in the Lok Sabha — giving them enough votes to change India’s constitution. That figure will also improve its absolute majority secured in 2019 when the BJP won 303 seats, to the Congress party’s 52. India is the world’s largest democracy but over a decade of BJP rule, analysts say the populist Modi has tightened his grip on its democratic institutions. Minorities, especially the country’s 200 million Muslims, say they have been persecuted under the BJP’s Hindu-nationalist policies. And Modi has been accused of silencing his critics including cracking down on India’s independent media. In the annual World Press Freedom Index, India has dropped from 140th in 2014 — the year Modi came to power — to 161 out of 180 nations in last year’s list. From demolishing Islamic monuments, to renaming cities founded by ancient Muslim rulers and revising history textbooks, Modi’s rule has been a seismic shift for India, from its secular founding values to that of a Hindu-first nation. Analysts say another BJP term will push India further along this road. Modi’s supporters point to his economic record: India is poised to become a 21st-century powerhouse as its economy rapidly expands. They say his presence on the world stage — including hosting the G20 — has cemented the country as a modern global power, along with a history-making moon landing. Modi has also delivered on many of his key promises, with his crowning achievement the inauguration of the controversial Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, a Hindu temple in the holy city of Ayodhya that was built on the site of the destroyed Babri mosque. But while India’s economy is rising, the world’s most populous country has failed to generate enough jobs for the millions of young people struggling to enter the workforce. Unemployment among 20- to 24-year-olds was a staggering 44.4% at the end of 2023. Farmers have also emerged as the biggest threat to the ruling party in recent years, repeatedly taking to the streets to demand stronger protection of their economic welfare including higher fixed prices for their crops. Agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for about 55% of India’s population and farmers have previously had success strong-arming Modi into repealing unpopular agriculture policies. India’s election is believed to be the world’s most expensive, even outstripping US presidential elections. In 2019, political parties, candidates and regulatory bodies spent up to $8.6 billion, according to the Delhi-based Centre for Media Studies. This year, spending is expected to surge past that. From the high peaks of the Himalayas to the remote forests of India’s central states, votes are cast electronically across more than 1 million polling stations. Some 15 million election workers will be deployed, traveling via road, boat, camel, train and helicopter to reach every Indian voter. At 15,256 feet (4,650 meters), Tashigang, a village in the far northern state of Himachal Pradesh on the border with China, was the world’s highest polling station when its residents voted in 2022 state government elections. In 2019, more than 8,000 candidates contested the election. This year, candidates are still being announced, but more than 2,700 parties will fight it out for seats in the Lok Sabha, including six national and more than 70 state parties. Each party has a symbol allotted to them by the Election Commission that appears on the ballots — helping the dozens of parties to differentiate themselves, while making it easier for voters to make their choice in a country where around a quarter of the population is illiterate. They are everyday objects like a ceiling fan, a comb and a mango. The ruling BJP’s symbol is a lotus, while the Congress party is a raised, open-palmed hand.

"Elon Musk has postponed his planned trip to India, citing “very heavy” obligations at Tesla. The Tesla CEO was due to arrive in India next week for a visit that was expected to include a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and confirmation that Tesla will build a factory in the world’s most populous country. “Unfortunately, very heavy Tesla obligations require that the visit to India be delayed, but I do very much look forward to visiting later this year,” Musk posted on X on Saturday. Musk posted last week on X that he was “looking forward” to meeting Modi. He was also planning to meet leaders of Indian space tech startups during his visit, including Pawan Chandana, co-founder of Skyroot Aerospace, which launched India’s first privately developed rocket in 2022. Apart from Tesla (TSLA), Musk is also the boss of rocket company SpaceX and X, formerly Twitter. Currently the world’s fourth-richest man, Musk was expected to announce an investment of $2 billion to $3 billion in India, mainly for building the new Tesla factory, Reuters  and the Financial Times reported, citing anonymous sources. His trip was originally scheduled just days after India commenced the world’s largest democratic election. An estimated 960 million people in the country of 1.4 billion are eligible to vote in the poll, which started on Friday and will take more than a month to complete. Modi is widely expected to clinch a rare third consecutive five-year term as prime minister.",neutral,elon musk postponed planned trip india citing heavy obligation tesla tesla ceo due arrive india next week visit expected include meeting prime minister narendra modi confirmation tesla build factory world populous country unfortunately heavy tesla obligation require visit india delayed much look forward visiting later year musk posted x saturday musk posted last week x looking forward meeting modi also planning meet leader indian space tech startup visit including pawan chandana cofounder skyroot aerospace launched india first privately developed rocket apart tesla tsla musk also bos rocket company spacex x formerly twitter currently world fourthrichest man musk expected announce investment billion billion india mainly building new tesla factory reuters financial time reported citing anonymous source trip originally scheduled day india commenced world largest democratic election estimated million people country billion eligible vote poll started friday take month complete modi widely expected clinch rare third consecutive fiveyear term prime minister
"India is one of the world’s top spacefaring nations. It is the first Asian country to reach Mars orbit, and the fourth on the planet to take a spacecraft to the moon, landing closer to the south pole, known for its cratered terrain, than anyone else had at the time. But its private sector has played a limited role in space exploration, acting mostly as suppliers and vendors for its national space agency, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). That’s changing quickly, owing to a raft of government reforms aiming to boost private participation in the space sector. In the United States, the proliferation of private companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX have boosted Washington’s space ambitions by driving down costs. Now Indian homegrown startups like Skyroot Aerospace, which launched the country’s first private rocket in 2022, are leading the charge to commercialize India’s space sector and bolster its status as a space superpower. Inside a sleek rocket hanger in the southern city of Hyderabad, the company is preparing for lift-off of the seven-story tall Vikram-1 rocket, which will take India’s first privately launched satellites into orbit. “That’ll be a major milestone for us,” Pawan Chandana, a former ISRO scientist who co-founded Skyroot Aerospace in 2018, told CNN. “Very few companies globally are able to make it to orbit yet.” India is pushing pioneering national initiatives, including plans to have its own space station by 2035 and to put an Indian astronaut on the moon by 2040. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is currently running for his third consecutive term, has made a major push to commercialize space activity in recent years, including allowing private enterprise to take part and easing approvals for foreign investment into the space sector. Companies around the world are catapulting thousands of satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO), which extends to an altitude of about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles), to form mega-constellations: groups of small satellites that work together to beam broadband Internet to terrestrial users. According to analytics firm BryceTech, 96% of spacecraft launched in 2022 were small satellites, up from 61% in 2013. That’s driving exponential growth. The global space economy was worth $630 billion in 2023, according to a report by McKinsey & Company and the World Economic Forum, and it could grow to $1.8 trillion by 2035. It’s the small satellite market that Skyroot wants to capture, with plans to offer customized launches for satellites under 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds). Organizations’ satellites often piggyback onto “rideshare” missions. Last year, for example, one SpaceX journey — powered by its Falcon 9 rocket, which can carry 22,000 kilograms (48,500 pounds) into LEO — launched 51 small satellites into orbit for multiple companies. But there’s often a waiting period to hitch a ride, and satellites can only go where the rocket is heading. That may be disadvantageous for a satellite that wants to reach a particular orbit, to observe a certain part of the planet. The model does provides advantages. SpaceX says the cost of getting a 500-kilogram (1,100 pound) payload into LEO is about $6,000 per kilogram. “It’s really very, very competitive what SpaceX is now offering,” says Susmita Mohanty, director general of Indian think-tank Spaceport Sarabhai. Skyroot wants to offer dedicated launches for $20,000 per kilogram, which is much more expensive than SpaceX’s less bespoke service. (Chandana says that mass production and better technology may enable further cost reductions). Chandana compares SpaceX’s ridesharing missions as “a train to go to space” and Skyroot’s operations as “cabs to get into space, where we take satellites to their customized locations.” He adds: “We don’t directly compete with SpaceX, because SpaceX is into bigger vehicles and satellites … and what we are into is customized launch solutions.” Once prices drop, there will be more interest in “people wanting to choose dedicated launches without compromising on going for a rideshare mission,” he said. Customized launches might be useful for those who want to send smaller payloads aiming to reach “a diverse amount of orbits” that might not be possible to get to by ridesharing, says Kari Bingen, director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank based in the US. That could be useful for commercial companies, academic institutions or governments that are willing to pay the price, she adds. Chandana is optimistic he can make it more affordable, noting the “frugality in the DNA” of India’s space program. (The country’s Mars orbiter budget was just $74 million. Modi has pointed out that it cost less than the Hollywood sci-fi thriller “Gravity.”) Chandana adds that the company aims to build a reusable rocket eventually, a capability which has helped SpaceX reduce launch costs. India is now home to almost 200 space startups, up from just one in 2014, according to a report published by Deloitte in 2023. Over the same period, private investment into those companies topped $200 million. Skyroot has already raised $95 million, with backers like Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC. That makes it India’s most-funded space startup, according to data platform Tracxn. But the company has work to do to reach profitability. It needs to demonstrate that it can consistently reach orbit, before interest “will turn into contracts, which will help us scale,” says Chandana. Yet spots on Vikram-1 are fully booked, with a mix of domestic and international clients. As Indian space startups mature over the coming years, he expects the government to become a customer, enabling further growth. Many private space companies source income from governments, including Space X, which has raked in billions of dollars from US government contracts. India’s government allocated just under $1.6 billion to develop its space prorgram in its interim 2024 budget. By comparison, NASA received $24.9 billion for 2024. “Unless and until the government backs up the reforms with significant funding coming from India itself, it will be difficult for us to rival the development of the US market or the Chinese market,” says Mohanty. She adds that for Indian startups to play a meaningful role in the global marketplace, “they need to go beyond servicing our own space agency’s domestic mandate and start bidding for contracts.” Chandana sounds up for the challenge. “We want to become globally [one of the] top three launch companies,” he says. “My fascination for rockets has become an obsession.”",positive,india one world top spacefaring nation first asian country reach mar orbit fourth planet take spacecraft moon landing closer south pole known cratered terrain anyone else time private sector played limited role space exploration acting mostly supplier vendor national space agency indian space research organization isro thats changing quickly owing raft government reform aiming boost private participation space sector united state proliferation private company like elon musk spacex boosted washington space ambition driving cost indian homegrown startup like skyroot aerospace launched country first private rocket leading charge commercialize india space sector bolster status space superpower inside sleek rocket hanger southern city hyderabad company preparing liftoff sevenstory tall vikram rocket take india first privately launched satellite orbit thatll major milestone u pawan chandana former isro scientist cofounded skyroot aerospace told cnn company globally able make orbit yet india pushing pioneering national initiative including plan space station put indian astronaut moon meanwhile prime minister narendra modi currently running third consecutive term made major push commercialize space activity recent year including allowing private enterprise take part easing approval foreign investment space sector company around world catapulting thousand satellite low earth orbit leo extends altitude kilometer mile form megaconstellations group small satellite work together beam broadband internet terrestrial user according analytics firm brycetech spacecraft launched small satellite thats driving exponential growth global space economy worth billion according report mckinsey company world economic forum could grow trillion small satellite market skyroot want capture plan offer customized launch satellite kilogram pound organization satellite often piggyback onto rideshare mission last year example one spacex journey powered falcon rocket carry kilogram pound leo launched small satellite orbit multiple company there often waiting period hitch ride satellite go rocket heading may disadvantageous satellite want reach particular orbit observe certain part planet model provides advantage spacex say cost getting kilogram pound payload leo per kilogram really competitive spacex offering say susmita mohanty director general indian thinktank spaceport sarabhai skyroot want offer dedicated launch per kilogram much expensive spacexs le bespoke service chandana say mass production better technology may enable cost reduction chandana compare spacexs ridesharing mission train go space skyroots operation cab get space take satellite customized location add dont directly compete spacex spacex bigger vehicle satellite customized launch solution price drop interest people wanting choose dedicated launch without compromising going rideshare mission said customized launch might useful want send smaller payload aiming reach diverse amount orbit might possible get ridesharing say kari bingen director aerospace security project center strategic international study thinktank based u could useful commercial company academic institution government willing pay price add chandana optimistic make affordable noting frugality dna india space program country mar orbiter budget million modi pointed cost le hollywood scifi thriller gravity chandana add company aim build reusable rocket eventually capability helped spacex reduce launch cost india home almost space startup one according report published deloitte period private investment company topped million skyroot already raised million backer like singapore sovereign wealth fund gic make india mostfunded space startup according data platform tracxn company work reach profitability need demonstrate consistently reach orbit interest turn contract help u scale say chandana yet spot vikram fully booked mix domestic international client indian space startup mature coming year expects government become customer enabling growth many private space company source income government including space x raked billion dollar u government contract india government allocated billion develop space prorgram interim budget comparison nasa received billion unless government back reform significant funding coming india difficult u rival development u market chinese market say mohanty add indian startup play meaningful role global marketplace need go beyond servicing space agency domestic mandate start bidding contract chandana sound challenge want become globally one top three launch company say fascination rocket become obsession
