nytimes,Man Accused in Plot to Assassinate Sikh Separatist Pleads Not Guilty,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/nyregion/nikhil-gupta-india-assassination-plot.html,"An Indian man pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of orchestrating a failed assassination plot against a Sikh separatist in New York, a plan that prosecutors say he devised on behalf of an unnamed official in India’s government. The defendant, Nikhil Gupta, 52, was arrested in the Czech Republic a year ago, and was extradited last week to make his first appearance in Manhattan federal court. He is accused of trying to arrange the murder of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American citizen and lawyer for a New York-based Sikh secessionist group. The murder attempt, which played out against a backdrop of doubt about India’s commitment to democracy, spanned several countries and mirrored the successful killing of another separatist in Canada, prosecutors say. On Monday morning, Mr. Gupta entered the Lower Manhattan courtroom in a blue cardigan and yellow patterned shirt and appeared relaxed as he spoke to his lawyer, Jeffrey Chabrowe, at the defense table. He has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since landing in the United States on Friday afternoon. In a statement to reporters after the arraignment, Mr. Chabrowe called the case a “complex matter"" for India and the United States. “Background and details will develop that may cast government allegations into an entirely new light,” he said. Mr. Gupta is charged with murder for hire and conspiracy to commit murder for hire. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison for each charge. He was sent back to the detention center after Monday’s arraignment and is set to appear in court again on June 28. In a statement Monday, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said Mr. Gupta will “now face justice” in an American courtroom. “This extradition makes clear that the Justice Department will not tolerate attempts to silence or harm American citizens,” he said. In an indictment unsealed in November, Manhattan federal prosecutors described an audacious plot that began around May 2023 when an Indian government employee enlisted Mr. Gupta to organize the killing of Mr. Pannun, who was living in New York at the time. Mr. Pannun is the general counsel of Sikhs for Justice, an organization that supports the secession of Punjab, a state in northern India. He is a vocal critic of the Indian government and has been banned from the country, prosecutors say. Mr. Gupta, who lived in India, had told the government official about “his involvement in international narcotics and weapons trafficking,” according to the indictment. At the direction of the Indian government employee, Mr. Gupta contacted a man who he believed would help him hire a hit man in New York, but who was, in fact, an agent for the American government. That agent introduced Mr. Gupta to an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration officer who pretended to be the hit man. In deals brokered by Mr. Gupta, the Indian government official agreed to pay the D.E.A. officer $100,000 to kill Mr. Pannun, including a $15,000 cash advance for the job, prosecutors said. Mr. Gupta then shared personal information about Mr. Pannun with the undercover officer, including Mr. Pannun’s address in New York and his phone number. When the Indian official asked for updates, Mr. Gupta relayed surveillance photos of Mr. Pannun that the agent had sent him. Mr. Gupta instructed the undercover officer to carry out the assassination as soon as possible, but asked him not to do it around the time of high-level meetings between U.S. and Indian officials, according to the indictment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington and met with President Biden in June 2023. Then, prosecutors said, on June 18 of that year, gunmen killed Hardeep Singh Nijjar, another Sikh separatist leader, in British Columbia, Canada. Mr. Nijjar knew Mr. Pannun and was also an outspoken critic of the Indian government. Soon after, prosecutors said, Mr. Gupta told the undercover officer that Mr. Nijjar “was also the target” and that “we have so many targets.” Mr. Gupta then told the officer — the pretend hit man — that there was “now no need to wait” to kill Mr. Pannun, prosecutors said. On Monday, Mr. Pannun said in a statement that he had “full faith” that the United States would hold Mr. Gupta and his co-conspirators accountable. “The attempt on my life on American soil is the blatant case of India’s transnational terrorism challenging America’s sovereignty and unequivocally proves that Modi’s India believes in using violence to suppress the dissenting political opinion,” he said. A spokesman for the Indian Embassy in Washington, D.C., could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. Mr. Gupta’s case has threatened to complicate the delicate relations among Washington, Ottawa and New Delhi. During his presidency, Mr. Biden has courted India’s leaders to counter the influence of Russia and China, despite growing concerns about India’s commitment to democracy. Mr. Modi, who has been in office since 2014, was re-elected as India’s prime minister in June, even as his Bharatiya Janata Party lost its majority in Parliament.",indian man pleaded guilty monday charge orchestrating failed assassination plot sikh separatist new york plan prosecutor say devised behalf unnamed official india government defendant nikhil gupta arrested czech republic year ago extradited last week make first appearance manhattan federal court accused trying arrange murder gurpatwant singh pannun american citizen lawyer new yorkbased sikh secessionist group murder attempt played backdrop doubt india commitment democracy spanned several country mirrored successful killing another separatist canada prosecutor say monday morning mr gupta entered lower manhattan courtroom blue cardigan yellow patterned shirt appeared relaxed spoke lawyer jeffrey chabrowe defense table held metropolitan detention center brooklyn since landing united state friday afternoon statement reporter arraignment mr chabrowe called case complex matter india united state background detail develop may cast government allegation entirely new light said mr gupta charged murder hire conspiracy commit murder hire convicted would face maximum year prison charge sent back detention center monday arraignment set appear court june statement monday attorney general merrick b garland said mr gupta face justice american courtroom extradition make clear justice department tolerate attempt silence harm american citizen said indictment unsealed november manhattan federal prosecutor described audacious plot began around may indian government employee enlisted mr gupta organize killing mr pannun living new york time mr pannun general counsel sikh justice organization support secession punjab state northern india vocal critic indian government banned country prosecutor say mr gupta lived india told government official involvement international narcotic weapon trafficking according indictment direction indian government employee mr gupta contacted man believed would help hire hit man new york fact agent american government agent introduced mr gupta undercover drug enforcement administration officer pretended hit man deal brokered mr gupta indian government official agreed pay dea officer kill mr pannun including cash advance job prosecutor said mr gupta shared personal information mr pannun undercover officer including mr pannuns address new york phone number indian official asked update mr gupta relayed surveillance photo mr pannun agent sent mr gupta instructed undercover officer carry assassination soon possible asked around time highlevel meeting u indian official according indictment prime minister narendra modi visited washington met president biden june prosecutor said june year gunman killed hardeep singh nijjar another sikh separatist leader british columbia canada mr nijjar knew mr pannun also outspoken critic indian government soon prosecutor said mr gupta told undercover officer mr nijjar also target many target mr gupta told officer pretend hit man need wait kill mr pannun prosecutor said monday mr pannun said statement full faith united state would hold mr gupta coconspirator accountable attempt life american soil blatant case india transnational terrorism challenging america sovereignty unequivocally prof modis india belief using violence suppress dissenting political opinion said spokesman indian embassy washington dc could immediately reached comment monday mr guptas case threatened complicate delicate relation among washington ottawa new delhi presidency mr biden courted india leader counter influence russia china despite growing concern india commitment democracy mr modi office since reelected india prime minister june even bharatiya janata party lost majority parliament,-41.0,negative,0
nytimes,Fire in Kuwait Worker Housing Leaves at Least 49 Dead,"June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/world/middleeast/fire-kuwait-migrant-worker-housing.html,"At least 49 people were killed and dozens of others injured in the Persian Gulf country of Kuwait, the state news agency said, when a fire broke out on Wednesday in a building that housed scores of low-income workers, many of them Indian nationals. The fire began during the morning in a coastal area called Mangaf, about half an hour’s drive from the center of the capital, Kuwait City. The Kuwaiti authorities have held the building owner for questioning as they investigate the cause of the fire and try to determine whether “any shortcoming or neglect” played a role, the state news agency reported. The authorities promised to begin a campaign to tackle building code violations. The public prosecutor’s office also planned to inspect the site and interview survivors. Speaking to journalists at the site of the fire, Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Al Sabah — Kuwait’s deputy prime minister and interior minister — blamed “the greed of property owners” for the disaster and said that the owner of the company employing the workers would also be detained, the Reuters news agency and Kuwaiti newspapers reported. Jayashankar, an Indian salesman who survived the fire, said that he awoke to screams around 4 a.m. local time. He and his roommates opened the door to their fourth-floor apartment and found that thick black smoke had enveloped the corridor, burning their lungs, he said in a phone interview, asking to be identified by his first name only for fear of retribution. Instead of trying to escape, he said, they locked the door, opened a window and waited for help. Two of his roommates who left the apartment to find an exit later died, he said. Witnesses told local news outlets that the fire had begun at the bottom of the seven-story building, sending smoke billowing upward. In a televised interview, an official in Kuwait’s firefighting force, Col. Sayed Hassan Al-Moussawi, said, “In a building like this, you’re supposed to go up to the roof, but unfortunately the door to the roof was locked.” Ramesh, an Indian worker who lives in a building next door and who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said in an interview that he saw people trying to jump out of windows to escape. The fire’s high death toll highlighted the perils faced by low-income immigrants to Gulf countries, who often toil under exploitative contracts and live in overcrowded housing, with regulatory protections that are limited or poorly enforced. Foreigners make up about two-thirds of the population of Kuwait, an oil-rich nation with one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds. Many are low-paid workers from South Asian countries who perform jobs including construction, restaurant service and street cleaning. More than 50 people hurt during the fire were sent to hospitals around Kuwait, with injuries including burns, broken bones from jumping out of the building and carbon monoxide poisoning from smoke inhalation, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. Nine were in critical condition, it said. Many of the workers affected were from India, the country’s embassy in Kuwait said on social media. On Wednesday, India’s ambassador to Kuwait, Adarsh Swaika, visited several hospitals where workers were taken, the embassy said in its posts. In a post on X, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India said that the fire was “saddening” and that the Indian Embassy would monitor the situation closely and work with the authorities “to assist the affected.” In a video published by the Kuwaiti news media, Sheikh Fahad was shown at the location of the fire, questioning an unidentified man about who lived in the building. The man told him that 196 people had lived there. The video cut off after Sheikh Fahad told the authorities to detain the man for questioning. Officials working in the municipality overseeing the area were also suspended from work pending an investigation, Kuwait’s state news agency reported. Building codes in Gulf countries are often laxly put in place, and smoke detectors and fire escapes are not common in residential properties. At the site of the fire on Wednesday afternoon, municipal employees were already putting up notices of violations on nearby buildings, including for partitioning rooms with gypsum board. Mangaf is predominantly inhabited by migrant workers, with apartment blocks housing men from India, Bangladesh and Egypt. Interviewed by The New York Times near the fire location, workers who lived nearby gave varying accounts of the numbers of men typically housed in each room, ranging from three to 12. Jayashankar, the survivor, said that nine people, all Indians, had shared his three-bedroom apartment. The building bore a sign saying it was a workers’ camp for a company called NBTC Group, a contracting firm headquartered in Kuwait with business in construction, industry, logistics and related fields. Phone calls to the company on Wednesday went unanswered, and an employee at the company’s offices said that staff members had been detained by officials that day. Another Indian worker who lived on the second floor of the building said that he and his roommates had survived because they had been out working an overnight shift. The worker, Sami, 45, who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said he had not yet been able to go inside to retrieve his belongings and inspect the damage because the police had closed off entrances to the building. Shahrukh Kha, who is from Bihar, India, said that he had spent all day trying to reach his brother, Kalu, who lived in the building, but that his brother’s phone was off. “We have not gotten any kind of information about whether he is injured or dead,” he said in a phone interview. Kalu Kha, a 30-year-old salesman who works in a fruit and vegetable shop, had been planning to travel home to India next month, his brother said; his wedding date is set for July 22.",least people killed dozen others injured persian gulf country kuwait state news agency said fire broke wednesday building housed score lowincome worker many indian national fire began morning coastal area called mangaf half hour drive center capital kuwait city kuwaiti authority held building owner questioning investigate cause fire try determine whether shortcoming neglect played role state news agency reported authority promised begin campaign tackle building code violation public prosecutor office also planned inspect site interview survivor speaking journalist site fire sheikh fahad yusuf al sabah kuwait deputy prime minister interior minister blamed greed property owner disaster said owner company employing worker would also detained reuters news agency kuwaiti newspaper reported jayashankar indian salesman survived fire said awoke scream around local time roommate opened door fourthfloor apartment found thick black smoke enveloped corridor burning lung said phone interview asking identified first name fear retribution instead trying escape said locked door opened window waited help two roommate left apartment find exit later died said witness told local news outlet fire begun bottom sevenstory building sending smoke billowing upward televised interview official kuwait firefighting force col sayed hassan almoussawi said building like youre supposed go roof unfortunately door roof locked ramesh indian worker life building next door also asked identified first name fear retribution said interview saw people trying jump window escape fire high death toll highlighted peril faced lowincome immigrant gulf country often toil exploitative contract live overcrowded housing regulatory protection limited poorly enforced foreigner make twothirds population kuwait oilrich nation one world largest sovereign wealth fund many lowpaid worker south asian country perform job including construction restaurant service street cleaning people hurt fire sent hospital around kuwait injury including burn broken bone jumping building carbon monoxide poisoning smoke inhalation ministry health said statement nine critical condition said many worker affected india country embassy kuwait said social medium wednesday india ambassador kuwait adarsh swaika visited several hospital worker taken embassy said post post x prime minister narendra modi india said fire saddening indian embassy would monitor situation closely work authority assist affected video published kuwaiti news medium sheikh fahad shown location fire questioning unidentified man lived building man told people lived video cut sheikh fahad told authority detain man questioning official working municipality overseeing area also suspended work pending investigation kuwait state news agency reported building code gulf country often laxly put place smoke detector fire escape common residential property site fire wednesday afternoon municipal employee already putting notice violation nearby building including partitioning room gypsum board mangaf predominantly inhabited migrant worker apartment block housing men india bangladesh egypt interviewed new york time near fire location worker lived nearby gave varying account number men typically housed room ranging three jayashankar survivor said nine people indian shared threebedroom apartment building bore sign saying worker camp company called nbtc group contracting firm headquartered kuwait business construction industry logistics related field phone call company wednesday went unanswered employee company office said staff member detained official day another indian worker lived second floor building said roommate survived working overnight shift worker sami also asked identified first name fear retribution said yet able go inside retrieve belonging inspect damage police closed entrance building shahrukh kha bihar india said spent day trying reach brother kalu lived building brother phone gotten kind information whether injured dead said phone interview kalu kha yearold salesman work fruit vegetable shop planning travel home india next month brother said wedding date set july,-71.0,negative,0
nytimes,Train Crash in India Leaves at Least 8 Dead and Dozens Injured,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/world/asia/india-train-crash.html,"A freight train collided with a passenger train in eastern India on Monday, killing at least eight people and injuring 50 others, officials said. The episode occurred at around 9 a.m. when the Kanchanjunga Express, which was carrying passengers to the state of West Bengal from the state of Tripura, was leaving the Rangapani station. Four coaches of the popular and often-crowded passenger train derailed when it was rammed from behind by the commercial train. Images from the accident site showed one of the passenger coaches lifted off the railway track and balancing on a coach of the freight train. The death toll was likely to rise. Local news outlets, citing police officials, reported at least 15 people dead. The driver and the assistant driver of the freight train and a guard on the passenger train were among those killed. Jaya Varma Sinha, the chairperson of India’s railway board, said rescue operations were completed. Ashwini Vaishnaw, India’s railway minister, was en route to the site. The relatively low number of casualties could be attributed to the fact that the rear portion of the Kanchanjunga Express, which took the biggest impact from the collision, comprised cargo coaches and the guard’s coach. Passengers were in compartments far forward from the impact. While an investigation has been ordered to look into the cause of the collision, Ms. Sinha said human error such as disregarding a railway signal could have caused the crash. The accident again brings to the fore the issue of rail safety in a country whose millions of poor residents rely on railways for transport. India’s rail network is one of the world’s largest and is crucial to the country’s economy and its people’s lives and livelihood. The country has, in recent years, invested heavily on rail safety after a long history of deadly accidents. Although the overall number of rail accidents has lessened over the past decade, incidents with mass casualties have persisted. Last June, 290 people were killed when two passenger trains collided after one of them struck a stationary freight train at full speed and derailed in the state of Odisha. After that incident, opposition leaders demanded the resignation of Mr. Vaishnaw, the railway minister. He has said he was trying to expand a safety system, called Kavach, that is meant to prevent accidents when two trains are moving on the same track. Ms. Sinha said the technology had not yet been deployed on the route of the Kanchanjunga Express.",freight train collided passenger train eastern india monday killing least eight people injuring others official said episode occurred around kanchanjunga express carrying passenger state west bengal state tripura leaving rangapani station four coach popular oftencrowded passenger train derailed rammed behind commercial train image accident site showed one passenger coach lifted railway track balancing coach freight train death toll likely rise local news outlet citing police official reported least people dead driver assistant driver freight train guard passenger train among killed jaya varma sinha chairperson india railway board said rescue operation completed ashwini vaishnaw india railway minister en route site relatively low number casualty could attributed fact rear portion kanchanjunga express took biggest impact collision comprised cargo coach guard coach passenger compartment far forward impact investigation ordered look cause collision m sinha said human error disregarding railway signal could caused crash accident brings fore issue rail safety country whose million poor resident rely railway transport india rail network one world largest crucial country economy people life livelihood country recent year invested heavily rail safety long history deadly accident although overall number rail accident lessened past decade incident mass casualty persisted last june people killed two passenger train collided one struck stationary freight train full speed derailed state odisha incident opposition leader demanded resignation mr vaishnaw railway minister said trying expand safety system called kavach meant prevent accident two train moving track m sinha said technology yet deployed route kanchanjunga express,-40.0,negative,2
nytimes,"G7 Leaders, Expanding the Circle, Shift Focus to Migration and the South","June 14, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/world/europe/g7-summit-ai-china-india.html,"The Group of 7 countries threw open the doors of their club on Friday to India, Brazil, Turkey and other non-Western countries, acknowledging a shifting global landscape as they tried to enlist these nations’ leaders in causes ranging from climate change to managing the economic competition with China. While diplomats from the Group of 7 hammered out a communiqué that pledged support for Ukraine in its war against Russia and greater ambition in curbing carbon emissions, the focus was on Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and other leaders from outside the G7, whose support is increasingly critical to achieving any of these goals. Among the thorny questions on the second day of the summit: migration, which has helped fuel a recent resurgence of populism and far-right parties in Europe and the United States. The leaders also discussed the war in Gaza and China’s state subsidies of industries like electric vehicles, which has prompted the United States and the European Union to impose tariffs on Chinese exports. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, who is hosting the gathering, said the goal of her expanded guest list was to “strengthen dialogue with the nations of the Global South.” She insisted that the Group of 7 was “not a fortress closed in itself” but “an offer of values that we open to the world.” Ms. Meloni recruited Pope Francis to speak to the leaders about the dangers posed by artificial intelligence. Francis urged them to regulate the technology, of which he was himself a victim when A.I.-generated fake images of him clad in a white puffer jacket and a jewel-encrusted crucifix went viral last year. “The benefits and the damages it causes will depend on the way it is used,” the pope declared, warning of the risks of A.I.’s uncontrolled development. He called for lethal autonomous weapons, which are unmanned and uncontrolled by a human hand, to be banned, saying, “No machine should ever decide whether to take the life of a human being away.” The pope’s appearance was the emotional highlight of a day of carefully staged summitry that seemed to concede that the West is less dominant demographically and economically than in the past — and that it is listening to calls for more equity and balance in global decision-making. As Ms. Meloni guided the pope, in a wheelchair, around a circular table to meet the leaders, he was greeted by a visibly moved President Biden and got an enthusiastic hug from Argentina’s flamboyant president, Javier Milei, whose election last November was viewed as another sign of the rising tide of populism across the Americas and Europe. This is not the first time non-Western leaders have been invited to a Group of 7 meeting, but rarely have they been so conspicuous. In part that reflects the issues that Ms. Meloni has highlighted: Africa and the Mediterranean. The leaders of Algeria, Kenya and Tunisia were on hand at a luxury resort hotel on Italy’s southern coast, as was President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. “Inviting key developing country leaders reflects the reality that confronting China and Russia requires the cooperation of more than the G7,” said Daniel M. Price, who was a top trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “And Brazil, India and Turkey are as concerned about Chinese predatory trade practices and overcapacity as are Japan, Europe and the U.S.” The final G7 communiqué voiced concern about what the leaders called China’s “persistent industrial targeting and comprehensive nonmarket policies and practices that are leading to global spillovers, market distortions and harmful overcapacity.” The communiqué endorsed Mr. Biden’s effort to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. France and Canada had pushed for stronger language on Israel’s conduct of the war, according to people familiar with the negotiations, but the United States and Germany resisted. In a victory for Ms. Meloni, a conservative who opposes abortion, the communiqué did not include an explicit reference to abortion, in a passage that pledged to promote “comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.” A communiqué released by the Group of 7 leaders after their last summit in Hiroshima, Japan, referred specifically to abortion rights. The issue injected a briefly discordant note into the gathering after President Emmanuel Macron of France told an Italian journalist that some politicians did not share France’s “vision of equality between women and men.” Ms. Meloni criticized Mr. Macron, who recently called a snap parliamentary election, as seeking to politicize the issue at a “precious forum like the G7.” For the most part, however, the meeting underscored harmony among the leaders, many of whom are embattled by their own domestic politics. It also served as a platform for Ms. Meloni, 47, who has overcome initial qualms about her political roots in a party built on the ashes of fascism to win respect for her steadfast support of Ukraine. Presiding over the two days of meetings, she was able to put a spotlight on several of her pet issues. How to control migration has vexed the United States and Europe, compounded by the effects of climate change and warfare in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Ukraine. It is a particularly delicate issue for Ms. Meloni, who has campaigned hard to fight what she has called “uncontrolled immigration” to Italy and other parts of Europe from Africa and the Middle East. While Europe has welcomed thousands of Ukrainians, especially women and children, fleeing the Russian invasion, Ukrainian officials have urged European countries to help them repatriate men of fighting age. “Turkey is a critical player on global migration,” said Peter Westmacott, who served as Britain’s ambassador to Turkey, France and the United States. He noted that there are about three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds and Afghans. “If Europe wants to control migration from these countries,” Mr. Westmacott said, “Turkey is an indispensable partner.” Mr. Erdogan, he said, could also yet play a role in brokering an end to Ukraine’s war with Russia. As a Black Sea power, Turkey has kept open its commercial and political links to Russia. But it is also a NATO member and has supplied cheap, highly effective drones to help the Ukrainian resistance. Some of the invitations reflected diplomatic protocol, according to Italian officials. Brazil, India and South Africa were automatically included as current or future presidents of the Group of 20 industrialized nations. Argentina was invited, these officials said, because Mr. Milei has recognized the connections and interdependence between East and West. He and Ms. Meloni have also cultivated close personal ties, sharing a right-wing populism that includes opposition to abortion and gay rights.",group country threw open door club friday india brazil turkey nonwestern country acknowledging shifting global landscape tried enlist nation leader cause ranging climate change managing economic competition china diplomat group hammered communiqu pledged support ukraine war russia greater ambition curbing carbon emission focus prime minister narendra modi india president luiz incio lula da silva brazil leader outside g whose support increasingly critical achieving goal among thorny question second day summit migration helped fuel recent resurgence populism farright party europe united state leader also discussed war gaza china state subsidy industry like electric vehicle prompted united state european union impose tariff chinese export prime minister giorgia meloni italy hosting gathering said goal expanded guest list strengthen dialogue nation global south insisted group fortress closed offer value open world m meloni recruited pope francis speak leader danger posed artificial intelligence francis urged regulate technology victim aigenerated fake image clad white puffer jacket jewelencrusted crucifix went viral last year benefit damage cause depend way used pope declared warning risk ai uncontrolled development called lethal autonomous weapon unmanned uncontrolled human hand banned saying machine ever decide whether take life human away pope appearance emotional highlight day carefully staged summitry seemed concede west le dominant demographically economically past listening call equity balance global decisionmaking m meloni guided pope wheelchair around circular table meet leader greeted visibly moved president biden got enthusiastic hug argentina flamboyant president javier milei whose election last november viewed another sign rising tide populism across america europe first time nonwestern leader invited group meeting rarely conspicuous part reflects issue m meloni highlighted africa mediterranean leader algeria kenya tunisia hand luxury resort hotel italy southern coast president recep tayyip erdogan turkey inviting key developing country leader reflects reality confronting china russia requires cooperation g said daniel price top trade adviser president george w bush brazil india turkey concerned chinese predatory trade practice overcapacity japan europe u final g communiqu voiced concern leader called china persistent industrial targeting comprehensive nonmarket policy practice leading global spillover market distortion harmful overcapacity communiqu endorsed mr bidens effort broker ceasefire israel hamas gaza france canada pushed stronger language israel conduct war according people familiar negotiation united state germany resisted victory m meloni conservative opposes abortion communiqu include explicit reference abortion passage pledged promote comprehensive sexual reproductive health right communiqu released group leader last summit hiroshima japan referred specifically abortion right issue injected briefly discordant note gathering president emmanuel macron france told italian journalist politician share france vision equality woman men m meloni criticized mr macron recently called snap parliamentary election seeking politicize issue precious forum like g part however meeting underscored harmony among leader many embattled domestic politics also served platform m meloni overcome initial qualm political root party built ash fascism win respect steadfast support ukraine presiding two day meeting able put spotlight several pet issue control migration vexed united state europe compounded effect climate change warfare afghanistan middle east ukraine particularly delicate issue m meloni campaigned hard fight called uncontrolled immigration italy part europe africa middle east europe welcomed thousand ukrainian especially woman child fleeing russian invasion ukrainian official urged european country help repatriate men fighting age turkey critical player global migration said peter westmacott served britain ambassador turkey france united state noted three million syrian refugee turkey well hundred thousand iraqi kurd afghan europe want control migration country mr westmacott said turkey indispensable partner mr erdogan said could also yet play role brokering end ukraine war russia black sea power turkey kept open commercial political link russia also nato member supplied cheap highly effective drone help ukrainian resistance invitation reflected diplomatic protocol according italian official brazil india south africa automatically included current future president group industrialized nation argentina invited official said mr milei recognized connection interdependence east west m meloni also cultivated close personal tie sharing rightwing populism includes opposition abortion gay right,26.0,positive,0
nytimes,"At the Ambani Wedding Celebrations, a Dazzling Display of Jewels","June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/fashion/weddings/ambani-jewels.html,"When Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India abruptly changed her country’s constitution in 1971 and abolished the Privy Purse, a government allowance for the country’s former princely rulers, she also moved to nationalize their storied treasuries. Among the maharajahs, nizams and nabobs that once ruled the subcontinent, this set off a frenzy as they scurried to bury the family jewels. For centuries, the rarity, scale and grandeur of Indian jewels was so great that many became iconic objects. Take the Patiala Necklace, a tiered ornament resembling draperies of gems. Designed by Cartier, it featured an astounding 2,930 diamonds and centered on a single rock the size of a walnut. Or consider the Indore Pears, two stupendous and closely matched diamonds owned by Maharajah Yeshwant Rao Holkar II, a glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom was in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Indian princely patronage long set a global standard of splendor for both artistry and ostentation in the jewel trade. Yet in the decades after the Privy Purse, most of the big rocks seemed to have vanished underground. Legend has it that members of formerly royal families stashed their jewels in Swiss vaults, pawned them on the black market or hid them in flower pots. Bling on a royal scale largely disappeared. Or so it seemed until a fresh cadre of princes heaved into view: oligarchs. The richest of these by orders of magnitude is Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of his family’s megacompany Reliance Industries. Mr. Ambani’s personal fortune is estimated by Forbes at a staggering $115 billion. Despite his vast wealth, few outside India had heard of him — that is, until March 1, when he hosted a three-day party to celebrate his son Anant’s wedding in July. Everything about the prewedding affair was on a princely scale: the guest list of 1,000, including boldface names like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump; a glass palace specially constructed in the Ambani’s hometown, Jamnagar, in the western state of Gujarat; and Rihanna’s first public performance in years. Rihanna’s reported $6 million payday hogged the headlines, but what lit up at least one obsessive corner of the internet was the Ambani jewelry. This included necklaces and earrings and rings and hair ornaments of a size and grandeur seldom seen publicly since the days of the Raj. “It was almost like the time of maharajahs 100 years down the line,” said Pramod Kumar, an archivist and a founder of the museum consultancy EKA. He is also keeper of topophilia.india, an erudite Instagram account that is catnip for Indophile aesthetes. Mr. Kumar’s sleuth work traced a possible source of the two most gobsmacking gems seen at the Ambani prewedding celebration: massive step-cut Colombian emeralds roughly the size of Popsicles. Draped one below the other as pendants to a diamond necklace, they were worn one evening by the bridegroom’s mother, Nita Ambani. The bigger one was “of 562 carats,” Mr. Kumar wrote in an Instagram post, adding that the weight of the smaller stone was a mere 303 carats. Whatever their source, those emeralds were just two among many gems on display throughout an event at which the jewels often had greater star power than their wearers. “That emerald necklace was what caught everyone’s attention at first, but it was all almost unfathomable,” said Stellene Volandes, the editor in chief of Town & Country. She noted the scarcity represented by ropes of the rarest natural pearls from the Arabian Sea; necklaces in the heavy, ornate rani haar style studded with diamonds; and headpieces known as maang tikka, made with deep green emeralds from the storied Muzo mines. “You’d be very hard-pressed to find comparables for the sheer size and horsepower” of the jewels at the Ambani prewedding party, said Nico Landrigan, the president of the Verdura jewelry house in New York. “The Indians are a jewelry-obsessed culture in a category all their own. So you can only imagine what the actual wedding will bring out.” Before the wedding, scheduled for July 12 to 14 in Mumbai, there was yet another lavish preparatory celebration and opportunity to flaunt big rocks — a cruise from the Tyrrhenian Sea in Palermo, Italy, to the Mediterranean in Cannes, France, on an ocean liner whose 2,400 staterooms had been retrofitted for the Ambanis as three-bedroom suites for 800 invited guests. “Basically, what the Ambanis are doing is displaying a kind of old-style Hollywood glam,” said Mr. Kumar of EKA. “You don’t see that with any other current billionaire moguls in Europe or America, at least not in the public realm.” For Daniela Mascetti, the former chairwoman of Sotheby’s jewelry division in Europe and an author of “Understanding Jewelry,” a bible of the trade, the group more aptly compared to the Ambanis is the robber barons of the Industrial Age. “You have to look back to Vanderbilt or Gould, who also wanted big door-stoppers,” Ms. Mascetti said from London. “Let’s put it in a nice way,” she added. “If you are new money and you want to display wealth, you go big.” Yet it is not altogether that simple. Certain Ambani jewels were crafted using the whopper stones, but that is not to suggest that the determining factor in commissioning them was size. “There is tremendous artistry in the work,” said Ms. Volandes of Town & Country. Much of the Ambani jewels were designed by Viren Bhagat, among the more refined high jewelers, though also an assiduously private one. More than the size of individual stones like the stepped-cut emeralds, few save a detective like Mr. Kumar could predict their origins. “Being one-off is of the greatest importance in that world,” Francesca Amfitheatrof, the creative director of high jewelry and watches at Louis Vuitton, said recently from St.-Tropez, France, where she was debuting her latest collection. “To be able to source things that are so unique and outstanding, honestly, only an emperor has that possibility anymore,” she said. “It’s completely maharajah-like. It’s imperial.”",prime minister indira gandhi india abruptly changed country constitution abolished privy purse government allowance country former princely ruler also moved nationalize storied treasury among maharajah nizams nabob ruled subcontinent set frenzy scurried bury family jewel century rarity scale grandeur indian jewel great many became iconic object take patiala necklace tiered ornament resembling drapery gem designed cartier featured astounding diamond centered single rock size walnut consider indore pear two stupendous closely matched diamond owned maharajah yeshwant rao holkar ii glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom central indian state madhya pradesh indian princely patronage long set global standard splendor artistry ostentation jewel trade yet decade privy purse big rock seemed vanished underground legend member formerly royal family stashed jewel swiss vault pawned black market hid flower pot bling royal scale largely disappeared seemed fresh cadre prince heaved view oligarch richest order magnitude mukesh ambani chairman family megacompany reliance industry mr ambanis personal fortune estimated forbes staggering billion despite vast wealth outside india heard march hosted threeday party celebrate son anants wedding july everything prewedding affair princely scale guest list including boldface name like mark zuckerberg bill gate ivanka trump glass palace specially constructed ambanis hometown jamnagar western state gujarat rihannas first public performance year rihannas reported million payday hogged headline lit least one obsessive corner internet ambani jewelry included necklace earring ring hair ornament size grandeur seldom seen publicly since day raj almost like time maharajah year line said pramod kumar archivist founder museum consultancy eka also keeper topophiliaindia erudite instagram account catnip indophile aesthete mr kumars sleuth work traced possible source two gobsmacking gem seen ambani prewedding celebration massive stepcut colombian emerald roughly size popsicle draped one pendant diamond necklace worn one evening bridegroom mother nita ambani bigger one carat mr kumar wrote instagram post adding weight smaller stone mere carat whatever source emerald two among many gem display throughout event jewel often greater star power wearer emerald necklace caught everyones attention first almost unfathomable said stellene volandes editor chief town country noted scarcity represented rope rarest natural pearl arabian sea necklace heavy ornate rani haar style studded diamond headpiece known maang tikka made deep green emerald storied muzo mine youd hardpressed find comparables sheer size horsepower jewel ambani prewedding party said nico landrigan president verdura jewelry house new york indian jewelryobsessed culture category imagine actual wedding bring wedding scheduled july mumbai yet another lavish preparatory celebration opportunity flaunt big rock cruise tyrrhenian sea palermo italy mediterranean cannes france ocean liner whose stateroom retrofitted ambanis threebedroom suite invited guest basically ambanis displaying kind oldstyle hollywood glam said mr kumar eka dont see current billionaire mogul europe america least public realm daniela mascetti former chairwoman sothebys jewelry division europe author understanding jewelry bible trade group aptly compared ambanis robber baron industrial age look back vanderbilt gould also wanted big doorstopper m mascetti said london let put nice way added new money want display wealth go big yet altogether simple certain ambani jewel crafted using whopper stone suggest determining factor commissioning size tremendous artistry work said m volandes town country much ambani jewel designed viren bhagat among refined high jeweler though also assiduously private one size individual stone like steppedcut emerald save detective like mr kumar could predict origin oneoff greatest importance world francesca amfitheatrof creative director high jewelry watch louis vuitton said recently sttropez france debuting latest collection able source thing unique outstanding honestly emperor possibility anymore said completely maharajahlike imperial,80.0,positive,0

nytimes,"India-Pakistan Cricket World Cup Match Brings 34,000 Fans to Long Island","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/nyregion/india-pakistan-cricket-world-cup.html,"Normally at this time of year, the grassy southeastern corner of Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, N.Y., is a place for softball games, family picnics and a few cricket players enjoying a warm weekend afternoon. On Sunday, that space was transformed into a stage for one of the most-watched global sporting events of the year. More than 34,000 fans and cricket dignitaries squeezed into a temporary stadium built in the last three months in the Long Island park to watch the most anticipated match of the T20 Cricket World Cup: India versus Pakistan. For about three hours, fans in blue and orange India shirts mingled with their (vastly outnumbered) rivals in the dark green of Pakistan, producing a festive and vibrant atmosphere. They roared at every big play, shouting and waving signs and flags. They ate South Asian food sold at the concession stands, jumped, chanted, high-fived with fellow supporters and — after a bit of rain — soaked up the sunshine on a historic day at the usually quiet park. “It was electric,” said Chandu Talla, an India fan and entrepreneur from Tampa, Fla., who came to the match with his son Aryan, a high school junior. “We paid $2,500 per ticket and no regrets,” he added. “It was a dream come true to see India here.” After a slow start, India came back strong to win, and when Pakistan’s Naseem Shah hit the last ball from India bowler Arshdeep Singh, the India fans erupted in cheers. “It was pretty good,” said India bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who was named the player of the match. “Always, when India and Pakistan play, a lot of emotion does come in. It did feel like we had a lot of support.” People in the New York area may have been mostly oblivious to it, but any match between India and Pakistan, two of the greatest cricketing nations, is a monumental event, at least in South Asia and other cricket-loving parts of the world. The previous time the teams played, last fall, viewership reached 398 million in India alone, according to the International Cricket Council. (This year’s Super Bowl had 123 million viewers.) Sunday’s attendance (34,028) constituted the largest at an international cricket match in the United States, according to the I.C.C. Attendees included such cricketing legends as Yuvraj Singh of India, Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi and Australia’s Ricky Ponting. For Omar Minaya, the Yankees’ special adviser and the former general manager of the Mets, the cricket match was his first. “It’s amazing,” he said. “The atmosphere is great. It’s like the World Baseball Classic, or the Dominican Baseball League.” The T20 World Cup, held every two years, is a 20-nation tournament featuring a shorter form of cricket. This year, for the first time, the event is being held in the United States and several Caribbean nations where cricket is revered. The U.S. matches are also being held in Dallas and Lauderhill, Fla., but New York was designated for the marquee matchup. Cricket is part of the cultural fabric in both India and Pakistan, but political tensions over the decades have forced the countries to play each other in other places. “Oh, it’s contentious, a real battle of sentiments,” said Narinder Kapoor, 84, a retired U.S. Treasury Department agent, originally from New Delhi. “When these countries play, it’s a real hot potato.” A former amateur cricket player who emigrated to Syosset, N.Y., in 1972, Mr. Kapoor had not seen a cricket match live since 1974, although he watches the sport constantly on TV. He went to the game between Ireland and Canada on Friday and had hoped to attend Sunday’s big encounter, but his knees were ailing him, so he stayed home, according to his son, Sandeep Kapoor. The elder Mr. Kapoor said that he enjoyed the sparsely attended match on Friday, but added that the temporary stadium did not have enough accommodations for people with disabilities and that it was difficult for older people to ascend the steps. “But once you are inside, the field and the view is excellent,” he said. “World class.” Security was tight for the match, especially after a website purportedly affiliated with the terrorist organization ISIS called for attacks on the event. Mounted police, SWAT units, sniffer dogs, helicopters and large numbers of police officers swarmed the area, and long lines formed at entrances as people went through security scanners. Bruce Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, said that the I.C.C. had defrayed some of the cost of the security, which he said included local, state and federal agencies, including the F.B.I. “I want to commend the fans,” Mr. Blakeman said, adding, “Everybody has been so polite and respectful, and they followed instructions so they could be safe and healthy.” There was at least one exception. An airplane trailing a sign that said “Release Imran Khan” breached restricted airspace over the stadium before the match. (Mr. Khan, a former Pakistani cricket star and former prime minister of Pakistan, is serving a prison sentence there.) Mr. Blakeman said the plane was eventually intercepted. The mood at the park was generally upbeat, even for Pakistan fans on the losing end. “India-Pakistan is a very big deal,” said Temu Martin, an airfreight transport official from New Jersey and a Pakistan supporter. “But it’s not war. It’s a game.” He said that after Pakistan lost to the United States last week in a major upset in Dallas, ticket prices for Sunday’s match in East Meadow plummeted from over $2,000 to $600. He said he was planning to travel to Barbados for Pakistan’s next match and then to attend a knockout-stage match in Antigua. There are three more matches scheduled in New York, with the final one on Wednesday between India and the United States. The stadium will then be dismantled and the pieces sent out to other sporting events around the country. Mr. Blakeman predicted that Nassau County would make $150 million on the eight New York games of the tournament — 10 times what the county spent on infrastructure, planning and security, he said. Cricket officials had told him that there could be as many as 600 million viewers worldwide for Sunday’s match, he added. He said that he had heard from investors who want to bring the sport, perhaps with New York’s franchise in Major League Cricket, to Nassau County. “The way things have gone here these last couple of weeks, I think cricket has found a home,” Mr. Blakeman said.",normally time year grassy southeastern corner eisenhower park east meadow ny place softball game family picnic cricket player enjoying warm weekend afternoon sunday space transformed stage one mostwatched global sporting event year fan cricket dignitary squeezed temporary stadium built last three month long island park watch anticipated match cricket world cup india versus pakistan three hour fan blue orange india shirt mingled vastly outnumbered rival dark green pakistan producing festive vibrant atmosphere roared every big play shouting waving sign flag ate south asian food sold concession stand jumped chanted highfived fellow supporter bit rain soaked sunshine historic day usually quiet park electric said chandu talla india fan entrepreneur tampa fla came match son aryan high school junior paid per ticket regret added dream come true see india slow start india came back strong win pakistan naseem shah hit last ball india bowler arshdeep singh india fan erupted cheer pretty good said india bowler jasprit bumrah named player match always india pakistan play lot emotion come feel like lot support people new york area may mostly oblivious match india pakistan two greatest cricketing nation monumental event least south asia cricketloving part world previous time team played last fall viewership reached million india alone according international cricket council year super bowl million viewer sunday attendance constituted largest international cricket match united state according icc attendee included cricketing legend yuvraj singh india pakistan shahid afridi australia ricky ponting omar minaya yankee special adviser former general manager mets cricket match first amazing said atmosphere great like world baseball classic dominican baseball league world cup held every two year nation tournament featuring shorter form cricket year first time event held united state several caribbean nation cricket revered u match also held dallas lauderhill fla new york designated marquee matchup cricket part cultural fabric india pakistan political tension decade forced country play place oh contentious real battle sentiment said narinder kapoor retired u treasury department agent originally new delhi country play real hot potato former amateur cricket player emigrated syosset ny mr kapoor seen cricket match live since although watch sport constantly tv went game ireland canada friday hoped attend sunday big encounter knee ailing stayed home according son sandeep kapoor elder mr kapoor said enjoyed sparsely attended match friday added temporary stadium enough accommodation people disability difficult older people ascend step inside field view excellent said world class security tight match especially website purportedly affiliated terrorist organization isi called attack event mounted police swat unit sniffer dog helicopter large number police officer swarmed area long line formed entrance people went security scanner bruce blakeman nassau county executive said icc defrayed cost security said included local state federal agency including fbi want commend fan mr blakeman said adding everybody polite respectful followed instruction could safe healthy least one exception airplane trailing sign said release imran khan breached restricted airspace stadium match mr khan former pakistani cricket star former prime minister pakistan serving prison sentence mr blakeman said plane eventually intercepted mood park generally upbeat even pakistan fan losing end indiapakistan big deal said temu martin airfreight transport official new jersey pakistan supporter war game said pakistan lost united state last week major upset dallas ticket price sunday match east meadow plummeted said planning travel barbados pakistan next match attend knockoutstage match antigua three match scheduled new york final one wednesday india united state stadium dismantled piece sent sporting event around country mr blakeman predicted nassau county would make million eight new york game tournament time county spent infrastructure planning security said cricket official told could many million viewer worldwide sunday match added said heard investor want bring sport perhaps new york franchise major league cricket nassau county way thing gone last couple week think cricket found home mr blakeman said,53.0,positive,0
nytimes,"Modi, Striking a Modest Tone, Is Sworn In for a Third Term","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/world/asia/india-changed-modi-swearing-in.html,"As a humbled Narendra Modi was sworn in on Sunday for a third term as India’s prime minister, the political air in New Delhi appeared transformed. The election that ended last week stripped Mr. Modi of his parliamentary majority and forced him to turn to a diverse set of coalition partners to stay in power. Now, these other parties are enjoying something that for years was singularly Mr. Modi’s: relevance and the spotlight. Their leaders have been swarmed by TV crews while on their way to present demands and policy opinions to Mr. Modi. His opponents, too, have been getting more airtime, with stations cutting live to their news conferences, something almost unheard-of in recent years. Above all, the change can be seen in Mr. Modi himself. For now, at least, the messianic air is gone. He pitches himself as the modest administrator that voters showed they wanted. “To run the government, a majority is necessary. But to run the nation, a consensus is necessary,” Mr. Modi said in a speech on Friday to members of his coalition ahead of his swearing in. “The people want us to deliver better than before.” A visibly emotional Mr. Modi took the oath of office on Sunday evening, only the second prime minister to be elected for a third consecutive term in the seven decades of India’s republic. The ceremony, at the country’s presidential palace, was attended by about 8,000 supporters and dignitaries, including the leaders of India’s neighboring nations. To many, Mr. Modi’s shift in approach can mean only good things for the country’s democracy — a move toward moderation in a hugely diverse nation that was being whipped into a Hindu-first monolith in the image of one man. The question is whether Mr. Modi can truly become something he has not been during his two-plus decades in elected office: a consensus builder. “He is a pragmatic politician and, for his own survival and for the survival of his party, he will be a little mellowed,” said Ashutosh, a New Delhi-based analyst who uses only one name and is the author of a book on how Indian politics have changed under Mr. Modi. “But to assume a qualitative change in his style of governance is expecting too much.” A trademark of Mr. Modi’s leadership in recent years has been the use of power levers at his disposal — from pressure of police cases to the lure of a share in power and its perks — to break his opponents and get them to switch to his side. A bruised governing party may well try such tactics to peel away some lawmakers to his side, analyst say, to buttress his place at the top. But in the days leading up to the swearing-in, a change in approach was evident. When members of the new coalition packed into the hall of India’s old Parliament building on Friday for deliberations on forming the government, every time a senior ally seated next to him stood up to start his speech, Mr. Modi also stood up. When it was time for Mr. Modi to be garlanded as the coalition’s choice for prime minister, he waited for the leaders of the two main coalition partners to arrive by his side before the congratulatory wreath of purple orchids was placed around his neck. His hourlong address contained none of his usual references to himself in the third person. His tone was measured. He focused on the coalition’s promise of “good governance” and “the dream of a developed India,” and he acknowledged that things would be different from the past 10 years. The last time Mr. Modi came to the Parliament complex for a closely watched event, last May when he inaugurated a new, more modern building for the assembly, he made an entrance some observers compared with that of a king: with markings on his forehead as a sign of piety and a scepter in his hand, as shirtless, chanting Hindu monks walked ahead of and behind him. This time, he went straight to a copy of the Constitution, which declares that India is a secular and socialist democracy, bowing before it and lifting it to his forehead. For the first time in his more than two decades in elected office, Mr. Modi finds himself in uncharted territory. Until now, as long as he has been at the helm — whether at the state level as the chief minister of Gujarat or at the national level — his Bharatiya Janata Party has always had a majority. Analysts say that history of never having been in the opposition has shaped his heavy-handed approach to politics. When he left Gujarat, after 13 years, he had established such a firm grip and had so routed the opposition that the state had effectively become one of single-party rule. His first national victory in 2014, with a majority for his B.J.P., ended decades of coalition governance in India, in which no party had been able to capture the 272 seats in Parliament necessary for a majority. In 2019, he was re-elected with an even bigger majority. Mr. Modi’s enormous power helped swiftly carry out what had for decades been his right-wing party’s agenda, including construction of a lavish Hindu temple on a long-disputed site that once held a mosque, and the revocation of the special status long enjoyed by the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir. A separatist insurgency has long troubled the Himalayan Kashmir region. As the inauguration ceremony began in New Delhi on Sunday, a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims in the Reasi district fell into a gorge after gunmen opened fire on it. At least eight people were killed, the police said. A trademark of Mr. Modi’s governance was a disregard for parliamentary procedures and for debates on legislation. His unexpected, overnight demonetization in 2016 — which invalidated India’s currency in an effort to crack down on corruption — threw the country into chaos and dealt a blow to a still cash-driven economy. Similarly, rushing to enact laws aimed at overhauling the agriculture market resulted in a year of protests that choked Delhi, forcing Mr. Modi to retreat. Before the election results came out, Mr. Modi’s party had predicted that his coalition would win 400 seats in India’s 543-seat Parliament. The opposition would be reduced to sitting “in the spectators’ gallery,” Mr. Modi said. Officials in his government had made clear that in his new term he would seek to put in place the only main item remaining on his party’s agenda: legislating a “uniform civil code” across this diverse country to replace varying laws of different religions that currently govern issues like marriage and inheritance. His party leaders spoke of Mr. Modi not only as their leader for the current term, but also for the next election in 2029, when he would be 78. “He has been trying to transform the country,” Sudesh Verma, a B.J.P. official who wrote a book on Mr. Modi’s rise, said in an interview before the election results were announced. “I look forward to him working like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, who worked into his 90s.” But under a coalition government, Mr. Modi’s traditional approach will be difficult. Two of the main coalition parties that helped him achieve the minimum number of Parliament seats to form a government are secular, in contrast to Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist ideology. N. Chandrababu Naidu, whose party holds 16 seats, has been scathing in the past in his criticism of Mr. Modi’s treatment of the Muslim minority. He has also openly criticized Mr. Modi for using the central investigating agencies to target his opponents and taking “steps to subvert all democratic institutions.” Neerja Chowdhury, a political analyst in Delhi and the author of the 2023 book “How Prime Ministers Decide,” said, “The contentious ideological issues, like the enactment of the uniform civil code, may be put on the back burner if the allies are not comfortable with it.” Mr. Modi’s popular image is built on two strong pillars. He is a champion of economic development, with an inspiring biography of a rise from a humble caste and relative poverty. He is also a lifelong Hindu nationalist, with decades as a foot soldier in a movement seeking to turn India’s secular and diverse state into an overtly Hindu-first place. At the peak of his power, the Hindu nationalist aspect increasingly dominated. Analysts say that the recent rebuke by voters might be a lucky break for the nation: prompting Mr. Modi to tap into his development champion side, and to focus on a legacy of economic transformation that could improve the lives of all Indians.",humbled narendra modi sworn sunday third term india prime minister political air new delhi appeared transformed election ended last week stripped mr modi

nytimes,"India’s Modi, Humbled by Voters, Faces Potent Economic Struggles","June 7, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/business/india-election-modi-economy.html,"Before the Indian election results emerged this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was widely viewed as a charismatic and popular strongman celebrated by the business world for elevating its importance, even as he failed to solve a vexing problem: how to turn swift economic growth into critically needed jobs. After the election, Mr. Modi finds himself staring at that same monumental puzzle, yet relegated to an uncomfortable new status. He is the head of a party that has been chastened at the polls, forcing him to forge a coalition to maintain power. Mr. Modi’s governing authority is likely to be constrained by the complexities of keeping his coalition partners on his side. He could not solve India’s most deep-seated economic challenge when he wielded a monopolistic hold on power. Now, he is a weakened leader who must balance additional interests, while still lacking an obvious way to improve living standards. “There has been a sense that employment growth has been weak in the last four, five years,” said Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic adviser to the Modi administration, who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “How do you create more jobs? This is really India’s central economic challenge, but I think the government will find itself with relatively limited tools.” The humbling of Mr. Modi’s party resonates in part as an expression of popular frustration that India remains a land of economic peril for hundreds of millions of people, as well as a country defined by astonishing contrasts in wealth. In major cities, five-star hotels boasting sumptuous spas look down on teeming slums that lack plumbing. In rural areas, malnutrition prevails under many roofs, and families struggle to find the money to keep children in school. Though its working-age population numbers roughly one billion, India has only 430 million jobs, according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, an independent research institution in Mumbai. And most of those counted as employed are stuck in precarious circumstances as day laborers and farm hands, lacking reliable wages and government workplace protections. Improved livelihoods are evident in many cities, from the high-rise apartments filling out the horizons to air-conditioned shopping malls and luxury cars choking roads. But the gains are narrowly concentrated. Professionals who work in technology centers in the south of the country and around the capital of New Delhi have enjoyed substantial progress. A rapidly growing domestic auto industry is a source of relatively high-paying jobs. Magnates like Gautam Adani, one of Asia’s richest men, have seen their business empires enhanced by their relationships with Mr. Modi and his willingness to eviscerate regulatory impediments to their greater fortune. But most Indian workers are effectively marooned in the so-called informal sector — laboring at roadside stalls, in small shops and in itinerant trades where they have no guarantee of income or the possibility of advancement. The failure of economic growth to yield more jobs is in large part the story of how India missed out on the manufacturing boom that played out in East Asia over recent decades. From South Korea and China to Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, hundreds of millions of people have escaped poverty via wages earned in factories. India has not shared in that transformation in large part because of a historical focus on self-sufficiency, a disdain for international trade and stultifying bureaucracy that has discouraged investment. “The whole manufacturing thing bypassed India,” Mr. Subramanian, the economist, said. “It’s that bigger development failure that is continuing to haunt India.” Mr. Modi has pursued initiatives aimed at bolstering manufacturing and increasing exports. His administration has streamlined regulations and improved ports. Yet despite some high-profile developments like Apple moving the assembly of some iPhones to India, manufacturing makes up only 13 percent of the country’s economy, according to World Bank data. That is a lower share than a decade ago, when Mr. Modi took office. Foreign money has flowed into India’s stock markets, multiplying share prices, a key element of Mr. Modi’s pro-business image. But persuading international investors to put money directly into Indian companies — a riskier bet — has been a harder sell. His Hindu nationalist party has demonized the Muslim minority, a source of social ferment that has raised fears of instability. The election could further discourage additional investment, because Mr. Modi will likely have a more difficult time gaining passage of stalled reforms sought by business, including laws making it easier to amass land and hire and fire workers. With no clear pathway toward economic dynamism and more challenging political circumstances, Mr. Modi might resort to a time-honored method of shoring up support: He will expand social welfare programs, tapping government coffers to hand out more cash to communities in need. Such a course could potentially diminish available funding for the advancement of the government’s signature program — its aggressive construction of highways, ports, airports and other infrastructure. Those plans are central to maintaining India’s strong economic growth and the broader campaign to encourage investment in manufacturing. Some fear that any short-term pursuit of political favor through the scattering of money could undermine the longer-term project of spurring jobs through the promotion of industry. “You need to ensure that the benefits of economic development reach the maximum number of people,” said Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at Global Data.TS Lombard, a forecasting and consulting firm in London. “If people keep depending on welfare and are not getting the benefits of economic development, then it basically just creates stagnation.” Geopolitical alterations appear to give India a fresh crack at growing its manufacturing base. As the United States and China engage in trade hostilities, multinational brands are seeking to reduce their heavy dependence on Chinese factories to make their goods. Major retailers like Walmart are increasingly looking to India as an alternative to China. But capturing that potential investment demands continued upgrading of highways, rail connections and ports, along with a focus on vocational training to give people the needed skills to take up factory work. Even before the election, there were doubts that Mr. Modi’s administration was moving quickly enough to realize these gains. “India is a counterweight to China in terms of geopolitics, and we will continue to see some of that investment flowing,” Ms. Deveshwar said. “But the scale at which they are provisioning the ecosystem for these opportunities just is not large enough.”",indian election

nytimes,The World Heads to the Polls,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/climate/global-elections-climate-change-policy.html,"One of the busiest election cycles in history is coming to an end on Sunday. Hundreds of millions of people have gone to the polls in South Africa, India and Mexico in recent days, and millions more will do the same in the European Union this weekend. As Somini Sengupta has explained in a series of articles this week, among the issues that the new leaders of these countries will face: how to transition away from coal, how to adapt to record-breaking heat and, in Europe’s case, how to address a growing backlash against environmental policies. Today, I want to lay out some the most pressing environmental challenges in these areas, and what the results announced in the past few days point to. Keep in mind that whatever happens in the United States election in November will affect many of these countries, too. The biggest takeaway from India’s elections, as my colleagues who cover the country put it, is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “lost his aura of invincibility.” His Bharatiya Janata Party still won far more seats than any other party, and Modi is set to take up his third consecutive term as prime minister. But his party didn’t win an outright majority and now needs coalition partners to stay in power. Many critics of the current government see the result as good news for democracy, because Modi will be forced to seek support from more moderate allies. It could also bring some relief to activists like Ritwick Dutta, an environmental lawyer whose efforts to defend nature in India have made him a target of the government. But it’s unclear how fewer seats in Parliament will affect Modi’s environmental policies. The main challenges facing the next Indian government are what to do about the effects of climate change, including heat waves that have killed dozens of people. During the elections, at least 33 poll workers were among them, and the heat also closed schools in several states,",one busiest election cycle history coming end sunday hundred million people gone poll south africa india mexico recent day million european union weekend somini sengupta explained series article week among issue new leader country face transition away coal adapt recordbreaking heat europe case address growing backlash environmental policy today want lay pressing environmental challenge area result announced past day point keep mind whatever happens united state election november affect many country biggest takeaway india election colleague cover country put prime minister narendra modi lost aura invincibility bharatiya janata party still far seat party modi set take third consecutive term prime minister party didnt win outright majority need coalition partner stay power many critic current government see result good news democracy modi forced seek support moderate ally could also bring relief activist like ritwick dutta environmental lawyer whose effort defend nature india made target government unclear fewer seat parliament affect modis environmental policy main challenge facing next indian government effect climate change including heat wave killed dozen people election least poll worker among heat also closed school several state,5.0,neutral,0
nytimes,Narendra Modi’s India,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/briefing/modis-india.html,"Narendra Modi has just won re-election as India’s prime minister, though by a far narrower margin than expected. With his third consecutive term, the charismatic strongman has still sealed his position as the country’s most significant leader in generations. Despite having led India for a decade, Modi has in some ways kept his country guessing about his vision. On major issues — India’s relationships, its economy, its society and its government — it’s still unclear what sort of country Modi wants India to be. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain four of the big questions. India has spent recent years deepening its relationship with the United States. It has gotten closer to American allies, including Japan and Australia, and ordered high-end American weapons systems — the kind that create dependence down the road. And it is unlikely to side with China. In 2020, Chinese troops crossed into territory controlled by India and killed 20 soldiers in a skirmish. Modi has kept Beijing at arm’s length since then. But Modi, 73, has signaled that he doesn’t want to be a U.S. ally. Some officials in his inner circle still regard the United States warily. American diplomats complain about New Delhi’s apparent efforts to erode democratic norms and the rights of minority groups. So India keeps its options open. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States tried in vain to persuade India to take a stand against the war. India still processes Russian oil (picking up the slack created by international sanctions). It still buys weapons from Russia. India spent the Cold War trying to position itself as a nonaligned power. Old habits die hard. India recently overtook China as the most populous country and the fastest-growing large economy. Still, most of the country remains poor. Some 800 million people need help filling their stomachs.

nytimes,"In Global Elections, Strongmen Are Taken Down a Notch","June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/world/global-elections-india-turkey-democracy.html,"In India, a powerful leader wins another term but sees his party’s majority vanish. In South Africa, the governing party is humbled by voters for the first time since the end of apartheid. In Britain, a populist insurgent barges into an election that is shaping up to be a crushing defeat for the long-ruling Conservatives. If there is a common thread halfway through this global year of elections, it is a desire by voters to send a strong signal to the powers that be — if not quite a wholesale housecleaning, then a defiant shake-up of the status quo. Even in Mexico, where Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and the handpicked successor of the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was elected in a landslide last Sunday, voters were rewarding the forces that had uprooted the country’s entrenched establishment only six years earlier. With a billion-plus people going to the polls in more than 60 countries, some analysts had feared that 2024 would pose a fateful test for democracy — one that it might fail. For years, populist and strongmen leaders have chipped away at democratic institutions, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of elections, while social media has swamped voters with disinformation and conspiracy theories. In some of the biggest, most fragile democracies, leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey had been regarded as close to invincible, using appeals to nationalism or sectarianism to mobilize supporters and bending institutions to suit their purposes. Yet now, Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan have both had their wings clipped. Soaring inflation, chronic unemployment and uneven economic growth have widened inequality in India, Turkey and elsewhere, frustrating voters who have shown a willingness to buck the establishment. “We do have electoral systems that are producing outcomes the governing parties didn’t want,” said Ben Ansell, a professor of comparative democratic institutions at the University of Oxford. “They’ve all been destabilized by a tricky economic environment, and behaving like strongmen hasn’t saved them.” Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan remain in power, each now in his third term. But Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., lost dozens of seats and will have to govern in a coalition with two secular parties. Turkey’s opposition struck a blow against Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party in April, winning a string of local elections and solidifying its control of important cities like Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. “In a lot of countries where there’s been talk of backsliding, that’s where we’ve seen a bounce back,” Professor Ansell said. “For Modi and Erdogan, taking the sheen off their infallibility was very important.” With so many elections in so many countries, it is dangerous to generalize. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia rolled up 88 percent of the vote in a landslide re-election victory in March that spoke less to Russian public sentiment and more to the ability of an autocrat, facing no meaningful opposition, to stage-manage a show of support for his war in Ukraine. In Europe, far-right parties are expected to perform well in European Parliament elections, which began on Thursday. Analysts said they did not believe this would jeopardize the political center that has governed Europe in the post-World War II era. And Poland provided a source of reassurance last fall, when voters pushed out its nationalist Law and Justice Party in favor of a more liberal opposition. Still, the success of far-right figures like Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy, attests to the enduring appeal of populism. “Populists and right-wingers will continue to make gains and strike fear into the European political establishment,” the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said in its analysis of the top risks of 2024. Britain’s general election was shaken up on Monday when Nigel Farage, a populist politician, pro-Brexit campaigner and ally of former President Donald J. Trump, announced he would run for a seat in Parliament under the banner of his Reform U.K. party, which has a strident anti-immigration message. That will add to the headache for the Conservative Party, which has lagged the opposition Labour Party by double digits in polls for nearly 18 months. Reform, which is fielding candidates across the country, could siphon off Conservative votes among those who blame the party for a weak economy and rising immigration numbers since Britain left the European Union in 2020. Some critics argue that the Conservative Party’s problems stem from its free-market policies, which they say have disillusioned voters in disadvantaged parts of Britain and set it apart from right-wing parties in Europe or Mr. Trump’s Make America Great Again movement in the United States. More fundamentally, though, the Conservatives have been in power for 14 years, and they face the same pent-up dissatisfaction with the status quo that fueled the recent elections in India, South Africa and Turkey. In some countries, the urge to break with the past has led voters to make unorthodox choices: Javier Milei, a flamboyant libertarian economist, swept to power in Argentina last November with a promise to close its central bank and wage an all-out assault on what he described as a corrupt political “caste.” Some analysts argue that similarly disruptive forces are driving the presidential race in the United States, where a comparatively healthy economy and the advantages of incumbency have not spared President Biden, who faces a neck-and-neck challenge from Mr. Trump even after the former president was convicted of multiple felonies. “It’s not about left versus right, it’s about the status quo versus change,” said Frank Luntz, an American political strategist who has lived and worked in Britain. “You can’t buy a house in the U.K., the N.H.S. doesn’t work,” he said, referring to the National Health Service. “In the United States, you can’t afford housing or health care. It’s about broken promises, year after year after year.” That sense of betrayal is even more acute in countries like South Africa, where the African National Congress, or A.N.C., has governed since the start of democracy there in 1994, piling up majorities even as the economy and social infrastructure crumbled. Last week, voters finally rebelled, driving down the A.N.C.’s vote share to 40 percent, from 58 percent in the last national election in 2019. Among their biggest complaints is the lack of job opportunities: South Africa’s unemployment rate — at 42 percent, including those who have stopped looking for work — is one of the highest in the world. Stagnation has widened the country’s already profound inequality. South Africans flock to cities looking for work. But many end up in decrepit buildings and slapdash shack communities, often without running water or sanitary toilets. Regular power outages leave streets dark and residents of many communities vulnerable to crime. South Africa’s murder rate is six and a half times as high as that of the United States and 45 times as high as Germany’s. Jacob Zuma, the scandal-scarred former president, has benefited from this misery, helping start a new party, umKhonto weSizwe, or M.K., which won nearly 15 percent of the vote, mostly at the expense of his former party, the A.N.C. Mr. Zuma attracts a feverish following among disillusioned A.N.C. supporters, who accuse the party of selling out to wealthy white businesspeople and not moving aggressively enough to redistribute wealth to the Black majority after apartheid. India’s election was a comparable anti-incumbent revolt, even if Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. is still the largest party in Parliament by a wide margin. The party’s campaign spending was at least 20 times as much as that of its main opposition, the Congress Party, which had its bank accounts frozen by the government in a tax dispute on the eve of the election. The country’s news outlets have been largely bought off or bullied into silence. And yet, the results showed Mr. Modi, 73, losing his majority for the first time since he took office in 2014. Analysts said that reflected widespread dissatisfaction with how the fruits of India’s economy have been shared. While India’s steady growth has made it the envy of its neighbors — and created a conspicuous billionaire class — those riches have not flowed to the hundreds of millions of India’s poor. The government has handed out free rations of wheat, grain and cooking gas. It offers home water connections, subsidizes building supplies and gives farmers cash. But it has not tackled India’s inflation or unemployment, leaving hundreds of millions of people, especially women, chronically out of work. There is also some evidence that Mr. Modi’s appeals to Hindu nationalism were not as potent as in previous elections. The B.J.P.’s candidate did not even win the constituency that is home to the lavish Ram temple, built on grounds disputed by Hindus and Muslims. Mr. Modi inaugurated the temple just before the campaign started, hoping it would galvanize his Hindu political base. The economy figured into Mexico’s election as well, but in a very different way. While overall growth was disappointing — averaging only 1 percent a year during Mr. López Obrador’s term — the government doubled the minimum wage and strengthened the peso, lifting millions of Mexicans out of poverty. “People vote with their wallets, and it’s very obvious there’s more money in the wallets of almost everybody in Mexico,” said Diego Casteñeda Garza, a Mexican economist and historian at Uppsala University in Sweden. Still, analysts said, there was also a desire among voters to cement the change that Mr. López Obrador, a charismatic outsider, symbolized when he came to power in 2018. Even as Ms. Sheinbaum, 61, vowed to continue her mentor’s policies, she cast herself — Mexico’s first female and Jewish president — as a change agent. For Jacqueline González, 33, who works at a cargo transportation company and viewed Mexico’s previous governments as corrupt, that made voting for Ms. Sheinbaum an easy decision. “With Obrador we have already seen, although some people don’t want to admit it, some change,” Ms. González said. “Let’s hope it continues with Sheinbaum.”",india powerful leader win another term see party majority vanish

nytimes,"Rahul Gandhi, Long on the Ropes, Looks Set for an Unexpected Comeback","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-congress-rahul-gandhi.html,"Just last year, Rahul Gandhi and the once-powerful party he led, the Indian National Congress, seemed to be on the ropes and little threat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s consolidation of political power. Congress had not been a competitive factor in national elections in years, winning fewer and fewer votes each time Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party was elected. And Mr. Gandhi himself had been convicted on a slander charge and barred from holding a seat in Parliament. But on Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi and a broad opposition coalition led by his Congress party registered a far stronger showing than expected in India’s elections, setting the stage for an unlikely comeback. “He has finally arrived,” said Rasheed Kidwai, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi. “This time he has improved his vote share by at least 17 million votes, which is very substantial.” On Wednesday, Mr. Modi’s party announced that it had reached an agreement to form a governing coalition, including two parties that do not necessarily share its vision. Congress won 99 seats in the 543-seat Parliament, a gain of 47 seats, and the alliance of which it is the leading part won a total of 232. Congress and its alliance of over two dozen political groups have presented the results as a “moral victory” over a B.J.P. government that they say was trying to change the country’s Constitution and have portrayed as anathema to India’s identity as a multifaith and secular country. “The fight was to save the Constitution,” Mr. Gandhi, the son, grandson and great-grandson of Congress prime ministers, said as the results poured in. The first major sign that Congress might be able to contend came in May 2023, just a couple of months after Mr. Gandhi’s conviction for slander, when his party won the state government of Karnataka, in the south of India, from the B.J.P. The lift was temporary; Congress soon lost power in three states it governed to the B.J.P. But at the same time, political experts say, Mr. Gandhi was pushing for changes within the party, India’s oldest, which had long resisted overhauling an archaic organizational structure that kept its top leaders isolated from the grass-roots workers who deliver votes. Feelings that Congress’s leaders were corrupt and out of touch resulted in a string of defeats over a number of years and then degenerated into messy infighting within the party. For the past two years, party members say, Mr. Gandhi has tried to reverse the decline of Congress by surrounding himself with young policy analysts to help him understand the challenges facing India, as well as party veterans with their ears to the ground in towns and villages that Congress was targeting. The party has in addition improved its social media game, trumpeting its messages on platforms like WhatsApp and YouTube. Mr. Gandhi also raised his profile by embarking on two walks across India — meeting farmers in their fields and vegetable sellers on city streets; and drinking tea with recent graduates and gig workers — in an effort to show common cause with ordinary people. Perhaps most important, Congress focused on a strategy of reaching out to and cooperating with key regional players across the country whose influence had dimmed under B.J.P. rule. Congress leaders made a series of “seat-sharing” agreements with regional leaders, big and small, that strengthened the alliance against Mr. Modi’s party. To avoid splitting the anti-B.J.P. vote, Congress had its own candidates contest fewer seats. And Mr. Gandhi campaigned vigorously alongside the leaders of like-minded political groups across India. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Gandhi also won support, party leaders say, by characterizing Mr. Modi as a leader who would destroy India’s secular character. “It is a victory not just for him and our alliance partners but for the millions of poor Indians who voted to protect the secular fabric of this country,” said Srinivas B.V., another Congress leader, about Mr. Gandhi. “People showed Modi: ‘You are not God, and you can be replaced.’” Since being voted to power in 2014, Mr. Modi has sought to position Hinduism, the religion of some 80 percent of Indians, at the center of the country’s official identity. He also promised to end corruption, overhaul the economy and help India become a “developed nation” by 2047. But after his re-election in 2019, he leaned into Hindu themes to a greater extent. Mr. Gandhi’s efforts to contrast his vision for India with Mr. Modi’s largely paid off, analysts say, even if some members of his party jumped ship and sided with the B.J.P. Many of the politicians who defected from Congress to the B.J.P. lost their seats, including in West Bengal and Maharashtra, where Congress and its partners did especially well. Throughout the campaign Mr. Gandhi persistently linked Mr. Modi with Gautam Adani, Asia’s richest man, saying the prime minister was working for his tycoon friends, not for the vast majority of Indians who are poor. As if to vindicate this line of attack, over the two days after the election results were announced, the price of Mr. Adani’s flagship stock fell by 14 percent. (It then recovered somewhat on Wednesday.) “People directly correlate Adani Ji with Modi Ji — directly,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters after the results, using Hindi honorifics for the two men. Researchers who traveled across India during the voting said Mr. Gandhi had beaten Mr. Modi on his own turf in many places by focusing on issues like the millions of Indians without jobs and the economic difficulties faced by farmers. He also accused the B.J.P. of governance failures and worked with local political groups fighting for social justice and for the empowerment of lower-caste Indians. Uttar Pradesh, where Mr. Modi made dozens of visits to campaign for local candidates, is one state where the changing fortunes of the two largest political groupings was evident. The state is India’s largest, and accounts for 80 of the Parliament’s 543 seats. The B.J.P. recorded its worst performance there since 2009, in part because Mr. Gandhi was able to craft an alliance with a powerful local leader, Akhilesh Yadav. In addition to the 37 seats picked up by Mr. Yadav’s Samajwadi Party, Congress won six, helped by aggressive campaigning by Mr. Gandhi’s sister, Priyanka Vadra, who helped defeat a former soap-opera actress who had served as a minister in Mr. Modi’s government. The B.J.P. won 33 seats, down from 62 in the previous Parliament. The election results announced on Wednesday have given a major lift to hundreds of thousands of Congress workers across the country, who were growing tired of the internal infighting that has plagued their party for years. Outside Congress headquarters in New Delhi, Bansi Lal Meena, a veteran Congress member from the state of Rajasthan, was exultant about his party’s performance. “In villages and on the ground, the B.J.P. spread lies for years against us — saying that we are anti-Hindu,” he said. “They used my religion as a weapon against me to win votes.” He added: “We will show them now because our people are also in Parliament.”",last year rahul gandhi oncepowerful party led indian national congress seemed rope little threat prime minister narendra modis consolidation political power congress competitive

nytimes,Narendra Modi Fell to Earth After Making It All About Himself,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-election-modi.html,"When everything became about Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, his party and its century-old Hindu-nationalist network were propelled to unimagined heights. On the back of his singular charisma and political skill, a onetime-fringe religious ideology was pulled to the center of Indian life. Landslide election victories remade India’s politics, once dominated by diverse coalitions representing a nation that had shaped its independence on secular principles. But there were always risks in wrapping a party’s fortunes so completely in the image of one man, in inundating a country of many religions, castes and cultures with that leader’s name, face and voice. Voters could start to think that everything was about him, not them. They could even revolt. On Tuesday, Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., fell back to earth. After having promised their biggest election romp yet, they lost more than 60 seats. Mr. Modi will remain in office for a third term, but only with the help of a contentious coalition of parties, some of which are opposed to his core beliefs and want power of their own. With the result, India’s strained democracy appeared to roar back to life, its beaten-down political opposition reinvigorated. And after a decade in which Mr. Modi’s success in entrenching Hindu supremacy had often felt like the new common sense, India is seeing its leader and itself in a new light, and trying to understand this unexpected turn. Most fundamentally, the opposition, newly coalesced for what it called a do-or-die moment as Mr. Modi increasingly tilted the playing field, found a way to use the cult of personality around him to its advantage. Opposition leaders focused on bread-and-butter issues, often at granular levels in particular constituencies. They hammered Mr. Modi over persistent unemployment and stark inequality. But the B.J.P., with Mr. Modi from on high its only spokesman, was often left with just one answer: Trust in “Modi’s guarantee.” “The ‘Modi’s guarantee’ slogan turned out to be our undoing,” said Ajay Singh Gaur, a B.J.P. worker who had campaigned in the party stronghold of Uttar Pradesh, the northern state where Mr. Modi suffered his biggest blow on Tuesday, losing nearly half of the B.J.P. seats. “The opposition made that sound like this was not about him having delivered, or trying to deliver,” Mr. Gaur said, “but about him being an arrogant politician.” Mr. Modi gave his adversaries a lot to work with, even declaring that he may not be “biological” and that he had been sent by God. He has still emerged better so far than other Indian leaders who deeply centralized power. He remains in control of levers of power that could help him and his party restore their dominance. Indira Gandhi, who had also glorified herself and went so far as to suspend India’s democracy after declaring a national emergency, was voted out at the peak of her powers before returning three years later. But Mr. Modi’s B.J.P., the world’s largest political party, finds itself in a tough spot after years of centralization and reliance on a government machinery put to the service of one man, analysts say. The huge advantage the party has built in numbers and resources is undercut by a lack of internal consultation and delegation of authority. That was a key reason for its failure in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, with 240 million people, and surrounding states. Local B.J.P. leaders were disenchanted by a top-down approach toward choosing candidates, as well as what they called a misguided belief that Mr. Modi’s popularity could allow the party to sidestep potent local issues and caste factors. With Mr. Modi sucking up all the oxygen at the top, other senior leaders of the party have been left to fight for relevance and a voice. His relentless self-promotion has also alienated the leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., the B.J.P.’s right-wing fountainhead. During election seasons, the R.S.S. activates its vast grass-roots network in support of B.J.P. candidates. While Mr. Modi, a former foot soldier in the organization, has advanced many of its goals, his consolidation of power goes against its regimented nature and its focus on ideology over individual personalities. One R.S.S. insider, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking, said that Mr. Modi’s exalting of himself had created such resentment inside the group that some of its leaders welcomed any sort of reality check for him, short of his ouster. Sudheendra Kulkarni, a political analyst who served as an aide to the first B.J.P. prime minister in the 1990s, said Mr. Modi had pushed through unpopular legislation — in particular farm laws that prompted a yearlong protest that choked New Delhi — without consulting with party officials in the affected states. They were left to cope with the ramifications. “The B.J.P. was never a one-leader party,” Mr. Kulkarni said. “All that changed with Narendra Modi in 2014. He sought to promote a new authoritarian idea of one nation, one leader.” Hypothesizing that Mr. Modi’s popularity had peaked, the opposition saw an opening to go after a decisive section of votes in the Indian political formula. For decades before his rise in 2014, neither the B.J.P. nor the Indian National Congress, the country’s two largest parties, could muster majorities on its own. Mr. Modi expanded his party’s backing by consolidating right-wing Hindu voters and drawing in new supporters with his personal story of a humble caste and economic background and a promise to change lives through robust development. A decade later, in this year’s election, the opposition found traction in painting a very different picture of Mr. Modi — as an autocratic friend of billionaires. Since Mr. Modi had achieved everything he had set out to do, the opposition argued, his pursuit of a resounding majority could only mean that he would seek radical change to the Constitution. That claim stirred anxiety among India’s Dalits and other underprivileged groups, who see the Constitution as their only protection in a deeply unequal society, guaranteeing them a share of government jobs and seats in higher education as well as elected bodies. The opposition was able to push the message harder when some in Mr. Modi’s right-wing support base, long seen as having an upper-caste bias, called for revoking the quotas. Caste identity was a major driving factor for voters in many states, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, with its 80 parliamentary seats. The decline of a Dalit party in the state meant that about 20 percent of the votes were potentially up for grabs. In Ayodhya, the constituency where Mr. Modi inaugurated a grand Ram temple earlier this year in an effort to consolidate his Hindu support base, the opposition put up a Dalit candidate. He handily defeated the B.J.P.’s two-term incumbent. In other cases, voters showed their anger over the B.J.P.’s perceived sense of impunity. In Kheri, a constituency where the son of a B.J.P. minister rammed his S.U.V. into a crowd of protesting farmers, killing several, the minister also lost. Mr. Modi’s election campaign took its most divisive turn in Banswara, in the desert state of Rajasthan, where he called India’s 200 million Muslims “infiltrators” and raised fears that the opposition would give them India’s wealth, including Hindu women’s necklaces. Banswara’s B.J.P. incumbent was routed in the election. While the loss was most likely attributable to local issues, the national discussion noted that Mr. Modi’s comments had not helped. In his own constituency of Varanasi, in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Modi’s winning margin of nearly half a million votes in 2019 shrank to about 150,000 — a disappointing showing after he had dispatched some of the B.J.P.’s most senior leaders to camp out there to help him achieve an even bigger victory. Jai Prakash, a tea and samosa seller in Varanasi, said some of the prime minister’s work, particularly his improvement of roads, was popular. But Mr. Modi was losing the plot, Mr. Prakash said, by turning to issues disconnected from people’s day-to-day lives. “Prices are skyrocketing; so is unemployment,” Mr. Prakash said. “He has done some good. But people cannot worship him endlessly.”",everything became prime minister narendra modi india party centuryold hindunationalist network propelled unimagined height back singular charisma political

nytimes,"India Keeps Its Glorious, Messy Tradition Alive","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/opinion/india-election-modi-bjp-democracy.html,"Back in January, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India looked all but unstoppable, he visited the small city of Ayodhya for the unofficial start of his campaign to win a third term. The location was freighted with symbolism. For decades, Hindu nationalists had sought to build a temple in Ayodhya, at a spot they believe to be the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. The only problem was that there was already a house of worship on the spot, a mosque built by a Mughal emperor in 1528. A Hindu mob had dismantled the mosque in 1992, setting off riots that killed 2,000 people, most of them Muslims. The ruins were a flashpoint of religious tensions in India for decades. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party promised to build the temple, and the lavish event at which Modi officially opened it was a showcase for that achievement. At the time it seemed like strong election-year messaging for a politician who built his career on the twin planks of Hindu nationalism and building a muscular new India. Unlike other politicians, the event implied, Modi made promises and kept them. “It is the beginning of a new era,” he declared. Feeling supremely confident, Modi had boldly asked the Indian electorate for something akin to a blank check to remake the country — control of 400 seats in Parliament in elections that began in April and concluded on June 1. And why shouldn’t he have been confident? India’s economy was the fastest-growing in the world. India had overtaken China as the world’s most-populous country. World leaders sought Modi’s support on issues ranging from the war in Ukraine to the climate crisis, cementing India’s ascent in global affairs. But the ever unpredictable electorate of the world’s largest democracy responded to Modi’s demand for still more power resolutely: No thanks. In a stunning rebuke, election results released on Tuesday showed that India’s voters have reduced the parliamentary share of Modi’s party by more than 60 seats, not enough for an outright majority, never mind the supermajority he had sought. It struck me as particularly apt that despite all the fanfare about the glorious new temple in Ayodhya, Modi’s party lost the city’s parliamentary seat to a political opposition that had been all but left for dead. There appears to be a clear ceiling to the appeals to Hindu identity on its own. “We are very happy with the temple, but people were fed up with the B.J.P.,” a local business leader, Rakesh Yadav, told Reuters. “People will not always fall for the caste or temple-mosque politics. They also want to see development.” This is a big year for democracy, almost a referendum of sorts on the very idea. Dozens of countries are holding elections, representing roughly half of the world’s population. But authoritarianism has been on the march. The latest report from Freedom House found that by many measures, global freedom has declined for the 18th straight year. India, despite its status as the world’s most-populous democracy, has been a poster child for this decline under Modi: His government has taken aim at just about every form of freedom. He has attacked and grievously weakened the independence of India’s once boisterous press. He has jailed critics and political opponents. He has sharpened religious animosity, referring during this campaign to Muslims, who make up 14 percent of India’s population, as “infiltrators” who seek to steal wealth and power from the Hindu majority. It’s an Indian edition of the nationalist, populist playbook playing out around the world. That a newly unified opposition managed to prevent Modi’s party from winning an outright majority under these conditions took everyone, including me, by surprise. And it suggests that even when would-be authoritarians attempt to tilt the playing field, voters can and will state their will, no matter the autocrat’s preferences. “The B.J.P. had positioned itself as a new hegemonic power,” Yamini Aiyar, a scholar and analyst of Indian democracy who has been a frequent target of Hindu nationalist rage, told me. “The beauty of an election is that politicians have to go to the people, and the people get an opportunity to express their anxieties and their perspectives.” Express them they did. Looking back, the weakness of the B.J.P.’s re-election case is clear: Yes, India’s economy was growing fast. But despite the flashy new infrastructure projects and deals to increase high-tech manufacturing, the growth was not creating nearly enough jobs, and inflation remained stubbornly high, especially for food, which hits the poorest hardest. Much of the wealth generated by growth has gone to India’s richest tycoons, and inequality has soared. “The reality is that the real economy has been hurting for a very long time, and they have systematically sought to ignore it,” Aiyar said. India has managed to lift millions of people out of poverty since Modi came to power 10 years ago, but particularly in rural areas, where most Indians live, that has meant social welfare rather than jobs. There were other issues too — Modi’s allies had floated the idea of changing India’s Constitution in various ways, including removing its commitment to secularism and enshrining Hinduism as the national faith. These kinds of appeals have helped the B.J.P. in the past but seem to have had less power this time around. One clear sign was its heavy losses in Uttar Pradesh, which is not just India’s most populous state; it is also part of the heavily Hindu heartland of northern India. It also seems that the opposition may finally have gotten its act together. India’s main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, has been in decline for years and had struggled to make common cause with other opposition parties in previous elections. But this year the opposition parties managed to make a much stronger coalition. They focused on kitchen table issues and highlighted the Modi government’s ties to big business and high-flying billionaires. The opposition didn’t shy away from making the stakes for Indian democracy clear. But the relentless focus on what voters said mattered most offers lessons for those battling revanchist movements elsewhere, including in the United States. Sometimes you need to meet voters where they are. This vote wasn’t a total rebuke of Modi and his policies. He is all but certain to get his third term as prime minister by making a coalition with allied parties. But it is a clear and salutary check on his authoritarian project. This election is also a rebuke of Indian elites — in business and media especially — who had willingly surrendered to a kind of inevitability of Modi’s long-term consolidation of power, making peace with it or even celebrating it. Activists, analysts and journalists who had the temerity to speak plainly about Modi’s revanchist project and the threat he posed to the world’s biggest democracy and its long history of tolerance, secularism and free speech have been hounded out of public life. I hope that this troubling slide ends now. As the results rolled in on Tuesday, I remembered my own reporting trip to Ayodhya in 2009, when I was a correspondent for The Times based in India. An explosive new government report had just been issued about the destruction of the mosque and the role of Hindu nationalist groups in stirring up violence. But when I got there, I was surprised to find that on the hotly contested spot itself there was hardly any hoopla. The crowds of Hindu nationalist volunteers who for years had routinely shown up to build the temple with their bare hands had disappeared. India was going through a period of hopeful prosperity. Voters had just returned the Indian National Congress party and its allies to power with a larger majority, and a brilliant, teetotaling economist named Manmohan Singh was prime minister. With the future looking so alluring, no one seemed all that interested in litigating the past. These hopes were ultimately dashed amid scandals over political corruption and mismanagement. The Congress party, which once seemed unstoppable, lost power in 2014 for failing to deliver on its promise to bring India to its long-awaited place among the world’s richest and most powerful nations. The years ahead will, with any luck, be ones of negotiation and compromise. This will be a return to form for India, a vastly diverse nation whose unruly polity has resisted autocracy at every turn since it shrugged off British colonial rule in 1947. The whole world should breathe a sigh of relief that India’s voters have spoken, loudly, in favor of continuing that glorious, messy tradition.",back january prime minister narendra modi india looked

nytimes,The New Kingmakers Who Could Make or Break Modi’s Government,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-elections-modi-coalition.html,"After his first two national election victories, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India easily set his own terms, with his Bharatiya Janata Party winning clear majorities. The result was different in this vote. It was still a victory, but one that left him dependent on a host of coalition partners — particularly on politicians from two regional parties who could make or break Mr. Modi’s ability to form a government. Of the more than a dozen parties that make up the B.J.P.’s coalition, known as the National Democratic Alliance, most won just one or two seats, leaving the party in a difficult predicament. On Wednesday, the B.J.P. said it had reached an agreement to form a coalition government that includes those two regional parties — the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United. They will be the biggest junior partners, but they are also avowedly secular and removed from Mr. Modi’s Hindu-nationalist ideology. Cameras on Wednesday followed every word, meeting and movement of the leaders of the two parties, N. Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party, and Nitish Kumar of Janata Dal-United. Their combined 28 seats in Parliament will give the prime minister the votes he needs to stay in power and push through his agenda. Here is what to know about the men who unexpectedly found themselves as kingmakers, and about the parties they lead. Though some of the members of the B.J.P.’s coalition this year share Mr. Modi’s hard-line vision, both the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United are moderate, secular parties that have a diverse support base. Speculation in India was focusing on what terms the men were demanding for their support, which are unlikely to be rooted in ideology. Both Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar are known to be pragmatic, deal-making politicians whose priorities will be practical concessions for their state, or perhaps cabinet positions. Mr. Kumar has earned a reputation in India for his willingness to switch allegiances over the past decade. He has gone between aligning himself with the B.J.P.-led coalition to supporting its rivals no fewer than five times. Most recently, in January, he returned to Mr. Modi’s alliance just 18 months after he’d left it and with just months to go until the election. He has said his switching of political loyalties was in the interest of his state, Bihar. Mr. Naidu has also at times broken with Mr. Modi, cutting ties with the B.J.P. in 2018 and joining forces with its chief rival, Indian National Congress, ahead of the 2019 elections. He has said that his party has aligned with the B.J.P. out of “political compulsion.” Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar have both been in politics for decades, and have been mentioned as potential candidates for prime minister. Mr. Naidu of the T.D.P., based in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, is a technocrat who has aggressively pushed for investment from information technology companies in his region. His policies helped bring high-paying jobs for I.T. professionals and transformed the city of Hyderabad. Mr. Kumar is a nine-time chief minister of Bihar, India’s poorest state, who comes from a homegrown socialist background. He has pushed for more funds for low-caste Hindus, and his alliance with the B.J.P. broadened support for the party in his state.",first two national election victory prime minister narendra modi india easily set term bharatiya janata party winning clear majority result different vote still victory one left dependent host coalition partner particularly politician two regional party could make break mr modis ability form government dozen party make bjps coalition known national democratic alliance one two seat leaving party difficult predicament wednesday bjp said reached agreement form coalition government includes two regional party telugu desam party janata dalunited biggest junior partner also avowedly secular removed mr modis hindunationalist ideology camera wednesday followed every word meeting movement leader two party n chandrababu naidu telugu desam party nitish kumar janata dalunited combined seat parliament give prime minister vote need stay power push agenda know men unexpectedly found kingmaker party lead though member bjps coalition year share mr modis hardline vision telugu desam party janata dalunited moderate secular party diverse support base speculation india focusing term men demanding support unlikely rooted ideology mr naidu mr kumar known pragmatic dealmaking politician whose priority practical concession state perhaps cabinet position mr kumar earned reputation india willingness switch allegiance past decade gone aligning bjpled coalition supporting rival fewer five time recently january returned mr modis alliance month hed left month go election said switching political loyalty interest state bihar mr naidu also time broken mr modi cutting tie bjp joining force chief rival indian national congress ahead election said party aligned bjp political compulsion mr naidu mr kumar politics decade mentioned potential candidate prime minister mr naidu tdp based southern state andhra pradesh technocrat aggressively pushed investment information technology company region policy helped bring highpaying job professional transformed city hyderabad mr kumar ninetime chief minister bihar india poorest state come homegrown socialist background pushed fund lowcaste hindu alliance bjp broadened support party state,23.0,positive,0
nytimes,"Modi se reelige en India, pero pierde mayoría parlamentaria: 4 claves de las elecciones","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/06/05/espanol/elecciones-india-modi.html,"[Estamos en WhatsApp. Empieza a seguirnos ahora] La primera década de Narendra Modi como primer ministro de India ha estado plagada de sorpresas. Ninguna, sin embargo, se comparó con lo que ocurrió el martes por la mañana, cuando Modi ganó su segunda reelección, pero su partido perdió la mayoría en el Parlamento. Con esa derrota, el aire de invencibilidad de Modi también pareció desvanecerse por primera vez desde que asumió el cargo en 2014. Los resultados de las elecciones fueron particularmente interesantes porque, tras casi siete semanas de votaciones en todo el país, las encuestas a pie de urna publicadas pocos días antes del recuento final mostraban que el Partido Popular Indio de Modi ganaría de forma aplastante, como ya había hecho en dos ocasiones anteriores. Sin embargo, el Partido Popular Indio solo obtuvo 239 escaños, muy por debajo de los 272 necesarios para formar gobierno. La alianza de la oposición, liderada por el Partido del Congreso Nacional Indio, obtuvo 235 escaños. Con los 52 escaños obtenidos por los aliados del Partido Popular Indio, Modi seguirá a la cabeza. Pero su atractivo ha disminuido y su liderazgo ha cambiado radicalmente. Cuando Modi llegó al poder en 2014, prometió progreso económico, el fin de la corrupción y la promoción del hinduismo como elemento central de la identidad india. Con todo ello, se presentó como un líder singularmente fuerte, capaz de reunir a sus seguidores para trabajar por la nación. Esto contrastaba con el gobierno anterior. Antes de que Modi fuera elegido por primera vez, India llevaba 25 años gobernada por coaliciones. Los primeros ministros del Partido del Congreso, del Partido Popular Indio y de terceros partidos más pequeños se alternaban para dirigir India por comités. Modi rompió con esa tradición y lideró un nuevo sistema de partido único dominado por el Partido Popular Indio. Como líder, Modi mostró poco interés en compartir el poder. Cuando invalidó la mayor parte del papel moneda de India en 2016, ni siquiera su ministro de Finanzas conocía la decisión de antemano. Cuando decidió imponer la ley marcial en Jammu y Cachemira, el único estado de mayoría musulmana de India, presentó el plan al Parlamento como un hecho, sin pedir su aprobación. Pero esos días han terminado. Los dos mayores partidos que han surgido como nuevos socios de coalición del Partido Popular Indio están liderados por N. Chandrababu Naidu y Nitish Kumar, legisladores veteranos a quienes se conoce como tecnócratas moderados. Es probable que ambos exijan más autoridad en el Parlamento. De hecho, ambos han sido señalados como posibles candidatos a primer ministro, si se produjera otra coalición que no estuviera liderada ni por el Partido Popular Indio ni por el Congreso Nacional Indio. Cuando el martes se dieron a conocer los primeros mapas electorales nacionales que mostraban el número de escaños ganados y perdidos en el Parlamento, se observó una nueva y sorprendente configuración. Los mapas mostraban que el partido de Modi había perdido zonas de territorio en los estados del norte de habla hindi, considerados bastiones del Partido Popular Indio. Al mismo tiempo, el su partido avanzó en regiones que se habían resistido a Modi en el pasado. Perdió decenas de escaños en el estado septentrional de Uttar Pradesh, pero ganó muchos en el estado oriental de Odisha y en el estado meridional de Telangana. La única parte del país que ahora parece unificada por un partido es el “cinturón tribal”, que atraviesa los estados centrales. Sus comunidades relativamente pobres han sido hábilmente puestas en la mira de la política hinduista y los beneficios sociales del Partido Popular Indio. Los inversores de los mercados bursátiles indios de Mumbai respondieron con entusiasmo a las primeras encuestas a pie de urna. El lunes, se lanzaron a la compra, haciendo subir los precios de las llamadas acciones de Modi, aquellas asociadas a las prioridades de gasto del primer ministro o que se cree que se benefician de sus políticas fiscales. Cuando se conocieron los resultados de las urnas, esas acciones se desplomaron. Las acciones del buque insignia del Grupo Adani perdieron cerca del 19 por ciento de su valor en un solo día de cotización. El índice bursátil perdió cerca del 6 por ciento, casi anulando las ganancias de los cinco primeros meses del año. Modi sigue siendo popular entre los magnates de India, pero los inversores deben averiguar qué empresas se beneficiarán del nuevo gobierno. Chris Wood, responsable mundial de estrategia de renta variable del banco de inversión Jefferies, advirtió el año pasado que si Modi perdía, “cabría esperar una corrección del 25 por ciento, si no más”, en el mercado bursátil indio. Históricamente, a las empresas indias les ha ido igual de bien durante los periodos de gobierno de coalición. Por lo tanto, Wood dijo que, incluso sin Modi en el poder, espera que las acciones “se recuperen bruscamente” sobre la base de la fortaleza de la economía del país en su conjunto. Esta nueva era en el Parlamento empezará seguramente con algunas rondas de retribuciones políticas. Los políticos que no hayan conseguido escaños para sus jefes serán despedidos. Es probable que los partidos más pequeños exijan puestos en el gabinete, lo que significará sustituir a miembros del Partido Popular Indio. Habrá que revisar las políticas. ¿Se inclinará India por la exportación de manufacturas, con el objetivo de sustituir a China como la fábrica del mundo? ¿Protegerá ahora a las industrias locales que temen la competencia extranjera? Milan Vaishnav, investigador de la Fundación Carnegie para la Paz Internacional, advirtió que India no puede volver exactamente a la política de coalición que precedió a Modi. Es probable que sus nuevos socios exijan un estilo autoritario similar al que Modi ejerce desde Nueva Delhi.

Esta vez no hubo quejas sobre las máquinas de votación electrónica, ni temores de que India se hubiera convertido en una dictadura bajo el mandato de Modi. En un discurso difícil pronunciado el martes por la noche desde la sede del Partido Popular Indio, Modi calificó las elecciones de “celebración de la democracia”.",estamos en whatsapp empieza

nytimes,Modi Struggles to Stay on Top: 4 Takeaways From India’s Election,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-election-2024-takeaways.html,"Narendra Modi’s first decade as India’s prime minister came with its fair share of surprises. None, however, looked anything like what happened on Tuesday morning when he won his second re-election, but lost his party’s majority in Parliament. With that loss, Mr. Modi’s air of invincibility also appeared to be fading for the first time since he took office in 2014. The election results were especially shocking because, after nearly seven sweaty weeks of voting across the country, exit polls released just days before the final tally showed that Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party would win in a landslide, as it had twice before. Instead, the Bharatiya Janata Party won only 240 seats, well short of the 272 needed to form a government. The opposition alliance, led by the Indian National Congress Party, took 235 seats. With the 52 seats won by B.J.P. allies, Mr. Modi will remain on top. But his allure has been diminished, and his leadership has fundamentally changed. When Mr. Modi came to power in 2014, he promised economic progress, an end to corruption and to promote Hinduism as being central to India’s identity. Through it all, he presented himself as a uniquely strong leader, capable of marshaling his followers to work for the nation. This was in contrast to the previous government. Before Mr. Modi was first elected, India spent 25 years being governed by coalitions. Prime ministers from the Congress Party, the B.J.P. and smaller third parties took turns running India by committee. Mr. Modi broke with that tradition, leading a new single-party system dominated by the B.J.P. As leader, Mr. Modi showed little interest in sharing power. When he invalidated most of India’s paper currency in 2016, not even his finance minister knew about the decision in advance. When he decided to impose de facto martial law on Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state, he presented the plan to Parliament as a done deal, without seeking approval. But those days are over. The two biggest parties that have emerged as the B.J.P.’s new coalition partners are led by N. Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar, veteran lawmakers who are known as technocratic moderates. Both are likely to demand greater authority in Parliament. In fact, both have been eyed as possible candidates for prime minister, if there were to be another coalition led by neither the B.J.P. nor the Congress. When the first nationwide electoral maps showing the number of seats gained and lost in Parliament were revealed on Tuesday, they showed a striking new pattern. The maps showed that Mr. Modi’s party lost swaths of territory across states in the Hindi-speaking north that were considered B.J.P. strongholds. At the same time, the B.J.P. made inroads in regions that had resisted Mr. Modi in the past. He lost dozens of seats in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, but he gained plenty in the eastern state of Odisha and the southern state of Telangana. The only part of the country that now looks unified by one party is the “tribal belt,” which weaves across the central states. Its relatively poor communities have been skillfully targeted by the B.J.P.’s Hindu-first politics and welfare benefits. Investors in India’s stock markets in Mumbai responded eagerly to the early exit polls. On Monday, they went on a buying spree, driving up the prices of so-called Modi stocks, those associated with the prime minister’s spending priorities or thought to benefit from his fiscal policies. When the actual vote results were counted, those stocks came crashing down. Shares in the Adani Group’s flagship stock lost about 19 percent of their value in one day of trading. The blue-chip index lost about 6 percent, nearly wiping out its gains from the first five months of the year. Mr. Modi remains popular with India’s business tycoons, but investors need to find out which companies will stand to benefit from a new government. Chris Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, an investment bank, warned last year that if Mr. Modi were to lose he “would expect a 25 percent correction, if not more” in the Indian stock market. Historically, Indian companies have done just as well during periods of coalition government. So, Mr. Wood said, even without Mr. Modi in power, he expects stocks to “bounce back sharply” based on the strength of the country’s economy as a whole. This new era in Parliament is sure to begin with a few rounds of political retribution. Politicians who failed to deliver seats for their bosses will be shown the door. Smaller parties are likely to demand cabinet positions, which will mean replacing members of the B.J.P. Policies will need to be revised. Will India lean into export manufacturing, aiming to replace China as the world’s factory? Will it move to protect local industries that fear foreign competition? Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, cautioned that India cannot exactly return to the coalition politics that preceded Mr. Modi. His new partners are likely to make demands that match the authoritarian style Mr. Modi exercises from New Delhi. The kind of state leaders he now needs as coalition partners “are just as absolutist as the national government,” Mr. Vaishnav said. They could, for instance, call for federal police agencies to arrest opponents, as Mr. Modi has done. India’s election was the biggest conducted in the history of democracy, with more than 600 million voters casting ballots in six phases. This time, there were no complaints about the electronic voting machines, or fears that India had become a dictatorship under Mr. Modi. In a difficult speech delivered on Tuesday night from the B.J.P. headquarters, Mr. Modi called the election a “celebration of democracy.”",narendra modis first decade india prime minister came fair share surprise none however looked anything like happened tuesday morning second reelection lost party majority parliament loss mr modis air invincibility also appeared fading first time since took office election result especially shocking nearly seven sweaty week voting across country exit poll released day final tally showed mr modis bharatiya janata party would win landslide twice instead bharatiya janata party seat well short needed form government opposition alliance led indian national congress party took seat seat bjp ally mr modi remain top allure diminished leadership fundamentally changed mr modi came power promised economic progress end corruption promote hinduism central india identity presented uniquely strong leader capable marshaling follower work nation contrast previous government mr modi first elected india spent year governed coalition prime minister congress party bjp smaller third party took turn running india committee mr modi broke tradition leading new singleparty system dominated bjp leader mr modi showed little interest sharing power invalidated india paper currency even finance minister knew decision advance decided impose de facto martial law jammu kashmir india muslimmajority state presented plan parliament done deal without seeking approval day two biggest party emerged bjps new coalition partner led n chandrababu naidu nitish kumar veteran lawmaker known technocratic moderate likely demand greater authority parliament fact eyed possible candidate prime minister another coalition led neither bjp congress first nationwide electoral map showing number seat gained lost parliament revealed tuesday showed striking new pattern map showed mr modis party lost swath territory across state hindispeaking north considered bjp stronghold time bjp made inroad region resisted mr modi past lost dozen seat northern state uttar pradesh gained plenty eastern state odisha southern state telangana part country look unified one party tribal belt weave across central state relatively poor community skillfully targeted bjps hindufirst politics welfare benefit investor india stock market mumbai responded eagerly early exit poll monday went buying spree driving price socalled modi stock associated prime minister spending priority thought benefit fiscal policy actual vote result counted stock came crashing share adani group flagship stock lost percent value one day trading bluechip index lost percent nearly wiping gain first five month year mr modi remains popular india business tycoon investor need find company stand benefit new government chris wood global head equity strategy jefferies investment bank warned last year mr modi lose would expect percent correction indian stock market historically indian company done well period coalition government mr wood said even without mr modi power expects stock bounce back sharply based strength country economy whole new era parliament sure begin round political retribution politician failed deliver seat boss shown door smaller party likely demand cabinet position mean replacing member bjp policy need revised india lean export manufacturing aiming replace china world factory move protect local industry fear foreign competition milan vaishnav senior fellow carnegie endowment international peace cautioned india exactly return coalition politics preceded mr modi new partner likely make demand match authoritarian style mr modi exercise new delhi kind state leader need coalition partner absolutist national government mr vaishnav said could instance call federal police agency arrest opponent mr modi done india election biggest conducted history democracy million voter casting ballot six phase time complaint electronic voting machine fear india become dictatorship mr modi difficult speech delivered tuesday night bjp headquarters mr modi called election celebration democracy,13.0,positive,0
nytimes,"Needing Help to Stay in Power, Modi Loses His Aura of Invincibility","June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/modi-india-election.html,"Suddenly, the aura of invincibility around Narendra Modi has been shattered. In an Indian election in which his party’s slogan had promised a landslide victory and Mr. Modi even repeatedly referred to himself as sent by God, the results announced on Tuesday were unexpectedly sobering. Mr. Modi, 73, is set to take up a third consecutive term as prime minister, after the Election Commission gave final confirmation early Wednesday that the parties that make up his coalition had collectively passed the majority mark in Parliament. It is a feat that only one other Indian leader has accomplished, and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., won far more seats than any other party. But instead of a runaway win, the B.J.P. lost dozens of seats. It now finds itself at the mercy of its coalition partners — including one politician notorious for how often he has switched sides — to stay in power, a sharp reversal a decade into Mr. Modi’s transformational tenure. As the results came into view, the country’s stock markets plunged. Opposition parties, newly unified in what they had called an effort to save the country’s democracy, rejoiced. And India, while extending Mr. Modi’s firm hold on power, learned that there are limits to his political potency, even as he made the election, usually fought seat by seat, squarely about himself. Mr. Modi took a more positive view in a statement on X declaring that his coalition had won a third term. “This is a historical feat in India’s history,” he said. For Mr. Modi, a generous reading of the outcome could be that only with his personal push could his party overcome its unpopularity at the local level and scrape by. Or it could be that his carefully cultivated brand has now peaked, and that he can no longer outrun the anti-incumbency sentiment that eventually catches up with almost any politician. How Mr. Modi will react is uncertain — whether he will harden his effort to turn away any challenge to his power, or be chastened by the voters’ verdict and his need to work with coalition partners that do not share his Hindu-nationalist ideology. “Modi is not known as a consensual figure. However, he is very pragmatic,” said Arati Jerath, a political analyst based in New Delhi. “He will have to moderate his hard-line Hindu-nationalist approach to issues. Perhaps we can hope for more moderation from him.” Few doubt, however, that Mr. Modi will try to deepen his already considerable imprint on the country over the next five years. On his watch, India, the world’s most populous nation, has enjoyed newfound prominence on the global stage, overhauled its infrastructure for the needs of its 1.4 billion people, and been imbued with a new sense of ambition as it tries to shed the legacy of its long colonial past. At the same time, Mr. Modi has worked to turn a vastly diverse country held together by a secular democratic system into an overtly Hindu-first state, marginalizing the country’s large Muslim minority. His increasingly authoritarian turn — with a crackdown on dissent that has created a chilling environment of self-censorship — has pushed India’s vociferous democracy closer to a one-party state, his critics say. And the country’s economic growth, while rapid, has mostly enriched those at the top. Mr. Modi rose from a humble background as the son of a tea seller, becoming India’s most powerful and popular leader in decades by building a cult of personality, spending big on infrastructure and welfare, and tilting India’s democratic institutions in his favor. The ultimate goal was to cement his standing as one of the most consequential prime ministers in India’s nearly 75 years as a republic and make the B.J.P. the country’s only plausible national governing force. But the results on Tuesday pointed to a sharp turnaround for India’s beleaguered main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, which had been seen by many as irrevocably weakened after big losses in the previous two elections. The once-dominant Congress, long positioned at India’s political center, struggled for years to find a direction and offer an ideological alternative to the B.J.P. But it and its coalition partners found traction in this election by attacking Mr. Modi’s government over issues like unemployment, social justice and the prime minister’s ties to India’s billionaires. Last year, as Rahul Gandhi, the public face of the Congress party, sought to burnish his standing by leading long marches across India, the B.J.P. ensnared him in a court case that led to his expulsion from Parliament. He was later returned to his seat by India’s highest court, and was set to win re-election on Tuesday. Speaking as early returns came in, Mr. Gandhi, 53, said the fight was not just against the B.J.P. It was also, he said, against all the government institutions that had stood with Mr. Modi in trying to hamstring the opposition through arrests and other punitive actions. “This was about saving the Constitution,” he said, lifting a small copy that he had been carrying with him and displaying during speeches on the campaign trail. Exit polls released on Saturday, after more than six weeks of voting in the world’s largest democratic exercise, indicated that Mr. Modi’s party was headed toward an easy victory. But there had been signs during the campaign that Mr. Modi was worried about the outcome. He crisscrossed the country for more than 200 rallies over about two months and gave dozens of interviews, hoping to use his charismatic appeal to paper over any weaknesses in his party. In speeches, he often veered from his party’s message of a rising India to counter accusations that he privileged business and caste elites. He also abandoned his once-subtle dog whistles targeting India’s 200 million Muslims, instead demonizing them directly, by name. As things stood by nightfall, Mr. Modi would need at least 33 seats from allies to cross the 272 minimum for forming a government. Two regional parties in particular would be kingmakers: the Telugu Desam Party, in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, with 16 seats, and the Janata Dal (United) party in the eastern state of Bihar, with 12. Both parties are avowedly secular, raising hopes among Mr. Modi’s opponents that their influence could slow down his race to turn India’s democracy into a Hindu-first state. Some of Mr. Modi’s biggest losses came in India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh in the north, with about 240 million people. His party leads the state government and had won 62 of the state’s 80 seats in the national Parliament’s lower house in the previous election, in 2019. As counting entered its last stretch in the evening on Tuesday, the B.J.P. was leading in only 33 seats there. In his own constituency, Varanasi, Mr. Modi’s victory margin was reduced from half a million last time to about 150,000. The loss in Faizabad constituency, in particular, told the story of how some of the prime minister’s biggest offerings had struggled to connect with voters. The constituency is home to the lavish Ram temple in Ayodhya, built on grounds disputed between Hindus and Muslims. Its construction was a cornerstone of the nearly century-old Hindu-nationalist movement that had swept Mr. Modi to power. He hoped that its grand inauguration just before the election campaign began would both unite his Hindu support base and bring new supporters into the fold. Some B.J.P. workers said that the party’s flaunting of the temple may have made a large section of Hindus at the bottom of the rigid caste hierarchy uncomfortable. The opposition had painted Mr. Modi as pursuing an upper-caste agenda that denied underprivileged Hindus opportunities to reverse centuries of oppression. “Because of overemphasis on the Ram temple issue, the opposition got united,” said Subhash Punia, 62, a farmer from the state of Rajasthan who supports Mr. Modi and was waiting outside the B.J.P. headquarters in Delhi on Tuesday. To offset potential losses in his Hindi-speaking northern stronghold, Mr. Modi had set a lofty goal for this election: to gain a foothold in the country’s more prosperous south. He broke some new ground in Kerala, a state dominated by the political left and long hostile to his ideology. But overall in the south, he struggled to improve on the 29 seats, out of 129, that his party had won in the previous election. Perhaps the biggest disappointment for the B.J.P. in southern India was that it once again appeared not to have won any of the 40 seats in Tamil Nadu, a state with its own strong cultural and linguistic identity. Mr. Modi had campaigned aggressively there, even visiting one coastal town for two days of meditation as the voting neared its conclusion. “Mr. Modi’s and the B.J.P.’s antics cannot win my Tamil heart,” said S. Ganesan, a waiter at a hotel in Kanniyakumari, the town Mr. Modi visited.",suddenly aura invincibility around narendra modi shattered indian election party slogan promised landslide victory mr modi

nytimes,Modi Will Feel the Heat in a Third Term. And Not Just Politically.,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/climate/modi-climate-india-election.html,"India, the world’s most populous country, is also among the most vulnerable to climate hazards. That’s not only because of the heat and floods that global warming has exacerbated, but also because so many of the country’s 1.4 billion people are vulnerable to begin with. Most people are poor, by global standards, and they have no safety net. Narendra Modi, the Hindu nationalist prime minister who claimed victory Tuesday for a third five-year term, will face major challenges fueled by climate change. The six-week process of voting took place amid a scorching heat wave in several parts of the country. In the northern states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, at least 33 people, including poll workers, died of complications from the heat last week, according to government authorities cited by Reuters. Rohit Magotra, deputy director of Integrated Research and Action for Development, called on national election officials to reschedule elections in the future to avoid such calamities. He pointed out that workers from every political party suffer in the heat, and so do voters, who often have to line up under the sun. “I definitely see the momentum building up, and elections are unlikely to be scheduled in peak summer in future,” said Mr. Magotra, whose organization has advocated heat solutions in Indian cities. The Election Commission this year did set up a task force to monitor weather conditions, but only after voting got underway amid abnormally high temperatures. It also sent election workers a list of heat precautions prepared by the National Disaster Management Agency. However, according to a report published in Scroll, an Indian news site, political-party campaigners were not told to do anything differently because of the heat.",india world populous country also among vulnerable climate hazard thats heat flood global warming exacerbated also many country billion people vulnerable begin people poor global standard safety net narendra modi hindu nationalist prime minister claimed victory tuesday third fiveyear term face major challenge fueled climate change sixweek process voting took place amid scorching heat wave several part country northern state bihar uttar pradesh least people including poll worker died complication heat last week according government authority cited reuters rohit magotra deputy director integrated research action development called national election official reschedule election future avoid calamity pointed worker every political party suffer heat voter often line sun definitely see momentum building election unlikely scheduled peak summer future said mr magotra whose organization advocated heat solution indian city election commission year set task force monitor weather condition voting got underway amid abnormally high temperature also sent election worker list heat precaution prepared national disaster management agency however according report published scroll indian news site politicalparty campaigner told anything differently heat,-11.0,negative,2
nytimes,India’s Stock Market Tumbles on Close-Run Election Result,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-stock-market-election.html,"Traders in Mumbai started the day with a shock as India began tallying votes from a seven-week election and it became clear that the government of Narendra Modi was not doing nearly as well as expected. By the end of trading on Tuesday, the markets were down 6 percent, nearly wiping out the year’s gains. India’s stock market had been on a tear, buoyed by economic growth and confidence that Mr. Modi, the most powerful prime minister in generations, was sure to secure a third term in office. Investors looking to India yearn for political stability and many have done especially well during the first 10 years of Mr. Modi’s pro-business leadership. Even after Tuesday’s decline, the blue-chip Nifty 50 index has nearly tripled since Mr. Modi became prime minister. But the Indian market’s main indexes have entered choppier waters on the way to the election. Some companies, namely those considered “Modi stocks,” fared especially poorly as the election result came into view. The Adani Group’s fortunes were always the most eye-catching. Gautam Adani rapidly became Asia’s richest man, as his infrastructure-oriented businesses worked in harmony with Mr. Modi’s plans for the country. That is, until a short-seller’s report in early 2023 accused the Adani Group of market manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani’s stocks crashed, but within a year, as it became clear that the Indian government and many of the world’s biggest banks would be patient with the companies, they climbed back up. On Tuesday, Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship company, shed 19 percent of its value, putting it halfway between its peak and subsequent trough. Mr. Modi has anyway won enough seats to form a new government, albeit with a much slimmer majority than forecast. Chris Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, an investment bank, last year gamed out an even worse result for Mr. Modi, saying during an investor summit in October that if Mr. Modi were suddenly defeated, “I would expect a 25 percent correction if not more.” Some degree of correction might be welcomed, at least among professional investors. A lot of the market’s recent growth has reflected the influx of small-time local investors buying stocks for the first time. With global investors clamoring for access to India’s long-term prospects, it had become nearly impossible to find bargains. Christine Phillpotts, portfolio manager for emerging markets at Ariel Investments in Chicago, said India had become “the market that everybody loves to love.” That meant there weren’t many opportunities left, even though she agreed that India’s economy would keep growing robustly.

nytimes,Early Election Results Suggest Sharp Turnaround for Indian National Congress,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/indian-national-congress-rahul-gandhi-election.html,"In India’s last general election, in 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party won 303 of 543 parliamentary seats — nearly six times as many as the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress. It was a stinging electoral blow for the Congress, a once-dominant party that has appeared greatly diminished in recent years, and exit polls in this year’s election had not suggested it would fare much better. But early election results on Tuesday indicated a far stronger showing than expected for the Congress. The party and its allies were leading in nearly 230 races, a sharp turnaround that prompted jubilation at the Congress headquarters in New Delhi, where supporters erupted in cheers each time a television channel announced a new lead for one of its candidates. “Whatever the final results, one thing is clear — it is a moral victory for Congress and our leader Rahul Gandhi, and defeat for B.J.P.,” said Robin Michael, a political worker, referring to Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. While there was no indication that Congress and the opposition coalition it leads would scrape together a majority to unseat Mr. Modi, party workers said that they had dented Mr. Modi’s aura of invincibility. They praised Mr. Gandhi, the Congress party’s most prominent figure and a great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first post-independence prime minister. Last year, as Mr. Gandhi sought to burnish his standing by leading long marches across India, the B.J.P. ensnared him in a court case that led to his expulsion from Parliament. He was later returned to his seat by India’s highest court. On Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi was on track to win his parliamentary seat in the southern state of Kerala. The Congress, long positioned at India’s political center, has struggled to find a direction and offer an ideological alternative to the Hindu nationalist B.J.P. It has faced rebellions, infighting and periodic fits of soul-searching over whether to rally behind a new face — only to stick with its dynastic leadership. This year, despite expectations, Mr. Gandhi had set a target of doubling the party’s 2019 tally of 52 seats. By late Tuesday afternoon, it was leading in nearly 100 seats. “We will stop Modi from making a mockery of this country and turning people against each other,” said Sandeep Mishra, a Congress worker at party headquarters. He added: “Indians are fed up with Modi.”",india last general election prime minister narendra modis party parliamentary seat nearly six time many main opposition party indian national congress stinging electoral blow congress oncedominant party appeared greatly diminished recent year exit poll year election suggested would fare much better early election result tuesday indicated far stronger showing expected congress party ally leading nearly race sharp turnaround prompted jubilation congress headquarters new delhi supporter erupted cheer time television channel announced new lead one candidate whatever final result one thing clear moral victory congress leader rahul gandhi defeat bjp said robin michael political worker referring mr modis bharatiya janata party indication congress opposition coalition lead would scrape together majority unseat mr modi party worker said dented mr modis aura invincibility praised mr gandhi congress party prominent figure greatgrandson jawaharlal nehru india first postindependence prime minister last year mr gandhi sought burnish standing leading long march across india bjp ensnared court case led expulsion parliament later returned seat india highest court tuesday mr gandhi track win parliamentary seat southern state kerala congress long positioned india political center struggled find direction offer ideological alternative hindu nationalist bjp faced rebellion infighting periodic fit soulsearching whether rally behind new face stick dynastic leadership year despite expectation mr gandhi set target doubling party tally seat late tuesday afternoon leading nearly seat stop modi making mockery country turning people said sandeep mishra congress worker party headquarters added indian fed modi,24.0,positive,2

nytimes,Modi’s Party May Need Partners to Form a Government,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/modi-bjp-india-government-coalition.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party will likely need help from junior partners to form a government under the rules of India’s parliamentary system, early election results indicated on Tuesday. In a 2019 election that handed Mr. Modi a second consecutive term, his Bharatiya Janata Party won 303 of the 543 seats in Parliament. That was well over the 272 seats it needed to rule on its own. This time, exit polls released over the weekend suggested that the B.J.P. would once again easily win more than 272 seats. But as of early Tuesday afternoon, official voting results indicated that it would win about 240 seats instead. Winning that much support — 44 percent of the seats in Parliament’s lower house — is an impressive feat in India or any other country. And the new math should not prevent Mr. Modi from securing a third consecutive term as prime minister. But the dip in the B.J.P.’s electoral support, far short of Mr. Modi’s goal and his last electoral performance, will likely have political ramifications. At a minimum, the B.J.P. will have to depend more on the junior members of its existing multiparty alliance. Two of the most prominent parties do not share Mr. Modi’s Hindu-first agenda. And if the governing alliance does not win a majority, the B.J.P. will be able to form a government only by adding new partners. It may not come to that. As of Tuesday afternoon the alliance was on track to scrape by with a narrow parliamentary majority — far short of its target of 400 seats, but enough to stay in power with its existing members.",prime minister narendra modis ruling party likely need help junior partner form government rule india parliamentary system early election result indicated tuesday election handed mr modi second consecutive term bharatiya janata party seat parliament well seat needed rule time exit poll released weekend suggested bjp would easily win seat early tuesday afternoon official voting result indicated would win seat instead winning much support percent seat parliament lower house impressive feat india country new math prevent mr modi securing third consecutive term prime minister dip bjps electoral support far short mr modis goal last electoral performance likely political ramification minimum bjp depend junior member existing multiparty alliance two prominent party share mr modis hindufirst agenda governing alliance win majority bjp able form government adding new partner may come tuesday afternoon alliance track scrape narrow parliamentary majority far short target seat enough stay power existing member,27.0,positive,0
nytimes,How Modi Capitalized on India’s Economic Rise,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-election-economy.html,"Ten years after Narendra Modi was first elected prime minister, India’s economy is roughly twice as large. That is what happens when a country grows at 7 percent a year, as India has been doing, on average, since it opened its markets to international competition in 1991. That steady growth has been skillfully repackaged to promote an image of one man’s leadership making it all happen. Along with nationalism and Hindu pride, the idea that Mr. Modi can make the economy move has been central to his appeal since the beginning. And Mr. Modi has burnished India’s economy in ways that count the most with voters: He made visible infrastructure expansions and distributed welfare benefits to the majority of Indians, who remain poor by global standards even as the country’s higher-income groups learn to flex their spending power. Most of the rest of the world — especially the United States and other Western countries that hope to persuade India to join them in constraining China’s and Russia’s strategic ambitions — wants India’s economy to accelerate. Part of that story could be a shift in manufacturing, like the one Apple has underway in South India. And the world’s investment professionals are eager for India’s successes under Mr. Modi to start paying dividends that they can’t find elsewhere. But even the most eager investors can’t overlook some of the problems that confront India as it becomes the world’s newest heavyweight. While Mr. Modi basked in the glow of a successful moon landing and the country’s innovative “digital public infrastructure,” the political opposition tried to speak past him to the frustrated masses who clamor for more and better jobs. The opposition also tried rousing public anger over Mr. Modi’s ties with the country’s biggest tycoons. That seems not to have worked, neither in politics nor in the markets, in the case of Gautam Adani. Last year the billionaire’s empire was accused, with much flash and fury, of stock manipulation. But the claims hardly broke through, and Adani stocks went back to soaring.",ten year narendra modi first elected prime minister india economy roughly twice large happens country grows percent year india average since opened market international competition steady growth skillfully repackaged promote image one man leadership making happen along nationalism hindu pride idea mr modi make economy move central appeal since beginning mr modi burnished india economy way count voter made visible infrastructure expansion distributed welfare benefit majority indian remain poor global standard even country higherincome group learn flex spending power rest world especially united state western country hope persuade india join constraining china russia strategic ambition want india economy accelerate part story could shift manufacturing like one apple underway south india world investment professional eager india success mr modi start paying dividend cant find elsewhere even eager investor cant overlook problem confront india becomes world newest heavyweight mr modi basked glow successful moon landing country innovative digital public infrastructure political opposition tried speak past frustrated mass clamor better job opposition also tried rousing public anger mr modis tie country biggest tycoon seems worked neither politics market case gautam adani last year billionaire empire accused much flash fury stock manipulation claim hardly broke adani stock went back soaring,13.0,positive,0
nytimes,The Heat Wave Scenario That Keeps Climate Scientists Up at Night,"June 3, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/opinion/heat-technology-climate.html,"On a recent Thursday evening, a freakish windstorm called a derecho (Spanish for “straight ahead”) hit Houston, a city of more than two million people that also happens to be the epicenter of the fossil fuel industry in America. In a matter of minutes, winds of up to 100 miles per hour blew out office building windows, uprooted trees and toppled electric poles and transmission towers. Nearly a million households lost power. Which meant that not only was there no light; there was no air-conditioning. The damage from the storm was so extensive that, five days later, more than 100,000 homes and businesses were still marooned in the heat and darkness. Luckily, the day the derecho blew in, the temperature in Houston, a city infamous for its swampy summers, was in the low to mid-80s. Hot, to be sure, but for most healthy people, not life-threatening. Of the at least eight deaths reported as a result of the storm, none were from heat exposure. But if this storm had arrived several days later, perhaps over the Memorial Day weekend, when the temperature in Houston hit 96 degrees, with a heat index as high as 115, it might have been a very different story. “The Hurricane Katrina of extreme heat” is how Mikhail Chester, director of the Metis Center for Infrastructure and Sustainable Engineering at Arizona State University, once put it to me, echoing the memory of the catastrophic 2005 hurricane that struck Louisiana, devastated New Orleans and killed more than 1,300 people. Most people who died in Louisiana during Katrina died from drownings, injuries or heart conditions. But Dr. Chester was using Katrina as a metaphor for what can happen to a city unprepared for an extreme climate catastrophe. In New Orleans, the levee system was overwhelmed by torrential rains; eventually, 80 percent of the city was underwater. What if, instead, the electricity goes out for several days during a blistering summer heat wave in a city that depends on air-conditioning? In Dr. Chester’s scenario, a compounding crisis of extreme heat and a power failure in a major city like Houston could lead to cascading failures, exposing vulnerabilities in the region’s infrastructure that are difficult to foresee and could result in thousands, or even tens of thousands, of deaths from heat exposure in a matter of days. The risk to people in cities would be higher because all the concrete and asphalt amplifies the heat, pushing temperatures in the midafternoon as much as 15 degrees to 20 degrees higher than in surrounding vegetated areas. The derecho that hit Houston was a warning of just how quickly risks are multiplying in our rapidly warming world. As if to prove this point, some 10 days after the Houston blackout, another windstorm knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses in and around Dallas. One of the most dangerous illusions of the climate crisis is that the technology of modern life makes us invincible. Humans are smart. We have tools. Yeah, it will cost money. But we can adapt to whatever comes our way. As for the coral reefs that bleach in the hot oceans and the howler monkeys that fell dead out of trees during a recent heat wave in Mexico, well, that’s sad, but life goes on. This is, of course, an extremely privileged point of view. For one thing, more than 750 million people on the planet don’t have access to electricity, much less air-conditioning. (In India, New Delhi experienced temperatures as high as 120 degrees last week, leading to an increase in heatstroke, fears of blackouts and the possibility of water rationing.) But it is also a naïve point of view, if only because our bubble of invincibility is far more fragile than we know. So what can we expect in a heat Katrina? Last year, researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology, Arizona State University and the University of Michigan published a study looking at the consequences of a major blackout during an extreme heat wave in three cities: Phoenix, Detroit and Atlanta. In the study, the cause of the blackout was unspecified. “It doesn’t really matter if the blackout is the result of a cyberattack or a hurricane,” Brian Stone, the director of the Urban Climate Lab at Georgia Tech and the lead author on the study, told me. “For the purposes of our research, the effect is the same.” Whatever the cause, the study noted that the number of major blackouts in the United States more than doubled from 2015-16 to 2020-21. Dr. Stone and his colleagues focused on those three American cities because they have different demographics, climates and dependence on air-conditioning. In Detroit, 53 percent of buildings have central air-conditioning; in Atlanta, 94 percent; in Phoenix, 99 percent. The researchers modeled the health consequences for residents in a two-day, citywide blackout during a heat wave, with electricity gradually restored over the next three days. The results were shocking: In Phoenix, about 800,000 people — roughly half the population — would need emergency medical treatment for heatstroke and other illnesses. The flood of people seeking care would overwhelm the city’s hospitals. More than 13,000 people would die. Under the same scenario in Atlanta, researchers found there would be 12,540 visits to emergency rooms. Six people would die. In Detroit, which has a higher percentage of older residents and a higher poverty rate than those other cities, 221 people would die. Perhaps we should not be surprised by these numbers. Researchers estimate that in Europe there were 61,672 heat-related deaths in the summer of 2022, the hottest season on record on the continent at the time. In June 2021, a heat wave led to in nearly 900 excess deaths in the Pacific Northwest. And in 2010, an estimated 56,000 Russians died during a record summer heat wave. The hotter it gets, the more difficult it is for our bodies to cope, raising the risk of heatstroke and other heat illnesses. And it is getting hotter across the planet. Last year was the warmest year on record, and the 10 hottest years have all occurred in the last decade. In the study simulating a heat wave in those three cities, researchers found that the much larger death toll in Phoenix was explained by two factors. First, the temperatures modeled during a heat wave in Phoenix (90 to 113 degrees) were much higher than the temperatures in Atlanta (77 to 97 degrees) or Detroit (72 to 95 degrees), which have historically had milder heat waves. And second, the greater availability of air-conditioning in Phoenix means the risks from a power failure during a heat wave are much higher. A lot can be done to reduce these risks. Building cities with less concrete and asphalt and more parks and trees and access to rivers and lakes would help. So would a more sophisticated nationally standardized heat wave warning system. Major cities also need to identify the most vulnerable residents and develop targeted emergency response plans and long-term heat management plans. Making the grid itself more resilient is equally important. Better digital firewalls at grid operation centers thwart hacker intrusions. Burying transmission lines protects them from storms. Batteries to store electricity for emergencies are increasingly inexpensive. But the hotter it gets, the more vulnerable the grid becomes, even as demand for electricity spikes because customers are running their air-conditioning full throttle. Transmission lines sag, transformers explode, power plants fail. One 2016 study found the potential for cascading grid failures across Arizona to increase thirtyfold in response to a 1.8 degree rise in summer temperatures. “Most of the problems with the grid on hot days come from breakdowns at power plants or on the grid caused by the heat itself, or from the difficulty of meeting high demand for cooling,” Doug Lewin, a grid expert and author of the Texas Energy and Power newsletter, told me. The best way to fix that, Mr. Lewin argued, is to encourage people to reduce power demand in their homes with high efficiency heat pumps, better insulation and smart thermostats, and to generate their own power with solar panels and battery storage. The looming threat of a heat Katrina is a reminder of how technological progress creates new risks even as it solves old ones. On a brutally hot day during a recent trip to Jaipur, India, I visited an 18th-century building that had an indoor fountain, thick walls and a ventilation system to channel the wind through each room. There was no air-conditioning, but the building was as cool and comfortable as a new office tower in Houston. Air-conditioning may indeed be a modern necessity that many of us who live in hot parts of the world can’t survive without. But it is also a technology of forgetting. Once upon a time, people understood the dangers of extreme heat and designed ways to live with it. And now, as temperatures rise as a result of our hellbent consumption of fossil fuels, tens of thousands of lives may depend on remembering how that was done. Or finding better ways to do it.",recent thursday evening freakish windstorm called derecho spanish straight ahead hit houston city two million people also happens epicenter fossil fuel industry

nytimes,"As Voting Ends in India, Modi Awaits a Verdict on His 10 Years in Power","June 1, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/world/asia/india-election-modi.html,"Voting in India’s general election, a six-week-long referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decade in power, came to a close on Saturday as much of the country’s populous north was gripped by a deadly heat wave. Results will be tallied and announced on Tuesday. Mr. Modi, his power deeply entrenched, is seen as likely to win a third consecutive term as prime minister, which would make him only the second leader in India’s nearly 75 years as a republic to achieve that feat. Exit polls released after the last round of voting suggested a comfortable return for his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. A newly united opposition has put up a fight, rallying against Mr. Modi’s divisive politics and management of India’s deeply unequal economic growth. But the exit polls indicated it was struggling to significantly cut into the sizable majority in the 543-seat Parliament held by Mr. Modi’s party. In a message of thanks after the voting closed, Mr. Modi expressed confidence that “the people of India have voted in record numbers to re-elect” his government. But Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the largest opposition party, the Indian National Congress, played down the exit polls as “government surveys” and said the official results will show that his alliance was ahead. The election, held in phases over a month and a half, is the largest democratic exercise in the world, with more than 950 million eligible voters. The last stretch of the campaigning drew large rallies even as northern India baked under an intense heat wave, with temperatures frequently exceeding 110 degrees Fahrenheit, or more than 43 degrees Celsius. At least 19 poll workers have died from heat strokes or other health complications resulting from the heat in recent days. Elections in a parliamentary system like India’s are usually fought seat by seat, with a candidate’s fate determined by local economic and social factors. But the B.J.P. made its parliamentary campaign into a presidential-style referendum, putting the focus almost entirely on Mr. Modi and his leadership. The party hoped that Mr. Modi’s deep popularity would help it overcome a growing anti-incumbent sentiment 10 years into the B.J.P.’s rule. Mr. Modi held about 200 rallies across the country over more than two months of campaigning, hoping to lift up struggling candidates in his party. He also went on a media blitz, giving about 80 interviews to television stations and newspapers, almost all of them friendly to him. As the campaigning ended and a mandatory two-day election pause was set to begin, Mr. Modi retreated south to the memorial of one of India’s most celebrated monks for two days of meditation. The country’s media followed. The stream of videos and photos put out by his office, shot from multiple angles in a place where photography is usually not allowed, led the nightly news and television debates. Mr. Modi’s opponents cried foul, saying that the exercise amounted to prohibited campaigning — and that it exemplified the uneven playing field he has created. “The weather is good. The prime minister is sitting in meditation there and he has mellowed the sun goddess,” Ravi Kishan, an actor and B.J.P. candidate, told local media outlets. “This is historic — amidst intense heat, the wind started blowing today.” The opposition, hamstrung by arrests and other punitive actions as part of a crackdown, still mustered its most united front in years. Opposition leaders painted Mr. Modi as a friend to billionaires who has struggled to create jobs for the country’s large youth population. They called his party elitist, accusing it of not lifting up those in the middle and lower ends of India’s caste system. The opposition has stoked fears that if the B.J.P. remained in power, it might change the country’s Constitution to do away with affirmative action for middle and lower castes, a system put in place many decades ago to address centuries of oppression in India’s rigidly hierarchical society. Mr. Modi has vehemently rejected the charges as unfounded; the party under him has increased its outreach to lower castes. To try to keep his Hindu support base united, he turned to anti-Muslim rhetoric, leveling attacks that were unusually direct for him in recent years. The opposition has also tried to win over voters by promising a long list of welfare offerings, including the waiving of farmers’ loans, cash transfers for women and paid apprenticeships for the young. Mr. Modi, on the other hand, has stuck to an image of fiscal prudence, only highlighting his existing offerings. That, his party members say, was because he was confident of winning a third term, and he did not want to over-promise. But even though the opposition seemed to gain some traction, it faces an uphill task in unseating Mr. Modi’s government. He has built a huge electoral advantage with a robust and well-funded political machinery. In the last election, Mr. Modi’s party won 303 seats, nearly six times as many as its closest national competitor, the Indian National Congress party.",voting india general election sixweeklong referendum prime minister narendra modis decade power came close saturday much country populous north gripped deadly heat wave result tallied announced tuesday mr modi power deeply entrenched seen likely win third consecutive term prime minister would make second leader india nearly year republic achieve feat exit poll released last round voting suggested comfortable return hindunationalist bharatiya janata party bjp newly united opposition put fight rallying mr modis divisive politics management india deeply unequal economic growth exit poll indicated struggling significantly cut sizable majority seat parliament held mr modis party message thanks voting closed mr modi expressed confidence people india voted record number reelect government mallikarjun kharge president largest opposition party indian national congress played exit poll government survey said official result show alliance ahead election held phase month half largest democratic exercise world million eligible voter last stretch campaigning drew large rally even northern india baked intense heat wave temperature frequently exceeding degree fahrenheit degree celsius least poll worker died heat stroke health complication resulting heat recent day election parliamentary system like india usually fought seat seat candidate fate determined local economic social factor bjp made parliamentary campaign presidentialstyle referendum putting focus almost entirely mr modi leadership party hoped mr modis deep popularity would help overcome growing antiincumbent sentiment year bjps rule mr modi held rally across country two month campaigning hoping lift struggling candidate party also went medium blitz giving interview television station newspaper almost friendly campaigning ended mandatory twoday election pause set begin mr modi retreated south memorial one india celebrated monk two day meditation country medium followed stream video photo put office shot multiple angle place photography usually allowed led nightly news television debate mr modis opponent cried foul saying exercise amounted prohibited campaigning exemplified uneven playing field created weather good prime minister sitting meditation mellowed sun goddess ravi kishan actor bjp candidate told local medium outlet historic amidst intense heat wind started blowing today opposition hamstrung arrest punitive action part crackdown still mustered united front year opposition leader painted mr modi friend billionaire struggled create job country large youth population called party elitist accusing lifting middle lower end india caste system opposition stoked fear bjp remained power might change country constitution away affirmative action middle lower caste system put place many decade ago address century oppression india rigidly hierarchical society mr modi vehemently rejected charge unfounded party increased outreach lower caste try keep hindu support base united turned antimuslim rhetoric leveling attack unusually direct recent year opposition also tried win voter promising long list welfare offering including waiving farmer loan cash transfer woman paid apprenticeship young mr modi hand stuck image fiscal prudence highlighting existing offering party member say confident winning third term want overpromise even though opposition seemed gain traction face uphill task unseating mr modis government built huge electoral advantage robust wellfunded political machinery last election mr modis party seat nearly six time many closest national competitor indian national congress party,29.0,positive,0
nytimes,A Small Army Combating a Flood of Deepfakes in India’s Election,"June 1, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/world/asia/india-election-deepfakes.html,"Through the middle of a high-stakes election being held during a mind-melting heat wave, a blizzard of confusing deepfakes blows across India. The variety seems endless: A.I.-powered mimicry, ventriloquy and deceptive editing effects. Some of it is crude, some jokey, some so obviously fake that it could never be expected to be seen as real. The overall effect is confounding, adding to a social media landscape already inundated with misinformation. The volume of online detritus is far too great for any election commission to track, let alone debunk. A diverse bunch of vigilante fact-checking outfits have sprung up to fill the breach. While the wheels of law grind slowly and unevenly, the job of tracking down deepfakes has been taken up by hundreds of government workers and private fact-checking groups based in India. “We have to be ready,” said Surya Sen, a forestry officer in the state of Karnataka who has been reassigned during the election to manage a team of 70 people hunting down deceptive A.I.-generated content. “Social media is a battleground this year.” When Mr. Sen’s team finds content they believe is illegal, they tell social media platforms to take it down, publicize the deception or even ask for criminal charges to filed. Celebrities have become familiar fodder for politically pointed tricks, including Ranveer Singh, a star in Hindi cinema. During a videotaped interview with an Indian news agency at the Ganges River in Varanasi, Mr. Singh praised the powerful prime minister, Narendra Modi, for celebrating “our rich cultural heritage.” But that is not what viewers heard when an altered version of the video, with a voice that sounded like Mr. Singh’s and a nearly perfect lip sync, made the rounds on social media. “We call these lip-sync deepfakes,” said Pamposh Raina, who leads the Deepfakes Analysis Unit, a collective of Indian media houses that opened a tip line on WhatsApp where people can send suspicious videos and audio to be scrutinized. She said the video of Mr. Singh was a typical example of authentic footage edited with an A.I.-cloned voice. The actor filed a complaint with the Mumbai police’s Cyber Crime Unit. In this election, no party has a monopoly on deceptive content. Another manipulated clip opened with authentic footage showing Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Modi’s most prominent opponent, partaking in the mundane ritual of swearing himself in as a candidate. Then it was layered with an A.I.-generated audio track. Mr. Gandhi did not actually resign from his party. This clip contains a personal dig, too, making Mr. Gandhi seem to say that he could “no longer pretend to be Hindu.” Mr. Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, which exit polls on Saturday showed had a comfortable lead, presents itself as a defender of the Hindu faith, and its opponents as traitors or impostors. Sometimes, political deepfakes veer into the supernatural. Dead politicians have a way of coming back to life via uncanny, A.I.-generated likenesses that endorse the real-life campaigns of their descendants. In a video that appeared a few days before voting began in April, a resurrected H. Vasanthakumar, who died of Covid-19 in 2020, spoke indirectly about his own death and blessed his son Vijay, who is running for his father’s former parliamentary seat in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. This apparition followed an example set by two other deceased titans of Tamil politics, Muthuvel Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa Jayaram. Mr. Modi’s government has been framing laws that are supposed to protect Indians from deepfakes and other kinds of misleading content. An “IT Rules” act of 2021 makes online platforms, unlike in the United States, responsible for all kinds of objectionable content, including impersonations intended to cause insult. The Internet Freedom Foundation, an Indian digital rights group, which has argued that these powers are far too broad, is tracking 17 legal challenges to the law. But the prime minister himself seems receptive to some kinds of A.I.-generated content. A pair of videos produced with A.I. tools show two of India’s biggest politicians, Mr. Modi and Mamata Banerjee, one of his staunchest opponents, emulating a viral YouTube video of the American rapper Lil Yachty doing “the HARDEST walk out EVER.” Mr. Modi shared the video on X, saying such creativity was “a delight.” Election officers like Mr. Sen in Karnataka called it political satire: “A Modi rock star is fine and not a violation. People know this is fake.” The police in West Bengal, where Ms. Banerjee is the chief minister, sent notices to some people for posting “offensive, malicious and inciting” content. On the hunt for deepfakes, Mr. Sen said his team in Karnataka, which works for a state government controlled by the opposition, vigilantly scrolls through social media platforms like Instagram and X, searching for keywords and repeatedly refreshing the accounts of popular influencers. The Deepfakes Analysis Unit has 12 fact-checking partners in the media, including a couple that are close to Mr. Modi’s national government. Ms. Raina said her unit works with external forensics labs, too, including one at the University of California, Berkeley. They use A.I.-detection software such as TrueMedia, which scans media files and determines whether they should be trusted. Some tech-savvy engineers are refining A.I.-forensic software to identify which portion of a video was manipulated, all the way down to individual pixels. Pratik Sinha, a founder of Alt News, the most venerable of India’s independent fact-checking sites, said that the possibilities of deepfakes had not yet been fully harnessed. Someday, he said, videos could show politicians not only saying things they did not say but also doing things they did not do. Dr. Hany Farid has been teaching digital forensics at Berkeley for 25 years and collaborates with the Deepfakes Analysis Unit on some cases. He said that while “we’re catching the bad deepfakes,” if more sophisticated fakes entered the arena, they might go undetected. In India as elsewhere, the arms race is on, between deepfakers and fact-checkers — fighting from all sides. Dr. Farid described this as “the first year I would say we have really started to see the impact of A.I. in interesting and more nefarious ways.”",middle highstakes election held mindmelting heat wave blizzard confusing deepfakes blow across india variety seems endless aipowered mimicry ventriloquy deceptive editing effect crude jokey obviously fake could never expected seen real overall effect confounding adding social medium landscape already inundated misinformation volume online detritus far great election commission track let alone debunk diverse bunch vigilante factchecking outfit sprung fill breach wheel law grind slowly unevenly job tracking deepfakes taken hundred government worker private factchecking group based india ready said surya sen forestry officer state karnataka reassigned election manage team people hunting deceptive aigenerated content social medium battleground year mr sen team find content believe illegal tell social medium platform take publicize deception even ask criminal charge filed celebrity become familiar fodder politically pointed trick including ranveer singh star hindi cinema videotaped interview indian news agency ganges river varanasi mr singh praised powerful prime minister narendra modi celebrating rich cultural heritage viewer heard altered version video voice sounded like mr singhs nearly perfect lip sync made round social medium call lipsync deepfakes said pamposh raina lead deepfakes analysis unit collective indian medium house opened tip line whatsapp people send suspicious video audio scrutinized said video mr singh typical example authentic footage edited aicloned voice actor filed complaint mumbai police cyber crime unit election party monopoly deceptive content another manipulated clip opened authentic footage showing rahul gandhi mr modis prominent opponent partaking mundane ritual swearing candidate layered aigenerated audio track mr gandhi actually resign party clip contains personal dig making mr gandhi seem say could longer pretend hindu mr modis governing bharatiya janata party exit poll saturday showed comfortable lead present defender hindu faith opponent traitor impostor sometimes political deepfakes veer supernatural dead politician way coming back life via uncanny aigenerated likeness endorse reallife campaign descendant video appeared day voting began april resurrected h vasanthakumar died covid spoke indirectly death blessed son vijay running father former parliamentary seat southern state tamil nadu apparition followed example set two deceased titan tamil politics muthuvel karunanidhi jayalalithaa jayaram mr modis government framing law supposed protect indian deepfakes kind misleading content rule act make online platform unlike united state responsible kind objectionable content including impersonation intended cause insult internet freedom foundation indian digital right group argued power far broad tracking legal challenge law prime minister seems receptive kind aigenerated content pair video produced ai tool show two india biggest politician mr modi mamata banerjee one staunchest opponent emulating viral youtube video american rapper lil yachty hardest walk ever mr modi shared video x saying creativity delight election officer like mr sen karnataka called political satire modi rock star fine violation people know fake police west bengal m banerjee chief minister sent notice people posting offensive malicious inciting content hunt deepfakes mr sen said team karnataka work state government controlled opposition vigilantly scroll social medium platform like instagram x searching keywords repeatedly refreshing account popular influencers deepfakes analysis unit factchecking partner medium including couple close mr modis national government m raina said unit work external forensics lab including one university california berkeley use aidetection software truemedia scan medium file determines whether trusted techsavvy engineer refining aiforensic software identify portion video manipulated way individual pixel pratik sinha founder alt news venerable india independent factchecking site said possibility deepfakes yet fully harnessed someday said video could show politician saying thing say also thing dr hany farid teaching digital forensics berkeley year collaborates deepfakes analysis unit case said catching bad deepfakes sophisticated fake entered arena might go undetected india elsewhere arm race deepfakers factcheckers fighting side dr farid described first year would say really started see impact ai interesting nefarious way,-13.0,negative,2

She was 75. Her death, in a hospital, was caused by cancer, her assistant, Usha Rabha, said in an interview. (They were not related.) So-called witch hunting has been a scourge throughout India, preying on mostly village women who are often single, widowed or otherwise isolated and involved in property or marital disputes. Accused of being witches, they have been tortured and in many cases murdered; from 2010 to 2021, more than 1,500 were killed in India, according to the country’s National Crime Records Bureau. Ms. Rabha, a slight, bespectacled woman who was born poor in an Assam village, faced down mobs for her work, badgered the police and pushed for legal protection for women. Her efforts were rewarded when legislation outlawing witch hunting was passed in Assam State in 2015. Cases there have dropped sharply, to a few per year from the several a month that were being reported when she began her campaign in the early 2000s, said Usha Rabha, who worked at Mission Birubala, the nongovernmental organization that Birubala Rabha founded. The victims of witch hunts face gruesome punishments, according to “Contemporary Practices of Witch Hunting,” a 2015 report by the Indian legal nonprofit Partners for Law in Development. They can be subjected to “forcible stripping,” the report said, “being paraded naked in public, cutting or tonsuring of the hair, blackening of the face, cutting off of the nose, pulling of the teeth to ‘defang’, gouging out the eye, whipping, gang rape, forcible consumption of human excreta, cow dung” or “killing by hanging, hacking, lynching or burying alive.” Ms. Rabha traveled from village to village in Assam to speak out against the practice and declared that there was no such thing as “daini,” or witches. She had long been suspicious of folk superstitions and of medicine men who chanted incantations over young women to drive out what they believed were evil spirits. As a young mother, Ms. Rabha was told by a local medicine man that her mentally ill son would soon die; he didn’t. That false prediction, in the 1980s, was the seed for her advocacy work, which she began in earnest around 2000.",birubala rabha indian social activist fought practice branding woman witch country remote northeast died may guwahati capital assam state region death hospital caused cancer assistant usha rabha said interview related socalled witch hunting scourge throughout india preying mostly village woman often single widowed otherwise isolated involved property marital dispute accused witch tortured many case murdered killed india according country national crime record bureau m rabha slight bespectacled woman born poor assam village faced mob work badgered police pushed legal protection woman effort rewarded legislation outlawing witch hunting passed assam state case dropped sharply per year several month reported began campaign early said usha rabha worked mission birubala nongovernmental organization birubala rabha founded victim witch hunt face gruesome punishment according contemporary practice witch hunting report indian legal nonprofit partner law development subjected forcible stripping report said paraded naked public cutting tonsuring hair blackening face cutting nose pulling teeth defang gouging eye whipping gang rape forcible consumption human excreta cow dung killing hanging hacking lynching burying alive m rabha traveled village village assam speak practice declared thing daini witch long suspicious folk superstition medicine men chanted incantation young woman drive believed evil spirit young mother m rabha told local medicine man mentally ill son would soon die didnt false prediction seed advocacy work began earnest around,-43.0,negative,2
nytimes,"Overlooked No More: Hansa Mehta, Who Fought for Women’s Equality in India and Beyond","May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/obituaries/hansa-mehta-overlooked.html,"This article is part of Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times. Human rights has long been considered a Western concept, but recent scholarship has been uncovering the influence of women from the global south. Women like Hansa Mehta. Mehta stood up against the British government during India’s struggle for independence. She campaigned for women’s social and political equality and their right to an education. And she fought for her ideals during the framing of the constitution for a newly independent India. For Mehta, women’s rights were human rights. This conviction was best exemplified at a 1947 meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, to which she had been appointed as one of just two women delegates, alongside Eleanor Roosevelt. Mehta boldly objected to the wording of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the commission was tasked with framing. It read: “All men are born free and equal in dignity and rights, they are endowed by nature with reason and conscience, and should act towards one another like brothers.” Mehta pointed out that the phrase “all men” was out of date and could be interpreted to exclude women. Roosevelt countered that the use of the word “men” was “generally accepted to include all human beings,” according to minutes of the meeting. But Mehta — a soft-spoken, slight woman who dressed in traditional saris — held her ground, insisting that the language should be changed to “human beings.” The declaration was adopted with her suggestion the next year, and it has been used as the foundation for treaties around the world. Two years earlier, Mehta was one of three women who drafted the Indian Women’s Charter of Rights and Duties, which affirmed that women have equal rights to education, suffrage, pay and distribution of property, as well as the same rights as men in marriage and divorce. When the panel that became the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in 1946 was forming its guiding principles, it turned to her ideas. In her work for the U.N., as in all her endeavors, Mehta took women’s participation in public and political realms to new heights. Hansa Mehta was born on July 3, 1897, in Surat (now in the northwestern state of Gujarat), to Harshadagauri and Manubhai Mehta. Her father, Manubhai, was a philosophy professor at Baroda College (now Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda); he later became the prime minister of the state of Baroda. Hansa’s paternal grandfather, Nandshankar Mehta, was headmaster of an English-language school, a civil servant and the author of the historical novel “Karan Ghelo”(1866), about the 13th-century ruler of Gujarat whose foolishness resulted in the loss of his kingdom. It is considered the first novel written in the Gujarati language. “I was fortunate enough to be born in a family which had liberal ideas on all questions of life,” Mehta said in 1972 in an oral history at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library in New Delhi. At a time when she estimated that only 2 percent of Indian women were literate, Mehta attended a high school for girls that had been set up by Baroda’s progressive ruler. She read widely, including novels by Sir Walter Scott and James Fenimore Cooper. She was one of a handful of young women to receive a bachelor’s degree, hers in philosophy, from Baroda College. Mehta continued her education in England, where she met the poet and political activist Sarojini Naidu. Naidu took her under her wing and brought her to the International Woman Suffrage Alliance conference in Geneva in 1920. Naidu “made me do things I otherwise would not have dreamt of doing,” like speaking in public, Mehta wrote in “Indian Woman,” a 1981 collection of her essays. In 1923, she traveled alone to the United States, a rare undertaking for women at the time, and visited colleges and universities to learn about American women’s education. She met Mohandas K. Gandhi when he was in jail in India in the 1920s, and in 1930 she responded to his call for women to join the freedom movement. She picketed stores that sold English rather than Indian-made cloth and helped lead protests, landing in jail three times. As a founder of the All India Women’s Conference, and later its president, Mehta tied the political struggle for India’s independence with the fight to improve the condition of her countrywomen. “If we wish to build up a democratic state, it will not pay the state to keep half the number of its citizens uneducated,” she wrote in “Indian Woman.” But she opposed special quotas; she wanted to level the playing field between men and women. Mehta was appointed to the Commission on the Status of Women in 1946 and to the Commission on Human Rights in 1947 — the same year that India gained its independence — and served until 1952. In 1946, she was one of about 15 women to join India’s Constituent Assembly, which met to write a constitution for the new nation. As an assembly member she lobbied for a civil code that would eventually supersede religious laws and ensure gender equality, and she strengthened the language on what are known as “directive principles” — guidelines that are unenforceable by the courts but nonetheless crucial in governing a multiethnic and multireligious secular democracy. In 1924, Mehta married Jivraj Mehta (a common surname in India), the chief medical officer in Baroda. The marriage was regarded as controversial because he was of a lower caste. She said in her oral history that her own community wanted to expel her from her caste, “but then I told them I was going out of the caste myself, as I did not believe in caste.” She and her husband had two children. He became the first chief minister of Gujarat in 1960 and, in 1963, the Indian high commissioner to the United Kingdom, a post equivalent to an ambassadorship. Mehta was vice chancellor of the Shreemati Nathibai Damodar Thackersey Women’s University (commonly known as S.N.D.T.) from 1946 to 1948 and vice chancellor of the University of Baroda from 1949 to 1958. At Baroda, she was the first woman to hold that title at an Indian coed university. The library there is named after her. In 2021, the U.N. held the inaugural Dr. Hansa Mehta Dialogue, a discussion on the fundamental importance of women’s empowerment. Throughout her life, Mehta wrote essays and translated stories and plays into Gujarati. She died at 98 on April 4, 1995. In the oral history, when she was asked why India, although it was largely conservative in its attitude toward women, had more women in the public and political sphere than many Western nations, Mehta spoke of Shakti, the female personification of divine power. “Historical reasons,” she replied, “because from the beginning we have always considered woman as a competent person. ‘Shakti’ — she is always worshiped as ‘Shakti.’” Radha Vatsal’s historical novel “No. 10 Doyers Street,” about a woman journalist from India who becomes embroiled in the case of a Chinatown gangster in 1900s New York,

nytimes,A Matter of Survival as South Asia’s Heat Wave Reaches 127 Degrees,"May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/world/asia/pakistan-india-heat-wave.html,"As South Asia bakes under a blistering heat wave, life-or-death decisions arrive with the midday sun. Abideen Khan and his 10-year-old son need every penny of the $3.50 a day they can make molding mud into bricks at a kiln under the open sky in Jacobabad, a city in southern Pakistan. But as temperatures have soared as high as 126 degrees Fahrenheit, or 52 degrees Celsius, in recent days, they have been forced to stop by 1 p.m., cutting their earnings in half. “This isn’t heat,” said Mr. Khan, sweat dripping down his face and soaking through his worn clothes. “It’s a punishment, maybe from God.” It is yet another brutal summer in the age of climate change, in a part of the world that is among the most vulnerable to its dire effects. And there is more suffering to come: The extreme heat that Pakistan and neighboring India have been experiencing will continue for days or weeks, forecasters say. Already, it has exacted a deadly toll. In the northern Indian state of Bihar, officials said that at least 14 people had died from the heat. Reports from other states in India’s north indicate that the count could be considerably higher. In both India and Pakistan, hospitals have reported large numbers of heatstroke cases. Ten of those who have died in Bihar were poll workers preparing for the voting to be held in the state on Saturday, the final day of India’s national election. To mitigate the heat, glucose and electrolytes are being distributed to polling officers, tents are being erected to provide shade and earthenware pots will provide cool water. In the state of Uttar Pradesh, at least six election security workers have died. New Delhi, where temperatures have approached 122 this week, nearly 20 degrees above normal, recorded its first official heat-related death of the year on Wednesday. In Jacobabad, long regarded as one of the hottest places on earth, the temperature reached 126 degrees on Sunday, with highs of 124 each of the following three days. About 75 miles away, the Pakistani town of Mohenjo Daro, notable for its Indus Valley civilization sites from 2500 B.C., reached 127 degrees on Sunday, just shy of a record set in 2010. The blazing temperatures compound the challenges for Pakistan, a country of 241 million people that is already grappling with economic and political turmoil. For the more than one million people who live in the Jacobabad district, life is dominated by constant efforts to find ways to cope with the heat. Blackouts lasting 12 to 20 hours a day are common, and some villages lack electricity altogether. The absence of necessities like readily available water and proper housing exacerbates the suffering. Most residents cannot afford air-conditioning or alternatives, like Chinese-made solar power batteries and chargeable fans. A solar panel to run two fans and a lightbulb costs about a month’s wages for laborers in Jacobabad. The water crisis is so severe that donkeys can be seen on the streets carrying tanks, from which residents buy enough water to fill five small plastic jerrycans for $1. Soaring demand has pushed up the price of ice, making this essential commodity even harder to find. Many of the poor have no choice but to work outside. Rice, the lifeblood of Pakistan’s agriculture, demands backbreaking labor in the fields from May to July, the hottest months. For Sahiba, a 25-year-old farmworker who uses one name, each day starts before dawn. She cooks for her family, then walks for miles with other women to reach the fields, where they toil until afternoon under the relentless sun. Nine months pregnant with her 10th child, she carries a double burden. “If we take a day or half-day break, there’s no daily wage, which means my children go hungry that night,” Ms. Sahiba said. Each summer, 25 to 30 percent of the district’s population becomes temporary climate refugees, according to community activists. Some seek refuge in Quetta, a city 185 miles north, where the heat is more bearable. Others go to the port city of Karachi, 310 miles south, which has had its own deadly heat waves but offers some relief with its less frequent blackouts. “Those who can afford it may rent houses in cooler cities, but most residents are simply too poor. They struggle to survive under makeshift tents erected in the open sky,” said Jan Odhano, head of the Community Development Foundation, a Jacobabad-based organization that helps the poor cope with the heat. Jansher Khoso, a 38-year-old garment worker, knows this struggle all too well. In 2018, his mother went to the hospital with heatstroke as temperatures spiked in Jacobabad. Now, every April, he sends his family to Quetta, where they remain until the autumn, while he works in Karachi. But this comes at a steep price. “I work for 16 hours in Karachi to afford the expense of this temporary migration,” Mr. Khoso said, “because I don’t want any of my family members to die in the cruel heat of Jacobabad.” Jacobabad’s suffering has not been limited to high temperatures. In 2022, monsoon rains and devastating floods — linked to erratic weather patterns associated with climate change — submerged the district and about a third of Pakistan overall, killing at least 1,700 people. The heat is nothing new in the city, which was named after John Jacob, a British brigadier general who experienced its harsh climate firsthand in the 19th century. Leading a small force to quell rebel tribes and bandits, General Jacob lost a lieutenant and seven soldiers to the heat on the first day of a 10-mile march. His diary described the wind as “a blast from the furnace” even at night. To cope with the hostile climate, General Jacob introduced an irrigation system and built three canals to supply fresh river water to residents. Today, the canals are dry and full of garbage.",south asia bakes blistering heat wave lifeordeath decision arrive midday sun abideen khan yearold son need every penny day make molding mud brick kiln open sky jacobabad city southern pakistan temperature soared high degree fahrenheit degree celsius recent day forced stop pm cutting earnings half isnt heat said mr khan sweat dripping face soaking worn clothes punishment maybe god yet another brutal summer age climate change part world among vulnerable dire effect suffering come extreme heat pakistan neighboring india experiencing continue day week forecaster say already exacted deadly toll northern indian state bihar official said least people died heat report state india north indicate count could considerably higher india pakistan hospital reported large number heatstroke case ten died bihar poll worker preparing voting held state saturday final day india national election mitigate heat glucose electrolyte distributed polling officer tent erected provide shade earthenware pot provide cool water state uttar pradesh least six election security worker died new delhi temperature approached week nearly degree normal recorded first official heatrelated death year wednesday jacobabad long regarded one hottest place earth temperature reached degree sunday high following three day mile away pakistani town mohenjo daro notable indus valley civilization site bc reached degree sunday shy record set blazing temperature compound challenge pakistan country million people already grappling economic political turmoil one million people live jacobabad district life dominated constant effort find way cope heat blackout lasting hour day common village lack electricity altogether absence necessity like readily available water proper housing exacerbates suffering resident afford airconditioning alternative like chinesemade solar power battery chargeable fan solar panel run two fan lightbulb cost month wage laborer jacobabad water crisis severe donkey seen street carrying tank resident buy enough water fill five small plastic jerrycans soaring demand pushed price ice making essential commodity even harder find many poor choice work outside rice lifeblood pakistan agriculture demand backbreaking labor field may july hottest month sahiba yearold farmworker us one name day start dawn cook family walk mile woman reach field toil afternoon relentless sun nine month pregnant th child carry double burden take day halfday break there daily wage mean child go hungry night m sahiba said summer percent district population becomes temporary climate refugee according community activist seek refuge quetta city mile north heat bearable others go port city karachi mile south deadly heat wave offer relief le frequent blackout afford may rent house cooler city resident simply poor struggle survive makeshift tent erected open sky said jan odhano head community development foundation jacobabadbased organization help poor cope heat jansher khoso yearold garment worker know struggle well mother went hospital heatstroke temperature spiked jacobabad every april sends family quetta remain autumn work karachi come steep price work hour karachi afford expense temporary migration mr khoso said dont want family member die cruel heat jacobabad jacobabads suffering limited high temperature monsoon rain devastating flood linked erratic weather pattern associated climate change submerged district third pakistan overall killing least people heat nothing new city named john jacob british brigadier general experienced harsh climate firsthand th century leading small force quell rebel tribe bandit general jacob lost lieutenant seven soldier heat first day mile march diary described wind blast furnace even night cope hostile climate general jacob introduced irrigation system built three canal supply fresh river water resident today canal dry full garbage,-60.0,negative,2
nytimes,"Wall Street Lands on India, Looking for Profits It Can’t Find in China","May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/business/india-foreign-investors.html,"Mumbai, India’s financial capital, has seen a lot of new faces over the past year. The heads of global banks have been trooping through, visiting its stock exchanges, buying property and hiring new staff. A postpandemic boom has pushed the value of India’s stock market to about $5 trillion, putting it neck and neck with Hong Kong’s. India’s economy is among the fastest growing in the world. Wall Street can’t ignore India anymore. The point of entry is Mumbai, a port city of 26 million people, counting its suburbs. Mumbai has been given a makeover: Suspension bridges span its seaways, as well as its infamous slums, and new metro lines have been carved beneath its Art Deco and Indo-Saracenic facades and rumbling commuter railways. Mumbai has been India’s commercial hub for eight decades, but it was relatively unfamiliar to global finance until the past two years. Now North American pension managers, sovereign wealth funds from the Persian Gulf and Singapore, Japanese banks and private equity firms are clamoring for a piece of India’s growth. Old hands and novices alike can rattle off reasons India’s rise is inevitable. Making money will be easier said than done, not least because Indian investors got here first. Compared with Indian companies’ current profits, their stock prices are high. Foreign investors have yet to throw in their full financial weight. Mumbai’s markets were jittery in May, as Narendra Modi, the pro-business prime minister, fought for re-election. He is expected to win, but uncertainties have made far-flung investors feel cautious. Despite all the hot money pouring into the Mumbai markets, India remains a tricky place for foreign companies to navigate, making direct investment risky. Demand for spending by India’s potentially vast base of consumers has been lagging expectations — the top of the income ladder is spending more than ever, while hundreds of millions of people are stuck near the bottom. The simple reason for investors’ enthusiasm is India’s economy, which has strengths other big emerging economies are currently lacking. Foreign clients, an Indian bank executive said, “gravitate to India because it is showing reliable growth, its currency is stable, it’s showing fiscal discipline.” He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he works closely with the government. If India looks better to global investors, China and Russia look worse. China’s miraculous growth engine is sputtering, after three decades at full throttle, with threats of trade wars becoming routine. And Russia was effectively crossed off some lists of viable emerging economies after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the sanctions imposed on it by the United States, Europe and their allies. That is one reason, the banker said, investors pushed Wall Street to make it easier to bet big sums of money on India. The MSCI, an influential stock index of emerging markets started by Morgan Stanley, has increased India’s weighting to more than 18 percent, from 8 percent in 2020, while reducing China’s representation. It’s not just stocks: In June, JPMorgan Chase will add Indian government bonds to its emerging-markets index. Both changes mean that mutual funds are buying more Indian financial assets. Aashish Agarwal, India country head for the investment bank Jefferies, has been doing deals in Mumbai for more than 20 years. He said the case for investing in India was a no-brainer: Indian stocks are outperforming China’s. India’s markets also draw on a wider range of companies than many other emerging economies, he said. “You can’t think of Korea without Samsung, or Latin America without commodities,” Mr. Agarwal said. “India, as an index, is arguably the most balanced you might find outside of the U.S.” The view looks equally sunny to Kevin Carter from Lafayette, Calif. He founded an investment firm, called EMQQ Global, that sells exchange-traded funds, which make it easy for ordinary people to invest in emerging markets. The value of one fund that focuses on India’s internet and e-commerce sectors has grown nearly 40 percent in the past year. India, he said, has the makings of what historically has helped emerging markets to succeed: a large population, especially of young people, and economic growth that is causing people to spend more. With 1.4 billion people and counting, India is the world’s most populous country. Most Indians are working age or will be soon, unlike residents of Europe or East Asia. India’s economic growth rate, which hovered around 7 percent for the past couple of years, has compared favorably with a world average of 3.2 percent. On Friday, on the eve of the election’s last day, India’s central bank delivered a happy surprise. Growth in the most recent quarter was even higher than economists expected, giving the past fiscal year an official rate of 8.2 percent. Still, for some investors, there is an air of déjà vu. They remember a time almost 15 years ago when India was last thought to be ready to overtake China’s rate of economic growth. Those who bought the India hype then ended up disappointed. From 2008 to 2020, China’s per-capita income quadrupled while India’s grew by 2.5 times. That left India poor compared with the rest of the world. The latest calculation by the International Monetary Fund placed India at 138 in national rankings of income, between the Republic of Congo and Nicaragua. China was in 65th place. But India is moving up, a lot faster than China can. Along the way, India is spending heavily on public infrastructure, a hallmark of Mr. Modi’s policies in 10 years in office. In Mumbai itself, there were just three skyscrapers in 2008 — it will have sprouted hundreds by the end of this year. The city’s center of gravity has shifted from its downtown to the purpose-built Bandra Kurla Complex, or BKC, a midtown sprawl of concrete spaghetti. The One BKC tower, home to Bank of America and Switzerland’s insurance giant Swiss Re, as well as many others, was bought by Blackstone, the world’s biggest private-equity group, for a reported $300 million in 2019. Mumbai, of course, is also home to the stock market, which has attracted the savings of India’s own rapidly expanding investor class. Banks have made it easier for middle-income Indian families to invest directly. So many newbie investors have lost money on the risky trading of derivatives — investment securities tied to other securities — that the regulators want to rein them back in. A stiffer test for India’s economy will be whether it can draw more foreign direct investment — the buying up of whole chunks of private businesses by investors or companies. Nivruti Rai, managing director of Invest India, a joint venture between the commerce ministry and private chambers of commerce, is trying to ease the way. Ms. Rai is well positioned for the job, having spent nearly 30 years at Intel, spanning India and America. “I am a woman, I come from tech, from a multinational,” she said, “and I’m based in India. All this sends a message.” More longer-term foreign funding would help strengthen and stabilize the Indian rupee. Investors who make such financial commitments also tend to bring technical expertise. “We may be missing on capital and, in some places, we may be missing on technology,” she said. Ms. Rai has a lofty target — $100 billion in foreign direct investment. That’s higher than what India drew in 2021, which was a record, and much higher than it is now. The inflow sank 16.8 percent last year to just over $28 billion. Foreign investment shrank in many spots around the world in 2023, but India, like China, was hit especially hard. Ms. Rai nonetheless foresees a new cycle of investment activity centered on Indian companies in health care technology, clean energy and artificial intelligence. Mr. Modi has promised a tenfold increase in India’s economy by 2047, in time for the 100th anniversary of its independence. To get there, Ms. Rai noted, the country will need an even faster rate of growth, and that means more of “these investors that we’re trying to draw in.”",mumbai india financial capital seen lot new

nytimes,"Millions of Indians Living Abroad Have a Say in the Election, Even if They Can’t Vote","May 30, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/world/asia/india-election-diaspora-expats.html,"The dishes at a community center potluck for Indian expatriates near Washington, D.C., ranged from chana masala, a popular northern Indian chickpea curry, to idli, a southern Indian rice cake. The guests’ views on India’s general election were equally varied. Some praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic achievements. Supporters of candidates challenging Mr. Modi’s party criticized what they saw as his disregard for minorities and democratic norms. “What is the vision for India in 2024?” the host, Somu Kumar, a manager at a cloud computing company, said recently of that winter potluck. “That gets a lot of people excited to talk.” India’s 35 million-member diaspora, roughly equivalent in population to Delhi’s metropolitan area, represents a tiny minority compared with the nearly one billion people who are eligible to take part in a six-week voting process that ends on Saturday. Expatriate Indians also cannot cast absentee ballots under India’s electoral laws. But the diaspora is heavily courted by India’s main political parties. Many of its members are from the country’s political and business elites, and voters back home want to know what they think. “When a person is abroad, people take interest and believe what they say is right,” said Adapa Prasad, the president of the American branch of Mr. Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The result, he said, is that the 10,000 or so B.J.P. volunteers in the United States alone can reach tens of thousands of voters. This spring, Indians around the world have been hosting gatherings and rallies for their preferred political parties. Many Indians abroad are proud of India’s rise and associate Mr. Modi with it. So much of the recent activity has supported his bid for a third term. In the United States, which the Indian government says is home to more than five million people of Indian origin, there have been pro-Modi rallies at Times Square, the Washington Monument, the Golden Gate Bridge and other landmarks. “Save India,” some of the pro-Modi posters said. Pro-Modi groups have also set up phone banks and held other events. In a Chicago suburb last month, Modi supporters wearing the B.J.P.’s saffron tassels lit a bonfire next to a Hindu school as part of a sacred fire ritual. India’s Hindu majority is a key constituency for Mr. Modi, who has been criticized for normalizing Hindu-nationalist policies in a country born as a secular republic. In Australia, a caravan of cars draped in saffron flags stretched for miles through Sydney in April. In Germany, Modi supporters who own restaurants in Berlin and Munich have been hosting gatherings for B.J.P. supporters, said Arun Varma, an entrepreneur who founded an e-commerce brand there. And in Britain, people have been visiting Hindu temples, as well as mosques and churches, to offer prayers for Mr. Modi’s electoral success, said Neil Lal, the chairman and president of the Indian Council of Scotland and the United Kingdom. “The election is the talk of the town,” Mr. Lal said from London. Mr. Modi has actively cultivated the diaspora’s support over the years, in part by filling stadiums around the world for rallies. A 2020 study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think tank in Washington, found that a majority of Indians abroad supported him over his rivals. Milan Vaishnav, a political scientist at Carnegie who studies India’s diaspora, said that expatriate Indians were a marginal force in Indian politics and that their campaign donations, while difficult to quantify, were small compared with the billions of dollars raised at home. “But gatherings of the diaspora have helped the B.J.P. create an image of global popularity,” he said. The B.J.P. isn’t the only party active outside India. The overseas arm of its main rival, the Indian National Congress, organizes events, distributes campaign posters and helps to place columns in newspapers. The Aam Aadmi Party, which is part of a parliamentary coalition led by the Congress Party, has overseas members who run phone banks and spread friendly memes about its candidates. Mr. Kumar, an Aam Aadmi supporter, said there was growing concern in the diaspora about a potential third Modi term. He said expatriates watching India worry about the recent marginalization of religious minorities, the assassination of a separatist and the jailings of opposition politicians. Some of the people who attend his potlucks, many of whom he plays cricket with, are stalwart Modi backers. Others are onetime Modi supporters who now question whether he should be re-elected. “I hope this also translates back toward India,” Mr. Kumar said. Outside of the main parties, independent activists who live abroad have criticized the government in ways that would be difficult in India, where Mr. Modi’s government has cracked down on dissent and jailed opposition leaders. One of those activists, Suresh Ediga, an Indian expatriate in New Jersey, organizes meetings on election reform and runs a blog that fact checks Indian politicians. “Independent institutions have collapsed under Modi,” he said. “That is more alarming than anything else.” While many in the diaspora have thrown themselves into campaigning, others have taken a more hands-off approach. Lion Hina Trivedi, a prominent social worker from Gujarat, the Indian state where Mr. Modi served as chief minister from 2001 to 2014, has known him for decades and met him on his trips to Washington. She said that after more than 45 years in Chicago, she was now more invested in her American community. But she still urges the Indians she knows to travel back home to vote, recalling her father’s advice: “Never forget about India.” “You should go,” she tells them. “Your voice matters.”",dish community center potluck indian expatriate near washington dc ranged chana masala popular northern indian chickpea curry idli southern indian rice cake guest view india general election equally varied praised prime minister narendra modis economic achievement supporter candidate challenging mr modis party criticized saw disregard minority democratic norm vision india host somu kumar manager cloud computing company said recently winter potluck get lot people excited talk india millionmember diaspora roughly equivalent population delhi metropolitan area represents tiny minority compared nearly one billion people eligible take part sixweek voting process end saturday expatriate indian also cast absentee ballot india electoral law diaspora heavily courted india main political party many member country political business elite voter back home want know think person abroad people take interest believe say right said adapa prasad president american branch mr modis ruling bharatiya janata party result said bjp volunteer united state alone reach ten thousand voter spring indian around world hosting gathering rally preferred political party many indian abroad proud india rise associate mr modi much recent activity supported bid third term united state indian government say home five million people indian origin promodi rally time square washington monument golden gate bridge landmark save india promodi poster said promodi group also set phone bank held event chicago suburb last month modi supporter wearing bjps saffron tassel lit bonfire next hindu school part sacred fire ritual india hindu majority key constituency mr modi criticized normalizing hindunationalist policy country born secular republic australia caravan car draped saffron flag stretched mile sydney april germany modi supporter restaurant berlin munich hosting gathering bjp supporter said arun varma entrepreneur founded ecommerce brand britain people visiting hindu temple well mosque church offer prayer mr modis electoral success said neil lal chairman president indian council scotland united kingdom election talk town mr lal said london mr modi actively cultivated diaspora support year part filling stadium around world rally study carnegie endowment international peace think tank washington found majority indian abroad supported rival milan vaishnav political scientist carnegie study india diaspora said expatriate indian marginal force indian politics campaign donation difficult quantify small compared billion dollar raised home gathering diaspora helped bjp create image global popularity said bjp isnt party active outside india overseas arm main rival indian national congress organizes event distributes campaign poster help place column newspaper aam aadmi party part parliamentary coalition led congress party overseas member run phone bank spread friendly meme candidate mr kumar aam aadmi supporter said growing concern diaspora potential third modi term said expatriate watching india worry recent marginalization religious minority assassination separatist jailings opposition politician people attend potluck many play cricket stalwart modi backer others onetime modi supporter question whether reelected hope also translates back toward india mr kumar said outside main party independent activist live abroad criticized government way would difficult india mr modis government cracked dissent jailed opposition leader one activist suresh ediga indian expatriate new jersey organizes meeting election reform run blog fact check indian politician independent institution collapsed modi said alarming anything else many diaspora thrown campaigning others taken handsoff approach lion hina trivedi prominent social worker gujarat indian state mr modi served chief minister known decade met trip washington said year chicago invested american community still urge indian know travel back home vote recalling father advice never forget india go tell voice matter,29.0,positive,0
nytimes,New Delhi Sweats Through Its Hottest Recorded Day,"May 29, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/world/asia/india-delhi-hottest-day-ever.html,"New Delhi recorded its highest temperature ever measured on Wednesday — 126 degrees Fahrenheit, or 52.3 degrees Celsius — leaving residents of the Indian capital sweltering in a heat wave that has kept temperatures in several Indian states well above 110 degrees for weeks. In New Delhi, where walking out of the house felt like walking into an oven, officials feared that the electricity grid was being overwhelmed and that the city’s water supply might need rationing. The past 12 months have been the planet’s hottest ever recorded, and cities like Miami are experiencing extreme heat even before the arrival of summer. Scientists said this week that the average person on Earth had experienced 26 more days of abnormally high temperatures in the past year than would have been the case without human-induced climate change. Extreme heat can cause serious health issues and can be fatal. Although late-afternoon dust storms and light drizzle in New Delhi had brought hope of some reprieve on Wednesday, the weather station at Mungeshpur, northwest of the capital, reported a recording of 126 degrees around 2:30 p.m. Dr. Kuldeep Srivastava, a scientist at the regional meteorological center in Delhi, said it was the highest temperature ever recorded by the automatic weather monitoring system, which was installed in 2010. In a statement later on Wednesday evening, India’s meteorological department said the Mungeshpur station was “an outlier compared to other stations.” It said it was assessing whether that station’s recording of a higher temperature than other stations around Delhi was due to an error or a local mitigating factor. The previous record for the highest temperature, around 48 degrees Celsius — about 118.5 Fahrenheit — was repeatedly crossed in recent days. Three of New Delhi’s weather stations reported temperatures of 49.8 degree Celsius — 121.8 degrees Fahrenheit — or higher on Tuesday, setting a new record even before the 52.3 degree reading on Wednesday afternoon. For weeks now, temperatures in several states in India’s north have reached well over 110 degrees, and hospitals have been reporting an uptick in cases of heatstroke. In the Himalayan states, hundreds of forest fires have been reported. Deadly fires in crowded buildings are regular occurrences in India, with many of them caused by short circuits. The rising temperatures have increased concerns about the risks. Atul Garg, Delhi’s fire chief, said daily fire-related calls have crossed 200, the highest in the past decade. “Normally during this period in the last eight to 10 years we would receive 160 calls per day,” Mr. Garg said. “We are stretched in terms of manpower.” The heat wave has coincided with campaigning for India’s general election, with the last phase of voting set to take place on June 1. Candidates, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and opposition leaders, have continued holding large public rallies, despite the temperatures. Nitin Gadkari, a cabinet minister who is running for re-election, fainted from the heat while addressing a rally, and on Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi, the opposition leader, took a break during a speech to pour water from a bottle onto his head. “It’s quite hot, no?” he said. To help conserve water amid the extreme heat, Atishi Marlena, Delhi’s water minister, announced the deployment of 200 teams to crack down on waste and misuse. Fines will be imposed for activities such as washing cars with hoses, “overflow of water tanks” and “use of domestic water for construction or commercial” purposes, she said. Delhi’s lieutenant governor, V.K. Saxena, ordered measures to protect construction workers during the midday heat, and for water to be provided at bus stands. The state broadcaster reported that Mr. Saxena, who was appointed by Mr. Modi, had also called for construction workers to get “paid leave” between noon and 3 p.m. But it did not say how that would be implemented, particularly at a moment when the capital region’s administration is paralyzed by infighting between its lieutenant governor and the elected chief minister. Just how much the heat has affected daily life in the Indian capital was captured in the adjournment order of a consumer dispute court last week when the most intense period of the heat wave began. The presiding official, Suresh Kumar Gupta, complained that the room had no air-conditioning, and the water supply in the bathrooms was also affected. “There is too much heat in the courtroom, which led to sweating, as such it is difficult to hear arguments,” he said in the order. “In these circumstances, arguments cannot be heard, so case is adjourned.” Jitender Singh, 42, an auto rickshaw driver in the eastern part of the city, said that business was down by about a third because people were avoiding leaving their homes. He said he and his colleagues had frequently fallen sick. “But we must come on the road to support our families,” he added.",new delhi recorded highest temperature ever measured wednesday degree fahrenheit degree celsius leaving resident indian capital sweltering heat wave kept temperature several indian state well degree week new delhi walking house felt like walking oven official feared electricity grid overwhelmed city water supply might need rationing past month planet hottest ever recorded city like miami experiencing extreme heat even arrival summer scientist said week average person earth experienced day abnormally high temperature past year would case without humaninduced climate change extreme heat cause serious health issue fatal although lateafternoon dust storm light drizzle new delhi brought hope reprieve wednesday weather station mungeshpur northwest capital reported recording degree around pm dr kuldeep srivastava scientist regional meteorological center delhi said highest temperature ever recorded automatic weather monitoring system installed statement later wednesday evening india meteorological department said mungeshpur station outlier compared station said assessing whether station recording higher temperature station around delhi due error local mitigating factor previous record highest temperature around degree celsius fahrenheit repeatedly crossed recent day three new delhi weather station reported temperature degree celsius degree fahrenheit higher tuesday setting new record even degree reading wednesday afternoon week temperature several state india north reached well degree hospital reporting uptick case heatstroke himalayan state hundred forest fire reported deadly fire crowded building regular occurrence india many caused short circuit rising temperature increased concern risk atul garg delhi fire chief said daily firerelated call crossed highest past decade normally period last eight year would receive call per day mr garg said stretched term manpower heat wave coincided campaigning india general election last phase voting set take place june candidate including prime minister narendra modi opposition leader continued holding large public rally despite temperature nitin gadkari cabinet minister running reelection fainted heat addressing rally tuesday rahul gandhi opposition leader took break speech pour water bottle onto head quite hot said help conserve water amid extreme heat atishi marlena delhi water minister announced deployment team crack waste misuse fine imposed activity washing car hose overflow water tank use domestic water construction commercial purpose said delhi lieutenant governor vk saxena ordered measure protect construction worker midday heat water provided bus stand state broadcaster reported mr saxena appointed mr modi also called construction worker get paid leave noon pm say would implemented particularly moment capital region administration paralyzed infighting lieutenant governor elected chief minister much heat affected daily life indian capital captured adjournment order consumer dispute court last week intense period heat wave began presiding official suresh kumar gupta complained room airconditioning water supply bathroom also affected much heat courtroom led sweating difficult hear argument said order circumstance argument heard case adjourned jitender singh auto rickshaw driver eastern part city said business third people avoiding leaving home said colleague frequently fallen sick must come road support family added,-16.0,negative,2

Remal, con vientos de más de 110 kilómetros por hora, dejó un rastro de destrucción, arrancando árboles y dañando el tendido eléctrico en toda la región, según las autoridades. La tormenta mató a 13 personas en Bangladés y dañó o destruyó más de 35.000 viviendas en las zonas costeras, afectando a unos 3,5 millones de personas, según las autoridades. Más de 13 millones de personas se quedaron sin electricidad el lunes por la noche, según funcionarios del Ministerio de Energía. El país del sur de Asia tiene 170 millones de habitantes. La tormenta también causó cortes de electricidad y daños en viviendas del estado indio de Bengala Occidental. El martes, las autoridades dijeron que al menos 10 personas habían muerto, y varias más estaban desaparecidas, después de que las fuertes lluvias de los remanentes del ciclón provocaran el derrumbe de una cantera en el estado indio del sur de Mizorán, vecino de Bangladés. La tormenta llegó tras semanas de intenso calor en la región, con temperaturas que alcanzaron los 40 grados centígrados. Remal tocó tierra cerca de Mongla, el puerto del sur de Bangladés, y de las vecinas islas Sagar, de India, hacia las 9 p. m. del domingo. Alrededor de un millón de personas fueron evacuadas de los pueblos costeros de Bangladés antes de que llegara la tormenta. La mayoría de esas aldeas quedaron inundadas, dejando a millones de personas vulnerables, según las autoridades. “Mientras el ciclón Remal azota las zonas costeras de Bangladés, más de 8,4 millones de personas, entre ellas 3,2 millones de niños, corren graves riesgos en materia de salud, nutrición, saneamiento y seguridad”, declaró en un comunicado Sheldon Yett, representante de UNICEF en Bangladés. La capital de Bangladés, Daca, en el interior del país, se vio afectada por lluvias torrenciales y fuertes vientos. La tormenta interrumpió los vuelos en el aeropuerto internacional Shah Amanat, en el sureste de Bangladés, y en el aeropuerto de Calcuta, en India. El martes, la tormenta se había debilitado, pero los meteorólogos de Bangladés e India advirtieron de que las lluvias torrenciales y los fuertes vientos podrían continuar durante unos días. Bangladés ha sufrido varias tormentas violentas en los últimos años. El pasado mes de mayo, un fuerte ciclón, Mocha, azotó Bangladés y Birmania y dejó varios muertos. La tormenta causó daños generalizados en los extensos campos de refugiados rohinyás de Cox’s Bazar, destruyendo más de 3000 cabañas y centros de aprendizaje construidos con tablillas de bambú y lonas de plástico. En Filipinas también se ha producido la primera tormenta tropical de la temporada. El tifón Ewiniar azotó el país isleño en la madrugada del sábado.

Remal, which had measured winds of over 70 miles per hour, left a trail of destruction, uprooting trees and damaging power lines throughout the region, officials said. The storm killed 13 people in Bangladesh, and it damaged or destroyed more than 35,000 homes across the coastal areas, affecting about 3.5 million people, according to officials. More than 13 million people there lost electricity on Monday evening, according to power ministry officials. The South Asian country has a population of 170 million. The storm also caused power outages and damaged homes in the Indian state of West Bengal. On Tuesday, officials said that at least 10 people were killed, with several more missing, after heavy rains from the remnants of the cyclone caused a stone quarry to collapse in the northeastern Indian state of Mizoram, which neighbors Bangladesh. The storm hit after weeks of intense heat in the region, with temperatures reaching about 104 Fahrenheit, or 40 Celsius. Remal made landfall near Bangladesh’s southern port of Mongla and the neighboring Sagar Islands of India around 9 p.m. on Sunday. Around a million people were evacuated from Bangladesh’s coastal villages before the storm hit. Most of those villages were flooded, leaving millions of people vulnerable, officials said. “As Cyclone Remal hits the coastal areas of Bangladesh, over 8.4 million people, including 3.2 million children, are at high health, nutrition, sanitation and safety risks,” Sheldon Yett, a UNICEF representative to Bangladesh, said in a statement. Bangladesh’s inland capital, Dhaka was hit with heavy rain and strong winds. The storm disrupted flights at Shah Amanat International Airport in southeastern Bangladesh and at Kolkata Airport in India. By Tuesday, the storm had weakened, but meteorologists in Bangladesh and India warned that heavy rain and strong winds could continue for a few days. Bangladesh has been hit with several violent storms in recent years. Last May, a severe cyclone, Mocha, hit Bangladesh and Myanmar and left several people dead. The storm caused widespread damage in the sprawling Rohingya refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, destroying over 3,000 shanties and learning centers made of bamboo slats and plastic tarpaulin. The Philippines has also seen its first tropical storm of the season. Typhoon Ewiniar hit the island nation early Saturday morning.

nytimes,"Leaflet by Leaflet, a Few Aging Activists Fight India’s Tide of Bigotry","May 28, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/world/asia/india-activists.html,"One recent morning, Roop Rekha Verma, an 80-year-old peace activist and former university leader, walked through a north Indian neighborhood prone to sectarian strife and parked herself near a tea shop. From her sling bag, she pulled out a bundle of pamphlets bearing messages of religious tolerance and mutual coexistence and began handing them to passers-by. “Talk to each other. Don’t let anyone divide you,” one read in Hindi. Spreading those simple words is an act of bravery in today’s India. Ms. Verma and others like her are waging a lonely battle against a tide of hatred and bigotry increasingly normalized by India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his deputies have vilified the country’s minorities in a yearslong campaign that has escalated during the current national election, the small band of aging activists has built bridges and preached harmony between religious groups. They have continued to hit the pavement even as the price for dissent and free speech has become high, trying to keep the flame alive for the nonsectarian ideal embedded in India’s constitution and in their own memories. More than three dozen human rights defenders, poets, journalists and opposition politicians face charges, including under antiterrorism laws, for criticizing Mr. Modi’s divisive policies, according to rights groups. (The government has said little about the charges, other than repeating its line that the law takes its own course.) The crackdown has had a chilling effect on many Indians. “That is where the role of these civil society activists becomes more important,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, a deputy director at Human Rights Watch. “Despite a crackdown, they are refusing to cow down, leading them to hold placards, distributing fliers, to revive a message that once was taken for granted.” The use of posters and pamphlets to raise public awareness is a time-tested practice among Indian activists. Revolutionaries fighting for independence from British colonizers employed them to drum up support and mobilize ordinary Indians. Today, village leaders use them to spread awareness about health and other government programs. Such old-school outreach may seem quixotic in the digital age. Every day, India’s social media spaces, reaching hundreds of millions of people, are inundated with anti-Muslim vitriol promoted by the B.J.P. and its associated right-wing organizations. During the national election that ends next week, Mr. Modi and his party have targeted Muslims directly, by name, with brazen attacks both online and in campaign speeches. (The B.J.P. rejects accusations that it discriminates against Muslims, noting that government welfare programs under its supervision assist all Indians equally.) Those who have worked in places torn apart by sectarian violence say polarization can be combated only by going to people on the streets and making them understand its dangers. Merely showing up can help. For Ms. Verma, the seeds of her activism were planted during her childhood, when she listened to horror stories of the sectarian violence that left hundreds of thousands dead during the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947. Later, as a university philosophy professor, she fought caste discrimination and religious divides both inside and outside the classroom. She opposed patriarchal attitudes even as slurs were thrown at her. In the early 1980s, when she noticed that the names of mothers were excluded from student admission forms, she pressed for their inclusion and won. But more than anything else, it was the campaign to build a major Hindu temple in the town of Ayodhya in her home state of Uttar Pradesh that gave Ms. Verma’s life a new meaning. In 1992, a Hindu mob demolished a centuries-old mosque there, claiming that the site had previously held a Hindu temple. Deadly riots followed. This past January, three decades later, the Ayodhya temple opened, inaugurated by Mr. Modi. It was a significant victory for a Hindu nationalist movement whose maligning and marginalizing of Muslims is exactly what Ms. Verma has devoted herself to opposing. The Hindu majority, she said, has a responsibility to protect minorities, “not become complicit in their demonization.” While the government’s incitement of religious enmity is new in India, the sectarian divisions themselves are not. One activist, Vipin Kumar Tripathi, 76, a former physics professor at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi, said he had started gathering students after classes and educating them about the dangers of “religious radicalization” in the early 1990s. Today, Mr. Tripathi travels to different parts of India with a message of peace. Recently, he stood in a corner of a busy train station in northeastern New Delhi. As office workers, students and laborers ran toward platforms, he handed information sheets and brochures to anyone who extended a hand. His materials addressed some of the most provocative issues in India: the troubles in Kashmir, where the Modi government has rescinded the majority-Muslim region’s semi-autonomy; the politics over the Ayodhya temple; and ordinary citizens’ rights to question their government. “To respect God and to pretend to do that for votes are two different things,” read one of his handouts. At the station, Anirudh Saxena, a tall man in his early 30s with a pencil mustache, stopped and looked Mr. Tripathi straight in the eyes. “Sir, why are you doing this every week?” Mr. Saxena asked. “Read this,” Mr. Tripathi told Mr. Saxena, handing him a small 10-page booklet. “This explains why we should read books and understand history instead of reading WhatsApp garbage and extracting pleasure out of someone’s pain.” Mr. Saxena smiled, nodded his head and put the booklet in his handbag before disappearing into the crowd. If just 10 out of a thousand people read his materials, Mr. Tripathi said, his job is done. “When truth becomes the casualty, you can only fight it on the streets,” he said. Shabnam Hashmi, 66, another activist based in New Delhi, said she had helped distribute about four million pamphlets in the state of Gujarat after sectarian riots there in 2002. More than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, died in the communal violence, which happened under the watch of Mr. Modi, who was the state’s top leader at the time. During that period, she and her colleagues were harassed by right-wing activists, who threw stones at her and filed police complaints. In 2016, months after Mr. Modi became prime minister, the government prohibited foreign funding for her organization. She has continued her street activism nonetheless. “It is the most effective way of reaching the people directly,” she said. “What it does is, it somehow gives people courage to fight fear and keep resisting.” “We might not be able to stop this craziness,” she added, “but that doesn’t mean we should stop fighting.” Even before Mr. Modi’s rise, said Ms. Verma, the activist in Uttar Pradesh, governments never “showered roses” on her when she was doing things like leading marches and bringing together warring factions after flare-ups of religious violence. Over the decades, she has been threatened with prison and bundled into police vehicles. “But it was never so bad,” she said, as it has now become under Mr. Modi. The space for activism may completely vanish, Ms. Verma said, as his party becomes increasingly intolerant of any scrutiny. For now, she said, activists “are, sadly, just giving proof of our existence: that we may be demoralized, but we are still alive. Otherwise, hatred has seeped so deep it will take decades to rebuild trust.”",one recent morning roop rekha verma yearold peace activist former university leader walked north indian neighborhood prone

nytimes,Two Deadly Fires in Rapid Succession Expose India’s Gaps in Safety,"May 26, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/world/asia/india-fire-death-infants-safety.html,"Seven newborn babies lost their lives after their New Delhi neonatal clinic was engulfed in flames. What remained of the two-story building on Sunday morning was its burned facade, a charred spiral staircase and oxygen cylinders covered in soot. Hours earlier, in the western Indian city of Rajkot, an amusement park of trampolines and bowling lanes had turned to an inferno. The families of people who had come to enjoy a discounted offer of all-you-can-play to celebrate the start of summer vacation were left trying to identify bodies among the at least 27 dead, many of them children too charred to be recognizable. As after every such deadly episode, political leaders were quick with messages of condolence, announcements of arrests, creations of inquiries — and finger-pointing. But to analysts and experts who had warned for years about India’s abysmal fire preparedness, the back-to-back disasters on Saturday were the latest reminder that systemic change to make the country safer was still missing. Building safety compliance remains abysmal across India, the world’s most populous nation. The fire services have long faced huge gaps in the numbers of stations, personnel and equipment. Government audits after mass-casualty disasters unearth glaring shortcomings, with little follow-up. Though the number has gone down over the past decade, more than 20 fire-related deaths occur every day in India, according to government statistics. Many of the fires — particularly in crowded urban centers — are caused by short circuits, an alarming prospect as India faces an intense period of heat waves that strains electrical wires. R.C. Sharma, a former fire service chief in Delhi, said that one major problem is that fire regulations go unenforced. Another is that fire-response resources have failed to keep up with urbanization that is happening rapidly and often without regard to safety. “We are not in a good condition,” Mr. Sharma said. “In other countries, you have fire hydrants and everything at all the places. But in India, we don’t even have drinking water around the clock, so we do not think of having firefighting water around the clock.” Data provided to the Indian Parliament in 2019 by the country’s Home Ministry painted a dire state of preparedness, with major deficiencies. India had only 3,377 fire stations when regulations called for 8,559. The shortfall in personnel and equipment was even worse. The fire service had about 55,000 people, when a half-million were called for, and 7,300 vehicles, when it should have had 33,000. It is unclear how much of those gaps have been filled in the five years since. A new $600 million program for expansion and modernization of the fire service announced by India’s central government last year, with additional resources to be pooled from the states, suggests a lot of it remains undone. Government audits have repeatedly flagged the vulnerability of public buildings, particularly hospitals. A study last year of hospitals across India where there had been a fire in the past decade showed that half were not legally compliant on safety measures. Private and public hospitals were about equally bad. Short circuits were the cause of the fires in nearly 90 percent of the episodes. In one state, after a fire killed 10 babies in a neonatal care unit, assessments found that more than 80 percent of the state’s hospitals had never carried out fire safety audits; half had never conducted fire drills; and only a few had fire safety certificates. “The tendency is to comply in letter, not spirit,” said S.A. Abbasi, an emeritus professor at Pondicherry University, who was the lead author of the report. “Lapses and laxity continue to be the norms rather than exceptions.” What caused the fire at the amusement park in Rajkot, in the state of Gujarat, was not known. But the initial police complaint, a copy of which was seen by The New York Times, made clear that the facility lacked both a clearance certificate from the fire department and effective equipment and protocols in case of fire. Ilesh Kher, Rajkot’s chief fire officer, said the fire at the facility had started just before 6 p.m., and the flames were contained in a little over an hour. He did not know how many people were present when the blaze broke out, but witness accounts in local news suggested over 100. The building appeared to be a temporary structure made of iron poles and metal sheets. Daksh Kujadia, a teenager who had gone bowling with a cousin, said the fire had started under an emergency exit. About 30 people became trapped in the bowling lanes. “We didn’t have an option but to tear the metal sheet in a corner,” he told local news media. “Fifteen of us got out by jumping from there.” The two-story Delhi neonatal hospital that caught fire just before midnight was operating out of a residential building. Neighbors described frequent disputes, as trucks often blocked the road outside the hospital to unload large cylinders of oxygen. “A few of us climbed on top of each other and climbed into the building from the back side,” said Ravi Gupta, who lives in the area and helped evacuate a dozen babies from the back of the building as the front caught fire and multiple explosions were heard as oxygen cylinders burst. “We brought ladders and bedsheets from our houses. I carried infants in my hands from the fire and brought them down.” Health care in Delhi, India’s capital, has in recent years has been caught in a messy political fight between the central government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Delhi’s elected local government, run by a smaller opposition party, the Aam Aadmi Party, or A.A.P. The local administration has accused Mr. Modi of using his control over government officials to handicap its efforts. Accusations continued to fly after Saturday’s deadly hospital fire. Pankaj Luthra, a local official affiliated with Modi’s party in the neighborhood where the hospital is, blamed the A.A.P. for giving the hospital its license. There had been, he said, complaints of illegal oxygen cylinder refilling at the hospital. Saurabh Bhardwaj, A.A.P.’s health minister for Delhi, released a statement complaining that the most senior official in Delhi’s health department — a civil servant technically supervised by Mr. Bhardwaj, but in fact answering to the central government — was ignoring his calls and messages. “I got to know about this incident through a media flash,” Mr. Bhardwaj said.",seven newborn baby lost life new delhi neonatal clinic engulfed flame remained twostory building sunday morning burned facade charred spiral staircase oxygen cylinder covered soot hour earlier western indian city rajkot amusement park trampoline bowling lane turned inferno family people come enjoy discounted offer allyoucanplay celebrate start summer vacation left trying identify body among least dead many child charred recognizable every deadly episode political leader quick message condolence announcement arrest creation inquiry fingerpointing analyst expert warned year india abysmal fire preparedness backtoback disaster saturday latest reminder systemic change make country safer still missing building safety compliance remains abysmal across india world populous nation fire service long faced huge gap number station personnel equipment government audit masscasualty disaster unearth glaring shortcoming little followup though number gone past decade firerelated death occur every day india according government statistic many fire particularly crowded urban center caused short circuit alarming prospect india face intense period heat wave strain electrical wire rc sharma former fire service chief delhi said one major problem fire regulation go unenforced another fireresponse resource failed keep urbanization happening rapidly often without regard safety good condition mr sharma said country fire hydrant everything place india dont even drinking water around clock think firefighting water around clock data provided indian parliament country home ministry painted dire state preparedness major deficiency india fire station regulation called shortfall personnel equipment even worse fire service people halfmillion called vehicle unclear much gap filled five year since new million program expansion modernization fire service announced india central government last year additional resource pooled state suggests lot remains undone government audit repeatedly flagged vulnerability public building particularly hospital study last year hospital across india fire past decade showed half legally compliant safety measure private public hospital equally bad short circuit cause fire nearly percent episode one state fire killed baby neonatal care unit assessment found percent state hospital never carried fire safety audit half never conducted fire drill fire safety certificate tendency comply letter spirit said sa abbasi emeritus professor pondicherry university lead author report lapse laxity continue norm rather exception caused fire amusement park rajkot state gujarat known initial police complaint copy seen new york time made clear facility lacked clearance certificate fire department effective equipment protocol case fire ilesh kher rajkots chief fire officer said fire facility started pm flame contained little hour know many people present blaze broke witness account local news suggested building appeared temporary structure made iron pole metal sheet daksh kujadia teenager gone bowling cousin said fire started emergency exit people became trapped bowling lane didnt option tear metal sheet corner told local news medium fifteen u got jumping twostory delhi neonatal hospital caught fire midnight operating residential building neighbor described frequent dispute truck often blocked road outside hospital unload large cylinder oxygen u climbed top climbed building back side said ravi gupta life area helped evacuate dozen baby back building front caught fire multiple explosion heard oxygen cylinder burst brought ladder bedsheets house carried infant hand fire brought health care delhi india capital recent year caught messy political fight central government prime minister narendra modi delhi elected local government run smaller opposition party aam aadmi party aap local administration accused mr modi using control government official handicap effort accusation continued fly saturday deadly hospital fire pankaj luthra local official affiliated modis party neighborhood hospital blamed aap giving hospital license said complaint illegal oxygen cylinder refilling hospital saurabh bhardwaj aaps health minister delhi released statement complaining senior official delhi health department civil servant technically supervised mr bhardwaj fact answering central government ignoring call message got know incident medium flash mr bhardwaj said,-87.0,negative,0
nytimes,"I’m an Indian Muslim, and I’m Scared to Say So","May 26, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/opinion/india-muslim-modi-election.html,"I used to answer the phone with “Salam.” Not anymore. I don’t want people to know I’m a Muslim. There is little that would identify me as Muslim to begin with, aside from my name. I don’t wear a skullcap, and in public I avoid wearing the loosefitting Pathani kurta and peppering my speech with Urdu words, all of which are identity markers for Indian Muslims. But in the India of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you can’t take any chances. For 10 years, Mr. Modi’s Hindu-chauvinist government has vilified the nation’s 200 million Muslims as dangerous undesirables. Recently, he took that rhetoric to a new low during the six weeks of voting in India’s national elections — which are widely expected to win him a third consecutive five-year term — directly referring to Muslims as “infiltrators” in a country that he and his followers seek to turn into a pure Hindu state. As offensive as that was, it is sadly familiar to Indian Muslims like me who — after a decade of denigration, violence and murder — live in daily fear of being identified and attacked, forcing us into self-denial to protect ourselves. India is home to one of the world’s largest Muslim populations. Islam came here around 1,300 years ago, and Indian Muslims descend from natives of this land who converted to Islam centuries ago. Many Indian Muslims fought against British colonization, and millions rejected the 1947 partition of the country into a predominantly Hindu India and a mostly Muslim Pakistan. India is our home, and people like me are proud patriots. But Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalism has made us the targets in what might be the largest radicalization of people on the planet. Its seeds were planted with the founding in 1925 of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing Hindu organization that sought the establishment of a fully Hindu state in India and was inspired by the European fascism of that era. When Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party — a political offshoot of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh — won elections in 2014 and he became prime minister, he and his followers saw it as the civilizational moment that Hindus had been waiting for. Mr. Modi was the god-king who would free Hindu civilization from centuries of domination, first by a series of Muslim rulers culminating with the Mughal empire that ruled India for around three centuries and then by the British colonizers who followed. Islamophobia isn’t new to India, and Muslims also faced prejudice and recurring violence during the generations in which the liberal upper-caste Hindu elite dominated the nation’s secular democratic politics. But under Mr. Modi’s right-wing leadership, hatred of Muslims has effectively become state policy. India is now a country where police have been accused of standing by as Hindus attack Muslims, where the killers of religious minorities go unpunished and where Hindu extremists openly call for the genocide of Muslims. Protest, and you run the risk of having a Hindu mob unleashed on you. That’s what happened after Mr. Modi’s government in 2019 pushed through a citizenship law that discriminates against Muslims and his party promised to expel “infiltrators” from the country. When Indian Muslims protested, one of Mr. Modi’s supporters responded with a provocative speech that is blamed for sparking deadly clashes between Hindus and Muslims in Delhi in February 2020. Police were accused of looking the other way as Muslims had their shops destroyed, were assaulted and were even killed. Bulldozers have become a symbol of this state terrorism — rolled out at right-wing rallies, tattooed on the arms of Modi supporters and featured in Hindu nationalist songs — because of their use in areas governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party to illegally knock down the homes and businesses of Muslims who dare to speak up. Some states have essentially made Muslim-Hindu relationships illegal, based on an absurd Hindu conspiracy theory that Muslim men are seducing Hindu women as part of a long-term plan to turn India into a Muslim nation. The liberal Hindu elite, instead of acknowledging its role in enabling the sentiments on which Mr. Modi has capitalized, has done little to help, other than to ineffectually express nostalgia for a lost Hindu tolerance. And there is little that Indian Muslims can do within the political system: Although the Muslim share of India’s population has slowly grown to 14 percent, the percentage of Parliament members who are Muslim has declined to less than 5 percent today, compared with 9 percent in the early 1980s. The Indian Muslim response to our subjugation has largely been a deafening silence. Many of us are simply unwilling to speak out against the Modi government’s bitter bargain: that for us to exist as Indian citizens, we must meekly accept historical revisionism, dehumanization and demonization. This debasement, and the knowledge that you are essentially outside the protection of the law, kills something inside you. You take precautions to protect yourself. My mother no longer packs mutton for me to take back to Delhi after I visit her, as she used to. She’s afraid it will be mistaken for beef: Dozens of Muslims have reportedly been killed or assaulted by Hindu mobs on suspicion of killing cows — which are sacred to Hindus — or for eating or possessing beef. Muslim parents now routinely repeat a litany of don’ts to their children: Don’t appear Muslim in public, don’t reveal your name, don’t enter Hindu areas or travel alone and don’t get pulled into any potential confrontation. While we caution one another to blend in, it’s difficult to reconcile with the whole thing. Each of us has something embedded in our sense of self and expression that is particularly painful to erase. And the sort of physical markers we are trying to hide are not even wholly specific to Muslims in India. My cousin likes to wear his Pathani kurta, but so do many Hindus. My youngest sister prefers to keep her head covered, but so do many Hindu women, although not with a hijab. I’m attached to using certain Urdu words that have long been a feature of India’s syncretic culture and have been used widely by Hindus, too. Self-denial leads to deep frustration. Now during gatherings with friends and family, we avoid politics; discussing the elephant in the room only reminds us of our helplessness. The cumulative weight of all this has created a mental health crisis of fear and depression among Muslims. Yet because of a desperate shortage of mental health professionals in India and a limited understanding of our new reality by many non-Muslim therapists, many Muslims are left to cope on their own. I was hesitant to write this essay. I am not supposed to protest, to speak up. When I sometimes do, posting online about it, the typical response is, “Go to Pakistan.” But why would I leave? I am an Indian. I was born here, as were my ancestors who opposed the religious basis of the partition with Pakistan and believed in the Indian ideals of secular democracy. But many Muslims have fled over the years, emigrating to Australia, Canada, Britain, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia or elsewhere because of the worsening political climate. Many who can’t afford to emigrate are moving out of the predominantly Hindu or mixed neighborhoods where they lived for decades, to poorer Muslim areas for safety. Two of my Muslim friends and I used to own apartments in a suburban area near New Delhi where many upper-caste Hindus lived. But in 2020, after the discriminatory citizenship law was passed, a Hindu mob charged through the neighborhood baying for Muslim blood. My two friends soon moved out. I kept my apartment, but in the elevator one evening in 2022, I overheard two men discussing how many katua (a derogatory term for Muslims that refers to circumcision) lived in the area. I moved out the next day. Sadly, Hindu friends and colleagues of mine also have become colder and more distant and are dropping out of contact. On June 1, India’s voting period comes to a close. It looms as a day of dread for Muslims like me. According to most projections, it will be another victory for Mr. Modi — and further validation of mob rule and the debasement of 200 million Muslims by a hubristic Hindu majority.",used answer phone

nytimes,Free Food? Modi Makes Sure Every Indian Knows Whom to Thank for It.,"May 26, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/world/asia/india-welfare-modi.html,"Durga Prasad, an 80-year-old farmer, was resting under the shade of a tree in front of his home when the party workers came. An app on their smartphones could tell them in an instant who Mr. Prasad was, whom he might vote for — and why he should be grateful to India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. “You get installments of 2,000 rupees, right?” asked a local official from Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. Mr. Prasad concurred. He receives $72 a year through a farmers’ welfare program started and branded by Mr. Modi. “Do you get rations?” the official then asked, though he already knew the answer. He had made his point. Such handouts are among the most distinctive parts of Mr. Modi’s mass appeal. The country’s new airports, diplomatic prestige and booming stock markets may look like Mr. Modi’s calling card, but for the 95 percent of Indians who earn too little to file income taxes, small infusions of cash and household goods matter more. And Mr. Modi’s party is organized to make the most of them in the national election that ends early next month. India’s welfare programs are vast in reach and scope. Under the biggest, 821 million Indians are entitled to five-kilogram (11-pound) sacks of free rice or wheat every month. The government started doling out grain to prevent hunger early in the pandemic and has since committed $142 billion to the program. Mr. Modi’s face began appearing on the sacks in January. Another prime minister-branded program has helped people build 15 million homes since 2015, at a price tag of $3 billion a year; home improvements and additions are covered, too. The government has also footed the cost of millions of toilets, and it is working to provide piped drinking water to every home. The foundation of this expanded welfare system was laid soon after Mr. Modi became prime minister in 2014. Bank accounts, also “P.M.” branded, became available to all Indians who lacked them, meshed with a universal-ID program started by the previous government. The accounts gave the state valuable information about the financial lives of even its poorest citizens. And they opened the way for “direct benefit transfers,” money that bypasses the sometimes corrupt local officials who once distributed welfare — appearing to come instead from Mr. Modi himself. These transfers grew to $76 billion in the last fiscal year. But Mr. Modi’s budgets have not become profligate. That is in part because government spending on education and health care — long-term investments — has shrunk as a share of the economy as branded welfare programs have proliferated. Spending on a guaranteed-employment program associated with Mr. Modi’s opponents has also fallen. Whatever the motivation behind them, the tangible food and household benefits prioritized by Mr. Modi have relieved Indians’ pain as the economy slowed before the pandemic, collapsed during its first year and then recovered unevenly. The Hindu-nationalist government distributes the assistance equally among all religious groups, even if it does not receive many votes from some of them. The handouts are perhaps the most powerful thing Mr. Modi can point to when claiming credit for improving the lives of his fellow Indians, hundreds of millions of whom remain desperate for reliable jobs with decent pay. Vinod Misra, the local B.J.P. official who recently visited Mr. Prasad in Amethi, a district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, explained that in poorer places where people once died of hunger, “our party is working especially for programs that touch everyone.” “All we have to do is go and tell the family, ‘Brother, this roof you got, who made it happen?’” Mr. Misra said. In a country where 80 percent of the population is either rural or poor, people are dead serious about getting something in exchange for their votes, said Pradeep Gupta, the director of Axis My India, a polling outfit. If a politician delivers on promises, “the people elect you again and again and again,” Mr. Gupta said. Everything else is “marketing.” The B.J.P.’s follow-up with voters is the end result of a gargantuan effort that leverages its ideologically committed core membership, its funding, its nationwide organization and, increasingly, its sophisticated management of data. In the temple town of Pushkar, west of Amethi within the Hindi-speaking “cow belt” that is a stronghold of the B.J.P., another local party worker explained the virtue of an app called Saral. With a few swipes and taps, the worker, Shakti Singh Rathore, shared a bird’s-eye view of his neighbors, whom he intended to marshal for Mr. Modi. There are 241 “booths,” or polling stations, in Pushkar’s constituency, each with its own mapped boundaries. Mr. Rathore flicked open the information for one of the booths he was supervising. His targets were not just voters, but beneficiaries, or “labharthis” — an important new term of art in the ground campaign. “The labharthis’ names are all listed here,” Mr. Rathore said. One man he named had received a cooking gas cylinder — “here is his address and postal code and phone number.” Another had gotten cash from the farmers’ welfare program. “All the data is here,” Mr. Rathore said. Anyone can download Saral through the Apple or Google Play stores for campaign updates, though only enlisted B.J.P. workers get to explore its databases. The party’s national leadership has said it uses Saral to connect more than six million of its workers. They can both retrieve and upload data about voters and beneficiaries. Voters do not seem bothered, or are at least not surprised, that so much information about their relationships with the national government is carried door to door by political workers. Mr. Misra said he did not know exactly how all the personal information made its way into the app. Other local-level workers said they assumed that the data had been provided by the government itself, given its accuracy. Amit Malviya, the B.J.P.’s head of information and technology, said at a start-up conference in December that the 30 terabytes of data had been collected manually by the party over the past 10 elections. Saral does many other things that are useful for the party’s ground game. It tracks workers’ outreach and measures them against one another by their performance, in effect “gamifying” the hard slog of canvassing. It also gives the workers the chance to help smooth out voters’ receipt of their benefits, erasing the distinction between partisan politics and government work. Mr. Modi himself said to a TV crew this month that he had told party workers to gather information about voters who had not received their benefits and to “assure them that it’s the Modi guarantee — they will get it in my third term.” Ajay Singh Gaur, a B.J.P. worker who accompanied Mr. Misra for the doorstepping around Amethi, found himself drawn into a long exchange with Dinesh Maurya, a farmer who complained that a faulty electrical wire had fallen onto his wheat field. “My whole crop was burned down, and I haven’t got a single coin’s worth of compensation,” Mr. Maurya said. Mr. Gaur assured Mr. Maurya that he would get him the money the state owed him. “I have spoken to the officer in charge” at the generating station, he said. “I will get it done.”",durga prasad yearold

nytimes,Is Modi Worried? India’s Long-Deflated Opposition Finds Some Momentum.,"May 23, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/world/asia/india-election-modi-opposition.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi entered India’s general election projecting supreme confidence. “Ab ki baar, 400 paar” went his party’s slogan, meaning this time his side was gunning to surpass 400 seats in the lower house of Parliament, a staggering majority. But as the seven-week voting period enters its final stretch, with results expected on June 4, India is witnessing something unusual from its powerful leader. It is seeing him sweat. As Mr. Modi crisscrosses the country for rallies in 100-degree heat, he has often appeared on the defensive, and sometimes rattled. He has frequently set aside his party’s main campaign message — that India is rising under his leadership — to counter his opponents’ portrayal of him as favoring business and caste elites. He has resorted to stoking anti-Muslim sentiments to fend off attempts to split his Hindu support base, only to deny his own words later. Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., is still a heavy favorite. But it is finding that the political opposition, counted out after big losses to Mr. Modi in the previous two national elections, has some fight left in it. The opposition has found traction in challenging Mr. Modi’s control over the national narrative. With the broadcast media cowed by him, opposition leaders have turned to online platforms to find an audience for a pitch focused on economic and social justice, painting the prime minister as a primary culprit in India’s growing inequality. Before the election, often-bickering opposition parties united in a grand alliance to confront a shared threat: what they call Mr. Modi’s mission to cripple them and remake the country into one-party rule. The alliance lost precious time in the months before the vote, bogged down by internal differences. But it has largely held together despite Mr. Modi’s efforts to lure away some of its members and sideline others with legal actions. The alliance hopes that this translates into an improved electoral showing, after scattered votes for opposition parties in the 2019 election worked to Mr. Modi’s advantage. To have any hope of cutting significantly into the governing party’s existing strong majority in Parliament, the opposition will have to flip a large number of seats in the more populous north, where the B.J.P. is well entrenched, and hold its ground in the more prosperous south. “The opposition realized it was now or never,” said Arati Jerath, a political analyst in New Delhi. “It had to fight Modi with all the weapons it could muster or face certain death.” Analysts say elections that focus on local issues favor the opposition. This spring, Mr. Modi has again made a parliamentary election, contested across more than 540 seats, into a presidential-style national referendum on his own huge popularity and his achievements. But it has become clear that, a decade into his rule, his ability to steer elections away from local concerns — and cover for his party’s parochial struggles and infighting — is waning. The opposition has tried to take advantage with an energized ground game. In the lead-up to the vote, Mr. Modi intensified a political crackdown. Chief ministers of two opposition-controlled states were thrown in jail, and the bank accounts of the Indian National Congress, the main opposition party, were essentially frozen. “But people started campaigning door to door, village to village, state to state. So that has become really a groundwork for the opposition,” Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the Congress party, said in an interview. “Now they are frustrated,” he added, referring to the B.J.P. The Congress party is trying to pull itself out of an immense hole. The rise of caste-based regional parties marginalized the once-dominant Congress in India’s electorally crucial north, and Mr. Modi’s ascendence set it back further. Mr. Modi, who had spent a lifetime working his way up from a humble background, easily cast the face of the Congress, Rahul Gandhi, as a detached, lightweight beneficiary of dynastic politics. Just how far the Congress is trying to distance itself from that impression is evident in its election manifesto — both in form and substance. The party’s 2019 manifesto had a fresh-faced Mr. Gandhi front and center, with a message of jobs and economic development. In the 2024 document, he wears a graying beard, a nod to the time he spent connecting with rural India during two cross-country journeys since 2022, one of them covering 2,000 miles by foot. If that was not enough, next to him is the 81-year-old Mr. Kharge, elected in 2022 as the Congress president. His half a century in politics, and his background as a Dalit at the bottom of India’s rigid caste hierarchy, helps offset Mr. Modi’s personal story. The Congress’s campaign promises — from cash transfers to poor women to a “guarantee of first jobs” for young people through one-year paid apprenticeships — shows that it has learned from its successes in India’s southern states, said Sugata Srinivasaraju, the author of a book on Mr. Gandhi’s struggles in leading his party. “This is good,” Mr. Srinivasaraju said. “But the Congress does not have any emotional or cultural argument to counter” the B.J.P., with its Hindu-nationalist ideology. The closest the Congress has come is its effort to fuse two issues: longstanding caste inequality and rising unemployment. India’s Constitution sets aside about half of government jobs and seats in higher education for the middle and lower ranks in the caste system. With the economy struggling to create enough private-sector jobs, these government positions are seen as crucial for any hope of economic mobility. The Congress’s call for a census of Indians by caste — there has been no official national data on the size of each caste for decades — appears to be striking a chord. The party says such an exercise would ensure that marginalized Indians get their rightful share of slots. That push is also furthering two charges aimed at Mr. Modi: that he has overseen an economy that benefits only billionaires, and that his party has an upper-caste bias. While it is true that the B.J.P. was once an upper-caste, urban party, Mr. Modi has broadened its base by bringing in lower castes. But his response to the charge suggests he is nervous that the label may stick. “He’s for the rich,” Mr. Kharge said at a large rally in Mumbai. “He has done nothing for the poor.” Behind Mr. Kharge were the leaders of several parties in the alliance, each of whom would draw on a grievance to depict Mr. Modi as dangerous for India. One of them, Arvind Kejriwal, made a particularly personal case that Mr. Modi is trying to turn the country into something like Russia under President Vladimir V. Putin — “one nation, one leader.” “I am coming straight from jail,” Mr. Kejriwal began his speech. His Aam Aadmi Party holds power in the Delhi region and in the northern state of Punjab. Its expansion is a threat to Mr. Modi, whose government arrested Mr. Kejriwal over corruption allegations just before the election, creating the absurd reality in which India’s capital was being run from a jail cell. Mr. Kejriwal managed to get a three-week bail during the campaigning. As he jumps from rally to rally across the country, his connection with crowds makes clear why Mr. Modi would have liked to keep him behind bars. In Mumbai, he painted India under Mr. Modi as a dystopia where anyone who gets in the prime minister’s way will be locked up. Mr. Kejriwal said he had been kept under the surveillance of multiple cameras in jail — “watching what time I wake up, what time I go to the bathroom, how long I sit on the toilet.” Then he made his final appeal. This election, he said, is a vote for either keeping him in jail or restoring his freedom. He will be watching the results on June 4 from his cell. “You can write me letters,” he said. “Cell No. 25, Jail No. 2, Tihar Jail.”",prime minister narendra modi entered india general election

nytimes,Strangers in Their Own Land: Being Muslim in Modi’s India,"May 18, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/18/world/asia/muslims-india.html,"It is a lonely feeling to know that your country’s leaders do not want you. To be vilified because you are a Muslim in what is now a largely Hindu-first India. It colors everything. Friends, dear for decades, change. Neighbors hold back from neighborly gestures — no longer joining in celebrations, or knocking to inquire in moments of pain. “It is a lifeless life,” said Ziya Us Salam, a writer who lives on the outskirts of Delhi with his wife, Uzma Ausaf, and their four daughters. When he was a film critic for one of India’s main newspapers, Mr. Salam, 53, filled his time with cinema, art, music. Workdays ended with riding on the back of an older friend’s motorcycle to a favorite food stall for long chats. His wife, a fellow journalist, wrote about life, food and fashion. Now, Mr. Salam’s routine is reduced to office and home, his thoughts occupied by heavier concerns. The constant ethnic profiling because he is “visibly Muslim” — by the bank teller, by the parking lot attendant, by fellow passengers on the train — is wearying, he said. Family conversations are darker, with both parents focused on raising their daughters in a country that increasingly questions or even tries to erase the markers of Muslims’ identity — how they dress, what they eat, even their Indianness altogether. One of the daughters, an impressive student-athlete, struggled so much that she needed counseling and missed months of school. The family often debates whether to stay in their mixed Hindu-Muslim neighborhood in Noida, just outside Delhi. Mariam, their oldest daughter, who is a graduate student, leans toward compromise, anything to make life bearable. She wants to move. Anywhere but a Muslim area might be difficult. Real estate agents often ask outright if families are Muslim; landlords are reluctant to rent to them. “I have started taking it in stride,” Mariam said. “I refuse to,” Mr. Salam shot back. He is old enough to remember when coexistence was largely the norm in an enormously diverse India, and he does not want to add to the country’s increasing segregation. But he is also pragmatic. He wishes Mariam would move abroad, at least while the country is like this. Mr. Salam clings to the hope that India is in a passing phase. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, is playing a long game. His rise to national power in 2014, on a promise of rapid development, swept a decades-old Hindu nationalist movement from the margins of Indian politics firmly to the center. He has since chipped away at the secular framework and robust democracy that had long held India together despite its sometimes explosive religious and caste divisions. Right-wing organizations began using the enormous power around Mr. Modi as a shield to try to reshape Indian society. Their members provoked sectarian clashes as the government looked away, with officials showing up later to raze Muslim homes and round up Muslim men. Emboldened vigilante groups lynched Muslims they accused of smuggling beef (cows are sacred to many Hindus). Top leaders in Mr. Modi’s party openly celebrated Hindus who committed crimes against Muslims. On large sections of broadcast media, but particularly on social media, bigotry coursed unchecked. WhatsApp groups spread conspiracy theories about Muslim men luring Hindu women for religious conversion, or even about Muslims spitting in restaurant food. While Mr. Modi and his party officials reject claims of discrimination by pointing to welfare programs that cover Indians equally, Mr. Modi himself is now repeating anti-Muslim tropes in the election that ends early next month. He has targeted India’s 200 million Muslims more directly than ever, calling them “infiltrators” and insinuating that they have too many children. This creeping Islamophobia is now the dominant theme of Mr. Salam’s writings. Cinema and music, life’s pleasures, feel smaller now. In one book, he chronicled the lynchings of Muslim men. In a recent follow-up, he described how India’s Muslims feel “orphaned” in their homeland. “If I don’t pick up issues of import, and limit my energies to cinema and literature, then I won’t be able to look at myself in the mirror,” he said. “What would I tell my kids tomorrow — when my grandchildren ask me what were you doing when there was an existential crisis?” As a child, Mr. Salam lived on a mixed street of Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims in Delhi. When the afternoon sun would grow hot, the children would move their games under the trees in the yard of a Hindu temple. The priest would come with water for all. “I was like any other kid for him,” Mr. Salam recalled. Those memories are one reason Mr. Salam maintains a stubborn optimism that India can restore its secular fabric. Another is that Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalism, while sweeping large parts of the country, has been resisted by several states in the country’s more prosperous south. Family conversations among Muslims there are very different: about college degrees, job promotions, life plans — the usual aspirations. In the state of Tamil Nadu, often-bickering political parties are united in protecting secularism and in focusing on economic well-being. Its chief minister, M.K. Stalin, is a declared atheist. Jan Mohammed, who lives with his family of five in Chennai, the state capital, said neighbors joined in each other’s religious celebrations. In rural areas, there is a tradition: When one community finishes building a place of worship, villagers of other faiths arrive with gifts of fruits, vegetables and flowers and stay for a meal. “More than accommodation, there is understanding,” Mr. Mohammed said. His family is full of overachievers — the norm in their educated state. Mr. Mohammed, with a master’s degree, is in the construction business. His wife, Rukhsana, who has an economics degree, started an online clothing business after the children grew up. One daughter, Maimoona Bushra, has two master’s degrees and now teaches at a local college as she prepares for her wedding. The youngest, Hafsa Lubna, has a master’s in commerce and within two years went from an intern at a local company to a manager of 20. Two of the daughters had planned to continue on to Ph.D’s. The only worry was that potential grooms would be intimidated. “The proposals go down,” Ms. Rukhsana joked. A thousand miles north, in Delhi, Mr. Salam’s family lives in what feels like another country. A place where prejudice has become so routine that even a friendship of 26 years can be sundered as a result. Mr. Salam had nicknamed a former editor “human mountain” for his large stature. When they rode on the editor’s motorcycle after work in the Delhi winter, he shielded Mr. Salam from the wind. They were together often; when his friend got his driver’s license, Mr. Salam was there with him. “I would go to my prayer every day, and he would go to the temple every day,” Mr. Salam said. “And I used to respect him for that.” A few years ago, things began to change. The WhatsApp messages came first. The editor started forwarding to Mr. Salam some staples of anti-Muslim misinformation: for example, that Muslims will rule India in 20 years because their women give birth every year and their men are allowed four wives. “Initially, I said, ‘Why do you want to get into all this?’ I thought he was just an old man who was getting all these and forwarding,” Mr. Salam said. “I give him the benefit of doubt.” The breaking point came two years ago, when Yogi Adityanath, a Modi protégé, was re-elected as the leader of Uttar Pradesh, the populous state adjoining Delhi where the Salam family lives. Mr. Adityanath, more overtly belligerent than Mr. Modi toward Muslims, governs in the saffron robe of a Hindu monk, frequently greeting large crowds of Hindu pilgrims with flowers, while cracking down on public displays of Muslim faith. On the day of the vote counting, the friend kept calling Mr. Salam, rejoicing at Mr. Adityanath’s lead. Just days earlier, the friend had been complaining about rising unemployment and his son’s struggle to find a job during Mr. Adityanath’s first term. “I said, ‘You have been so happy since morning, what do you gain?’” he recalled asking the friend. “Yogi ended namaz,” the friend responded, referring to Muslim prayer on Fridays that often spills into the streets. “That was the day I said goodbye,” Mr. Salam said, “and he hasn’t come back into my life after that.”",lonely feeling know country leader want vilified muslim largely hindufirst india color everything friend dear decade

nytimes,La diplomacia de Musk: cautivar a la derecha mundial para beneficiarse,"May 16, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/05/16/espanol/elon-musk-lideres-mundiales-tesla-beneficios.html,"Unos minutos después de que se hizo evidente que Javier Milei había sido elegido presidente del segundo país más grande de América del Sur, en noviembre, Elon Musk publicó en la red social X (antes conocida como Twitter): “La prosperidad está por venir en Argentina”. Desde entonces, Musk ha seguido usando X, la red social de la que es dueño, para alentar a Milei. El multimillonario ha compartido videos en los que el presidente argentino ataca la “justicia social” con sus 182 millones de seguidores. Musk ha ayudado a convertir al belicoso libertario en uno de los nuevos rostros de la derecha moderna. Pero fuera de línea, ha aprovechado esta relación para ejercer presión y obtener beneficios para sus otras empresas, la fabricante de automóviles eléctricos Tesla y la constructora de cohetes espaciales SpaceX. “Me llamó Elon Musk”, afirmó Milei en una entrevista por televisión unas semanas después de asumir el cargo. “Está sumamente interesado en el litio”. Musk ha declarado que el litio —el elemento blanco-plateado que es el principal componente de las baterías de los autos de Tesla— es “el nuevo petróleo”. Tesla lleva mucho tiempo comprándole litio a Argentina, que es el segundo país con mayores reservas. Ahora, Milei presiona para que las mineras internacionales de litio reciban beneficios importantes, lo que probablemente le daría a Tesla un flujo más estable —y quizá más barato— de uno de los recursos más vitales para la empresa. Milei se ajusta a un patrón que sigue Musk de fomentar relaciones con una constelación de jefes de Estado de derecha, con beneficiarios muy claros: él mismo y sus empresas. Musk, de 52 años, ha utilizado en repetidas ocasiones una pieza de su imperio empresarial —la red social X— para expresar su apoyo a políticos como Milei, Jair Bolsonaro de Brasil y Narendra Modi de India. En la plataforma, Musk ha respaldado sus posturas en temas de género, ha celebrado su oposición al socialismo y ha confrontado con agresión a sus enemigos. Musk incluso cambió personalmente las políticas de contenido de la plataforma X de una forma que pareció beneficiar a Bolsonaro, según dijeron dos exempleados de la plataforma. Musk, a su vez, ha presionado y obtenido ventajas corporativas para sus empresas más lucrativas, Tesla y SpaceX, según un análisis de The New York Times. En India, logró que se le cobraran aranceles menores por la importación de los vehículos de Tesla. En Brasil, abrió un importante mercado nuevo para Starlink, el servicio de internet por satélite de SpaceX. En Argentina, aseguró el acceso al mineral más crucial para las baterías de Tesla. El respaldo de Musk les ha dado a muchos jefes de Estado nacionalistas y de derecha más prestigio internacional, el cual no han dudado en promocionar como una validación de sus políticas y popularidad. Musk, Tesla, SpaceX y la plataforma X no respondieron a nuestras solicitudes de comentarios. En septiembre de 2015, Musk recibió a Modi en la fábrica de Tesla en Fremont, California. Modi, político nacionalista indio, había sido electo primer ministro de India un año antes, cuando su partido, Bharatiya Janata, arrasó para llegar al poder, y visitaba Estados Unidos para reunirse con líderes empresariales. Musk y Modi posaron para las fotos cerca de un flamante automóvil rojo Model S. Comentaron que los “paneles solares y las baterías” podrían brindar electricidad a regiones rurales de India sin necesidad de líneas eléctricas, señaló Musk en ese entonces. “Comprendí su visión”, dijo más tarde Modi. Fue una de las primeras instancias en que Musk sostuvo una reunión en público con un líder nacionalista. Además, fue el principio de un plan a largo plazo con Modi, relación que tardó años en desarrollar y comenzó a redituarle a Musk después de que compró Twitter.. India podría ser un mercado masivo para Tesla, que necesita incursionar en regiones nuevas para crecer. Pero ese país prácticamente prohibió los vehículos eléctricos construidos por fabricantes extranjeros. En años recientes, los aranceles impuestos en India a los vehículos eléctricos importados han aumentado hasta un 100 por ciento. Musk recurrió en un principio a la diplomacia personal tradicional: se reunió con Modi y les ordenó a los empleados de Tesla estrechar relaciones con algunos funcionarios. Después de que Musk compró Twitter en 2022, aprovechó su nueva palanca. La plataforma, renombrada como X, se utiliza ampliamente en India —hasta Modi lo hace y tiene casi 98 millones de seguidores— y es un foro importante de debate político. Musk se reunió en persona con Modi de nuevo en junio pasado, cuando el primer ministro visitó Nueva York. Se identificó como “fan de Modi” y afirmó que Modi estaba “alentándonos a hacer inversiones significativas en India, algo que planeamos hacer”. Para entonces, los empleados de Tesla de nuevo sostenían conversaciones con los asesores de Modi sobre una reducción de los aranceles y una inversión en India, según indicaron dos personas familiarizadas con las conversaciones. Rohan Patel, quien era vicepresidente de política pública y desarrollo comercial de Tesla, viajó a India en varias ocasiones. Por su parte, Piyush Goyal, ministro de Comercio de India, visitó la fábrica de Fremont en noviembre. En enero, Musk publicó en X que India debería recibir un lugar permanente en el Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas, lo que reforzaría la posición internacional de India. “Que India no tenga un lugar permanente en el Consejo de Seguridad, a pesar de ser el país más poblado del planeta, es absurdo”, escribió Musk. Todo parece indicar que Modi se percató del comentario. Dos meses después, India anunció que había decidido reducir algunos aranceles de importación para los fabricantes de automóviles eléctricos que se comprometieran a asignar por lo menos 500 millones de dólares a la producción de vehículos en el país. La política redujo los aranceles del 100 al 15 por ciento del precio de cada automóvil, específicamente para los vehículos eléctricos con un precio superior a 35.000 dólares. La descripción se ajusta a Tesla a la perfección. Sus automóviles Model 3 tienen un precio de 38.990 dólares. Para 2021, Musk ya aplicaba una táctica similar para introducir el servicio de internet de su red de satélites Starlink en Brasil, gobernado en ese entonces por Bolsonaro, presidente populista de derecha elegido tres años antes. En esa época, Starlink estaba en pañales, con menos de 150.000 usuarios en 25 países. En octubre de 2021, Fábio Faria, ministro de Comunicaciones de Brasil y uno de los organizadores de la campaña de reelección de Bolsonaro, le envió una carta a Musk en la que le decía que “Starlink y Brasil pueden ser excelentes aliados”, según consta en correspondencia obtenida por las leyes de transparencia de información del país. Semanas más tarde, Faria visitó a Musk en Texas. Tras su regreso a Brasil, Faria presionó a los reguladores para que aprobaran a Starlink. En cierto momento, instó a la agencia espacial de Brasil a mantenerse al margen de cualquier debate sobre los satélites de SpaceX en el país, según testificó más adelante ante el Congreso Nacional de Brasil. Los reguladores de Brasil aprobaron la operación de Starlink en diciembre de 2021, siete meses después de presentada la primera solicitud del servicio. Fue la más rápida de las cinco aprobaciones que los reguladores les otorgaron a prestadores de servicios de internet por satélite. Musk ayudó más tarde a Bolsonaro, cuando enfrentó una difícil batalla en su campaña de 2022 por la reelección. El 20 de mayo de ese año, Musk hizo un viaje sorpresa a Brasil para hacer un anuncio importante con el presidente. Starlink iba a llegar al país y planeaba ofrecerles acceso a internet a 19.000 escuelas rurales, además del monitoreo ambiental de la Amazonía, según indicaron durante un evento en un complejo hotelero cerca de São Paulo. Bolsonaro le entregó a Musk una medalla y lo llamó una “verdadera leyenda de nuestra libertad” por su oferta de ese año para comprar Twitter.. Pero solo había un inconveniente: el plan de ofrecerles conexión a las escuelas nunca se concretó, explicó Carlos Baigorri, principal regulador de telecomunicaciones de Brasil, quien ayudó a aprobar el ingreso de Starlink en el país. “En realidad no creo que siquiera haya existido”, comentó acerca del plan. Musk y Bolsonaro se beneficiaron de cualquier manera. Musk había atrincherado a SpaceX en un mercado vital, en el que Starlink tiene ahora 150.000 cuentas activas, según la reguladora de telecomunicaciones de Brasil. La campaña de Bolsonaro logró promover la agudeza comercial del presidente y presentarlo como defensor de la Amazonía antes de las elecciones. El favor de Musk no evitó que Bolsonaro perdiera la presidencia ante Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, expresidente de izquierda de Brasil, en octubre de 2022. Pero en unas semanas, Musk, que acababa de concretar su acuerdo para comprar Twitter, intentó de nuevo ayudar a Bolsonaro. Los partidarios de Bolsonaro habían comenzado a impulsar acusaciones en Twitter de que algunos jueces brasileños habían inclinado la balanza en las elecciones cuando les ordenaron a las redes sociales eliminar publicaciones y cuentas con ideología de derecha. Mientras estaban instalados frente a bases militares para exigir la anulación de las elecciones, Musk alimentó sus sospechas dando a entender que los antiguos jefes de Twitter habían contribuido a la derrota de Bolsonaro. “Es posible que algunos empleados de Twitter les hayan dado preferencia a los candidatos de izquierda”, publicó en diciembre de 2022, sin mencionar ninguna evidencia. Más tarde, escribió que la empresa “quizá tenga personas en el equipo de Brasil con un fuerte sesgo político”. En 2022, uno de los proveedores de litio de Tesla anunció una inversión de 1100 millones de dólares para ampliar sus operaciones en Argentina. Desde entonces, Musk ha mostrado gran interés en la política argentina ―particularmente en Milei―, lo que ha generado uno de los bromances o “romance entre hermanos” más evidentes entre las relaciones políticas de Musk. Milei, economista libertario y comentarista de televisión, promovió durante su campaña la idea de sacar al gobierno de la economía y establecer una relación más estrecha entre Argentina y Estados Unidos. Al igual que Musk, insulta con frecuencia a sus críticos, tiene un hábito intenso con las redes sociales y está muy preocupado por la amenaza de la cultura progre. Unos días antes de la toma de posesión de Milei en diciembre, hablaron directamente por primera vez y Musk le preguntó sobre el litio de Argentina. En los meses posteriores, Milei ha impulsado legislación que haría mucho más atractiva la extracción de litio en Argentina para los inversionistas extranjeros. Su proyecto legislativo de gran envergadura, que le otorgaría, durante el año próximo, amplias facultades en situación de emergencia sobre la economía y la energía de Argentina, incluye un gran beneficio para Tesla: incentivos significativos para inversionistas extranjeros con proyectos grandes, en especial en la industria minera. Esas empresas recibirían recortes fiscales sustanciales, exenciones de impuestos aduaneros y beneficios de cambio de divisas, así como certidumbre fiscal y regulatoria por un periodo de 30 años. Es probable que califique el proveedor de litio de Tesla. En tal caso, el plan de Milei le daría a Tesla una estabilidad y predictibilidad inusuales en cuanto a su acceso a litio en Argentina por lo menos hasta 2054. La propuesta fue aprobada en la cámara baja del Congreso de Argentina el 30 de abril. Musk ya ha visto otros dividendos de Milei. En uno de sus primeros actos como presidente, Milei aprobó una orden ejecutiva con 366 disposiciones. Cuando sintetizó los puntos clave de la orden en un discurso por televisión, Milei mencionó solo una marca corporativa específica: Starlink. SpaceX había intentado lograr la aprobación de Starlink en Argentina desde 2022, pero estaba en un atolladero burocrático. Milei no tardó en reducir las regulaciones aplicables al internet por satélite, lo que le permitió a Starlink arrancar operaciones en el país en marzo.",unos minutos despus de que se hizo evidente que

nytimes,The Scrappy World War II Pilots Who Took Flight for a Perilous Mission,"May 14, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/books/review/skies-of-thunder-caroline-alexander.html,"“You and your outfit have been assigned one of the most important military missions ever given to American soldiers — the task of driving the Japanese back to Tokyo.” So begins “A Pocket Guide to India,” prepared for World War II service members in the western base section of the China-Burma-India Theater, commonly known as the C.B.I. “India is a strange, colorful land,” the guide continues. “If you exercise a normal amount of curiosity you’ll learn much that is fascinating; much that will enable you to begin stories to your children or grandchildren in later years, ‘Now, when I was in India. …’” If the guide seems to protest too much, perhaps that’s because the C.B.I. was, as Caroline Alexander explains in her riveting new book, “Skies of Thunder,” under-resourced, improvisational and rife with smugglers, its actual purpose murkier than its symbolic value. It was the war’s “most chaotic theater,” she writes, marked by “competing interests, and contradictions that exposed the fault lines between the Allies.” To some stationed there, C.B.I. stood for “Confusion Beyond Imagination.” My father, who served as an air traffic controller in the C.B.I., didn’t recall reading the “Pocket Guide,” but he did tell me stories of working in Delhi and Agra, a vital supply depot and service point, and traveling to various locations to lay radio-range beacons. The main point of these activities, he explained, was to enable pilots to fly supplies over the Himalayas to China. While it was always easy for me to picture my father in his control tower, those flights over the mountains remained mysterious until I read Alexander’s vivid account. Alexander, the author of books on Shackleton’s Endurance expedition and the fateful voyage of the Bounty, begins with the Allied loss of Burma to the Japanese in April 1942, which sealed off the ground supply corridor from India to China and led to the opening of an “aerial Burma Road.” This treacherous route, known as “the Hump,” supplied Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist government and Allied troops, including the 14th Air Force, commanded by the flamboyant Claire Chennault. Alexander casts her story as an “epic,” yet it is one in which the actors suffer like Job more often than they fight like Achilles. There are stirring episodes of British sang-froid, “American-style glamour” and remarkable courage among the region’s remote tribal peoples, but it is perseverance that assumes heroic proportions: refugees escaping through the Burmese jungle; soldiers and local laborers hacking through that same jungle to build a new road; Assam airfield personnel living in squalor, seared by the sun, swamped by monsoons, but most of all shrouded in a “miasma of cynical indifference.” What unites this book with the author’s previous work is a fascination with human behavior in extremis. While Alexander devotes considerable space to strategic and political issues, her interest lies primarily in the vicissitudes of individual human personality. In places she represents the theater’s dysfunction as a tragicomedy of failed relationships at the highest levels of command: between the mercurial Chiang Kai-shek and the American Joseph Stilwell, the theater’s irascible, insecure commanding general; between Stilwell and the unscrupulous, self-aggrandizing Chennault; between Stilwell and the British allies he loathed. Alexander’s gift for dramatizing these personal animosities occasionally produces seductive yet oversimplified biographical explanations of historical problems, a mode E.H. Carr described as “the Bad King John theory of history.” Ultimately, and rightly, the pilots — intrepid as “sailors of old” crossing “unknown oceans” — are the core of the book. Demeaned as “Hump drivers,” ostensible noncombatants at the bottom of the aviation hierarchy, they flew an inadequately charted route over baffling terrain, its surreality intensified by their frequent refusal to wear oxygen masks. Alexander adroitly explicates technical concepts — flight mechanics, de-icing, night vision — but is at her best rendering pilots’ fear. Besides terrain, its sources included weather, enemy aircraft, insufficient training, night missions and “short rations of fuel” on the return leg. At least a pilot could depend on his plane, the beloved Douglas C-47 Skytrain, until the introduction of unreliable or unsound higher-capacity models turned the machines themselves into another source of terror. Readers thrilled by sagas of flight will marvel at the logistics required to transport a stunning 650,000 tons of cargo by air, the audacity required to fly the Hump, the search-and-rescue operations necessitated by its hazards and the experimental use of aviation involved in the Allied recapture of Burma in 1944. They will also have to reckon with Alexander’s hard-nosed conclusions about the C.B.I. Others who have chronicled its history concentrated on the strategic merits of this deeply imperfect theater, or celebrated its pioneering use of air power. The image that dominates the end of Alexander’s epic is “the aluminum trail” of wreckage — “the hundreds of crashed aircraft that still lie undiscovered in the jungles, valleys and fractured ranges beneath the Hump’s old route.”",outfit assigned one important military mission ever given american soldier task driving japanese back tokyo begin pocket guide india prepared world war ii service member western base section chinaburmaindia theater commonly known cbi india strange colorful land guide continues exercise normal amount curiosity youll learn much fascinating much enable begin story child grandchild later year india guide seems protest much perhaps thats cbi caroline alexander explains riveting new book sky thunder underresourced improvisational rife smuggler actual purpose murkier symbolic value war chaotic theater writes marked competing interest contradiction exposed fault line ally stationed cbi stood confusion beyond imagination father served air traffic controller cbi didnt recall reading pocket guide tell story working delhi agra vital supply depot service point traveling various location lay radiorange beacon main point activity explained enable pilot fly supply himalaya china always easy picture father control tower flight mountain remained mysterious read alexander vivid account alexander author book shackletons endurance expedition fateful voyage bounty begin allied loss burma japanese april sealed ground supply corridor india china led opening aerial burma road treacherous route known hump supplied chiang kaisheks nationalist government allied troop including th air force commanded flamboyant claire chennault alexander cast story epic yet one actor suffer like job often fight like achilles stirring episode british sangfroid americanstyle glamour remarkable courage among region remote tribal people perseverance assumes heroic proportion refugee escaping burmese jungle soldier local laborer hacking jungle build new road assam airfield personnel living squalor seared sun swamped monsoon shrouded miasma cynical indifference unites book author previous work fascination human behavior extremis alexander devotes considerable space strategic political issue interest lie primarily vicissitude individual human personality place represents theater dysfunction tragicomedy failed relationship highest level command mercurial chiang kaishek american joseph stilwell theater irascible insecure commanding general stilwell unscrupulous selfaggrandizing chennault stilwell british ally loathed alexander gift dramatizing personal animosity occasionally produce seductive yet oversimplified biographical explanation historical problem mode eh carr described bad king john theory history ultimately rightly pilot intrepid sailor old crossing unknown ocean core book demeaned hump driver ostensible noncombatant bottom aviation hierarchy flew inadequately charted route baffling terrain surreality intensified frequent refusal wear oxygen mask alexander adroitly explicates technical concept flight mechanic deicing night vision best rendering pilot fear besides terrain source included weather enemy aircraft insufficient training night mission short ration fuel return leg least pilot could depend plane beloved douglas c skytrain introduction unreliable unsound highercapacity model turned machine another source terror reader thrilled saga flight marvel logistics required transport stunning ton cargo air audacity required fly hump searchandrescue operation necessitated hazard experimental use aviation involved allied recapture burma also reckon alexander hardnosed conclusion cbi others chronicled history concentrated strategic merit deeply imperfect theater celebrated pioneering use air power image dominates end alexander epic aluminum trail wreckage hundred crashed aircraft still lie undiscovered jungle valley fractured range beneath hump old route,2.0,neutral,0
nytimes,14 Killed as Storm Topples Huge Billboard in India,"May 13, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/world/asia/mumbai-india-storm-deaths.html,"Fourteen people were killed in a suburb of Mumbai, India’s financial capital, on Monday as strong winds from a storm caused the collapse of a huge billboard that officials said had been erected without permission. At least 64 people were injured in the collapse, and rescue workers were searching for more survivors trapped under the debris on Tuesday morning. Videos on social media showed the billboard shaking in the storm before falling on a gas station. An eyewitness, Sunil Gaikwad, said he and his wife had taken shelter with dozens of others in the gas station, on a busy road in the Ghatkopar area, when the rain and wind worsened. Within minutes, he said, the billboard toppled onto the gas station and a parking area. “All of us were stuck for hours before people came and saved us,” Mr. Gaikwad said from a Mumbai hospital, where he was being treated for minor injuries. “It was like a huge building falling on top of us.” Mumbai, home to more than 18 million people, is prone to severe flooding and rain-related accidents during the monsoon season, which runs roughly from June to September. Last year, a landslide triggered by torrential rains killed at least 16 people in Maharashtra, the state that includes Mumbai. Across India, more than 2,000 people were killed last year because of floods and rain-related incidents during the monsoon season, according to data from India’s federal home ministry. Eknath Shinde, the chief minister of Maharashtra, ordered officials to check all billboard structures in Mumbai. His deputy, Devendra Fadnavis, said the government had opened an investigation into the collapse. The rains on Monday were followed by dust storms. The authorities at the Mumbai airport said they had diverted more than a dozen inbound flights and suspended operations for more than an hour. Though the rains brought some relief from the sweltering heat, many parts of the city were inundated, and there were large traffic jams.",fourteen people killed suburb mumbai india financial capital monday strong wind storm caused collapse huge billboard official said erected without permission least people injured collapse rescue worker searching survivor trapped debris tuesday morning video social medium showed billboard shaking storm falling gas station eyewitness sunil gaikwad said wife taken shelter dozen others gas station busy road ghatkopar area rain wind worsened within minute said billboard toppled onto gas station parking area u stuck hour people came saved u mr gaikwad said mumbai hospital treated minor injury like huge building falling top u mumbai home million people prone severe flooding rainrelated accident monsoon season run roughly june september last year landslide triggered torrential rain killed least people maharashtra state includes mumbai across india people killed last year flood rainrelated incident monsoon season according data india federal home ministry eknath shinde chief minister maharashtra ordered official check billboard structure mumbai deputy devendra fadnavis said government opened investigation collapse rain monday followed dust storm authority mumbai airport said diverted dozen inbound flight suspended operation hour though rain brought relief sweltering heat many part city inundated large traffic jam,-18.0,negative,2
nytimes,Elon Musk’s Diplomacy: Woo Right-Wing World Leaders. Then Benefit.,"May 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/technology/elon-musk-world-leaders.html,"Minutes after it became clear that Javier Milei had been elected president of South America’s second-largest nation in November, Elon Musk posted on X: “Prosperity is ahead for Argentina.” Since then, Mr. Musk has continued to use X, the social network he owns, to boost Mr. Milei. The billionaire has shared videos of the Argentine president attacking “social justice” with his 182 million followers. One doctored image, which implied that watching a speech by Mr. Milei was better than having sex, is among Mr. Musk’s most viewed posts ever. Mr. Musk has helped turn the pugnacious libertarian into one of the new faces of the modern right. But offline, he has used the relationship to press for benefits to his other businesses, the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX. “Elon Musk called me,” Mr. Milei said in a television interview weeks after taking office. “He is extremely interested in the lithium.” Mr. Musk has declared lithium — the silvery-white element that is the main component in Tesla’s car batteries — “the new oil.” Tesla has long bought lithium from Argentina, which has the world’s second-largest reserves. Now Mr. Milei is pushing for major benefits for international lithium miners, which would likely give Tesla a more stable — and potentially cheaper — flow of one of its most critical resources. Mr. Milei is part of a pattern by Mr. Musk of fostering relationships with a constellation of right-wing heads of state, with clear beneficiaries: his companies and himself. Mr. Musk, 52, has repeatedly used one piece of his business empire — X, formerly known as Twitter — to vocally support politicians like Mr. Milei, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Narendra Modi of India. On the platform, Mr. Musk has backed their views on gender, feted their opposition to socialism and aggressively confronted their enemies. Mr. Musk even personally intervened in X’s content policies in ways that appeared to aid Mr. Bolsonaro, two former X employees said. Mr. Musk, in turn, has pushed for and won corporate advantages for his most lucrative businesses, Tesla and SpaceX, according to an examination by The New York Times. In India, he secured lower import tariffs for Tesla’s vehicles. In Brazil, he opened a major new market for Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite internet service. In Argentina, he solidified access to the mineral most crucial to Tesla’s batteries. Mr. Musk’s endorsement has given many nationalist and right-wing heads of state more international cachet, which they have eagerly promoted as a validation of their policies and popularity. Last month, as India began holding an election, Mr. Modi prepared to host Mr. Musk in New Delhi, calling the billionaire’s visit a testament to his leadership. “People are coming, and they are trusting me,” the Indian prime minister said in a televised interview before Mr. Musk postponed his trip. Mr. Musk, Tesla, SpaceX and X did not respond to requests for comment. No other American megabillionaire businessperson has so publicly fostered ideological relationships with world leaders to advance personal politics and businesses. Bill Gates, Microsoft’s co-founder turned philanthropist, engaged in political diplomacy largely after stepping back from corporate life. Other chief executives typically stay quiet about meetings with politicians. Mr. Musk’s politics have long been guided by his businesses, said five former Tesla and SpaceX executives who worked closely with him and were not authorized to speak publicly. In the 2010s, he built an alliance with President Barack Obama as Tesla and SpaceX welcomed federal assistance and contracts. He remains close to some mainstream leaders, notably President Emmanuel Macron of France. But as populism and nationalism spread, Mr. Musk courted Xi Jinping in China and supported Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni. He began criticizing the “woke mind virus” and what he has declared the failings of the left, which he says have led to issues such as illegal immigration and declining birthrates. “I guess if you consider fighting the woke mind virus, which I consider to be a civilizational threat, to be political, then yes,” Mr. Musk said in a podcast in November when asked if he was becoming more political. “Woke mind virus is communism rebranded.” In September 2015, Mr. Musk welcomed Mr. Modi to Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif. Mr. Modi, a Hindu nationalist politician, had been elected India’s prime minister a year earlier when his Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power, and was visiting the United States to meet business leaders. Standing under Indian and U.S. flags at the factory, Mr. Musk and Mr. Modi posed for photographs near a gleaming red Model S car. They discussed how “solar panels and battery packs” could power rural regions in India without electrical lines, Mr. Musk said at the time. “I understood his vision,” Mr. Modi later said. It was one of the first instances of Mr. Musk’s publicly meeting a nationalist leader. And it was the beginning of a long game between him and Mr. Modi, a relationship that took years to develop — and that started paying off for Mr. Musk after he bought X. India is a potentially massive market for Tesla, which needs to expand to new regions to grow. But the country has virtually barred electric vehicles built by foreign manufacturers. In recent years, the tariff India imposes on imported electric vehicles has risen as high as 100 percent. Mr. Musk initially used traditional personal diplomacy, meeting with Mr. Modi and ordering his staff at Tesla to get close to officials. In 2017, Tesla sent a letter to India’s government to kick-start talks on operating in the country. Another overture to Mr. Modi’s government in 2019 was rebuffed, three people with knowledge of the company said. After Mr. Musk bought Twitter in 2022, he had a new lever. The platform, renamed X, is widely used in India — including by Mr. Modi, who has nearly 98 million followers — and is a major forum of political discussion. Before Mr. Musk owned the platform, Twitter tangled with Mr. Modi’s government. The company, which complies with requests to block certain content in India, had sued the government and challenged its power to censor online material. Under Mr. Musk, X blocked posts last year that linked to a BBC documentary examining Mr. Modi’s role in the 2002 Hindu-Muslim riots in Gujarat, where he was the chief minister at the time. Twitter’s lawsuit against the Indian government was dismissed in July. In a discussion last year with Twitter employees, Mr. Musk intimated that he was personally close with Mr. Modi. He said he could easily call the prime minister to take care of a content issue, two former employees said. It’s unclear if any conversation took place. Mr. Musk met Mr. Modi in person again last June when the prime minister visited New York. He called himself a “fan of Modi” and said Mr. Modi was “pushing us to make significant investment in India, which is something that we intend to do.” By then, Tesla employees were again talking with Mr. Modi’s advisers about a reduction in tariffs and investing in India, two people familiar with the conversations said. Rohan Patel, who was Tesla’s vice president of public policy and business development, traveled to India several times, and Piyush Goyal, India’s commerce minister, visited the Fremont factory in November. In January, Mr. Musk posted on X that India should receive a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, which would boost India’s international standing. “India not having a permanent seat on the Security Council, despite being the most populous country on Earth, is absurd,” he wrote. The timing suggests that Mr. Modi noticed. Two months later, India announced it was reducing some import duties for electric carmakers that committed at least $500 million to produce vehicles in the country. The policy dropped tariffs to 15 percent of a car’s price from 100 percent, specifically for electric vehicles that retail for more than $35,000. The description fit Tesla to a T. Its Model 3 cars ship at $38,990. BYD, the fast-growing Chinese electric vehicle maker, is barred from investing in India on national security grounds. Last month, Tesla scouted potential factory sites in three Indian states, three people familiar with the process said. Mr. Musk had also said he would visit Mr. Modi in New Delhi during the country’s multiweek general election, before delaying the trip, citing obligations with Tesla. Mr. Musk promised not to stay away for long. “I do very much look forward to visiting later this year,” he wrote on X. By 2021, Mr. Musk was employing a similar courtship to bring his Starlink satellite internet service to Brazil, which was then led by Mr. Bolsonaro, the right-wing populist president elected three years earlier. At the time, Starlink was in its infancy, with fewer than 150,000 users across 25 countries. In October 2021, Fábio Faria, Brazil’s communications minister and an organizer of Mr. Bolsonaro’s re-election campaign, sent a letter to Mr. Musk, saying that “Starlink and Brazil can become great partners,” according to correspondence obtained through the country’s open records laws. Weeks later, Mr. Faria visited Mr. Musk in Texas. After returning to Brazil, Mr. Faria pushed regulators to approve Starlink, at one point urging Brazil’s space agency to stay out of any debate about SpaceX’s satellites over the country, he later testified to Brazil's Congress. Brazil’s regulators approved Starlink for operation in December 2021, seven months after the service first applied. It was the fastest of five approvals that regulators granted to satellite internet providers. Mr. Musk later lent a hand to Mr. Bolsonaro, who faced an uphill battle in his 2022 re-election campaign. On May 20 that year, Mr. Musk made a surprise trip to Brazil for a major announcement alongside the president. Starlink was coming to the country, and it would provide internet connectivity to 19,000 rural schools, as well as environmental monitoring of the Amazon, they said at an event in a resort near São Paulo. Mr. Bolsonaro gave Mr. Musk a medal and called him a “true legend of freedom” for his bid that year to buy Twitter. There was just one catch: The plan to connect schools never materialized, said Carlos Baigorri, Brazil’s chief telecommunications regulator, who helped approve Starlink’s entry into the country. “I don’t really think that it even existed,” he said of the plan. Brazilian officials said they had no record of Starlink’s connecting Brazilian schools for free or conducting environmental monitoring. Mr. Musk and Mr. Bolsonaro benefited anyway. Mr. Musk had entrenched SpaceX in a critical market, where Starlink now has 150,000 active accounts, according to Brazil’s telecommunications regulator. Mr. Bolsonaro’s campaign got to promote the president’s business acumen and cast him as a defender of the Amazon before an election. Mr. Musk’s favor did not prevent Mr. Bolsonaro from losing the presidency to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s leftist former president, in October 2022. But within weeks, Mr. Musk, who had just completed his deal for Twitter, tried helping Mr. Bolsonaro again. Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters had started pushing accusations on Twitter that Brazilian judges had tilted the election by ordering social networks to remove right-wing posts and accounts. As they camped outside military bases demanding the election be overturned, Mr. Musk fed their suspicions by suggesting that Twitter’s former bosses had contributed to Mr. Bolsonaro’s defeat. “It’s possible that Twitter personnel gave preference to left wing candidates,” he posted in December 2022, without citing any evidence. He later wrote that the company “may have people on the Brazil team that are strongly politically biased.” Mr. Musk got involved in deciding which posts about Brazil’s election results should stay up or be taken down, two former Twitter employees said. Even after Mr. Musk was briefed about the risk of violence in Brazil that winter, he ordered employees to stop enforcing Twitter’s election rules in the country, including a policy forbidding users to spread misleading claims about election results, they said. He told them to remove only posts that directly incited violence or were subject to a court order. In January 2023, thousands of Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters stormed Brazil’s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices, under the false belief that the election had been stolen. Mr. Musk has since used X to attack one of Mr. Bolsonaro’s main political opponents, Alexandre de Moraes, a Brazilian Supreme Court justice who has overseen investigations into the former president and his supporters. X has blocked more than 100 accounts on orders from Justice Moraes, who has said many of them threatened Brazil’s democracy. “This judge has brazenly and repeatedly betrayed the constitution and people of Brazil,” Mr. Musk posted on X in April. “He should resign or be impeached.” At a rally called by Mr. Bolsonaro in Rio de Janeiro last month, his supporters held signs thanking Mr. Musk. When Mr. Bolsonaro addressed the crowd, he hailed the billionaire as “the man who really preserves true freedom for us all.” In 2022, one of Tesla’s lithium suppliers announced a $1.1 billion investment to expand in Argentina. Since then, Mr. Musk has taken a keen interest in Argentine politics — and particularly Mr. Milei — leading to one of the most pronounced bromances among Mr. Musk’s political relationships. Mr. Milei “would be quite a change,” Mr. Musk wrote on X in September in response to a post from the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who had called the then-candidate “Argentina’s next president.” Mr. Milei, a libertarian economist and TV pundit, campaigned on getting the government out of the economy and tying Argentina more closely to the United States. Like Mr. Musk, he frequently insults critics, has an intense social media habit and is deeply worried about the threat from “woke” culture. Days before Mr. Milei’s inauguration in December, they spoke directly for the first time, and Mr. Musk asked about Argentina’s lithium. In the months since, Mr. Milei has been pushing legislation that would make extracting Argentina’s lithium far more attractive to foreign investors. His sweeping bill, which would grant him broad emergency powers over Argentina’s economy and energy for the next year, includes a major benefit for Tesla: significant incentives for foreign investors in large projects, particularly in mining. Such companies would receive substantial tax cuts, customs exemptions and foreign-exchange benefits, as well as tax and regulatory certainty for the next 30 years. Tesla’s lithium supplier is likely to qualify. If so, Mr. Milei’s plan would give Tesla unusual stability and predictability in its access to lithium in Argentina until at least 2054. The proposal passed Argentina’s lower chamber of Congress on April 30. Mr. Musk has already seen other dividends from Mr. Milei. In one of his first acts as president, Mr. Milei passed an executive order with 366 provisions. When summarizing the highlights of the order in a televised address, Mr. Milei mentioned just one corporate brand by name: Starlink. SpaceX had pushed for Starlink’s approval in Argentina since 2022, but faced a bureaucratic jam. Mr. Milei quickly cut regulations on satellite internet, and Starlink began operating in the country in March. Mr. Milei, in turn, has benefited: Mr. Musk has become his most influential online promoter. In January, Mr. Musk shared videos of Mr. Milei’s speech at the World Economic Forum, in which the leader claimed communism and social justice were the main threats to the West. The posts set off a frenzy of praise for the Argentine across right-wing corners of the internet, including from Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who met with Mr. Milei in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington. Mr. Milei hugged Mr. Trump and told him he was rooting for him. Last month, Mr. Milei traveled to Austin, Texas, to visit Mr. Musk at Tesla’s factory there. The two men agreed to “open markets and defend the ideas of freedom,” according to a statement from Mr. Milei’s office. The statement did not mention lithium. Later, Gerardo Werthein, Argentina’s ambassador to the United States, told the Argentine newspaper La Nación that the pair had indeed discussed Argentina’s mineral reserves. Mr. Musk “had a very good view of everything we have,” Mr. Werthein said, “especially lithium.” On Monday, Mr. Musk and Mr. Milei met again, this time at a conference in Los Angeles. Mr. Milei called the entrepreneur “my friend” in a speech in which he praised Mr. Musk’s effort to reach Mars. A few hours later, Mr. Musk posted a photo of the two men with their thumbs up. “I recommend investing in Argentina,” he wrote.",minute became clear javier milei elected president south america

nytimes,"At Cannes, Indian Filmmakers Show There Is More Than Just Bollywood","May 11, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/11/movies/cannes-film-festival-india.html,"For the first time in 30 years at the Cannes Film Festival, an Indian film will compete for the Palme d’Or in the main competition, alongside new movies from Francis Ford Coppola, Yorgos Lanthimos and Andrea Arnold. The dry spell might come as a surprise for a country with film industries in multiple regions producing hundreds of films per year, including international sensations like last year’s Oscar-nominated “RRR.” But the inclusion of “All We Imagine as Light,” directed by Payal Kapadia, reflects a growing recognition of the independent cinema made in the shadow of the country’s mainstream hits. Thierry Frémaux, the artistic director of Cannes, noted the new generations of filmmakers in India when he announced the lineup in April. These movies offer what the critic Namrata Joshi calls “a young, probing, and provoking gaze at Indian reality.” Indian publications have celebrated the country’s prominent presence at the festival, whose inaugural edition in 1946 included a film from India, Chetan Anand’s “Neecha Nagar,” in its grand prize category. “All We Imagine as Light” joins a generally notable selection of Indian stories and storytellers across this year’s edition, which begins on Tuesday. Santosh Sivan will be the first Indian filmmaker to receive the Pierre Angénieux prize for career achievement in cinematography, and in the Un Certain Regard competition, Sandhya Suri’s “Santosh” follows a widow who takes on her husband’s policeman post. In Directors’ Fortnight, a parallel program during Cannes, Karan Kandhari’s “Sister Midnight” portrays a defiant newly married woman who seeks vengeance. And in ACID (Association for the Distribution of Independent Cinema) — a parallel program at Cannes devoted to independent film — an Indian feature will screen for the first time, “In Retreat,” directed by Maisam Ali. “It’s great because quite often we don’t have so many films from India represented in this way at Cannes,” Kapadia said in an interview from Paris where she was putting finishing touches on her film. Centering on two roommates, “All We Imagine as Light” is, Kapadia says, “about women who’ve come to Mumbai to work.” She returns to Cannes after winning best documentary in 2021 for her university-set reflection on love and protest, “A Night of Knowing Nothing.” But independent Indian productions can face a long road to screens at home because of domestic funding challenges and markets more accustomed to mainstream fare. “If you want to do something that’s a little experimental, it becomes challenging to find funding,” Kapadia said. “There are a few funds, but it’s a really big country and there are a lot of people.” Despite the obstacles, Indian films of modest budgets and artistic ambition have won awards abroad recently in major festivals like Sundance, “All That Breathes” in 2022; Rotterdam, “Pebbles” in 2021; and Venice, “The Disciple” in 2020. The Museum of Modern Art in New York opened a 2022 showcase of independent movies from India by proclaiming: “Indian cinema’s diversity has been energized by a growing number of impressive independent works.” And documentaries have especially garnered the spotlight recently with Academy Award nominations, including “All That Breathes” and “Writing with Fire,” despite having no consistent theatrical distribution within India. “I think the spirit of independent films in India has always been strong,” Deepti DCunha, artistic director of the Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival, said. “But very few people have the access and they can find it difficult to get their movies seen anywhere.” What’s helped many Indian filmmakers are co-productions with European countries, and the chance to get exposure to potential producers at the annual Film Bazaar, an event in Goa with a curated market for Indian films, producers and programmers visiting from abroad, and work-in-progress labs. But another nexus for a recent generation of independent filmmakers is film school. The Film and Television Institute of India (F.T.I.I.) in Pune, which Kapadia attended, is one such bastion, as is Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi. “The F.T.I.I. has provided an indefatigable supply of not only technicians in terms of editors, sound people, D.O.P.s [directors of photography] and so on, but also directors,” Shaunak Sen, who directed “All That Breathes,” said in an interview from Delhi. Sen counts himself lucky: his film about two brothers running a bird clinic in Delhi went to Sundance, Cannes and the Oscars, and was picked up by HBO. But he sees what independent filmmakers can face in India, “where you know you’re staring at this mammoth industry of Bollywood, working in a tiny nook, and trying to will a film into existence.” Kapadia’s film was in development since late 2018, taking time to find funding. She was writing the script for “All We Imagine as Light” while she was still making her documentary “A Night of Knowing Nothing.” The F.T.I.I. was central to Kapadia’s career, and where she met her partner, whom she also works with, and other “go-to film companions.” But an international connection was important: She worked on both films with a young French company, learning together as they moved from small documentary production to a sometimes 80-person crew for “All We Imagine as Light.” (“Big crew, small film!” she said with a laugh.) The French co-production also had support from the Netherlands through the Hubert Bals Fund of the International Film Festival Rotterdam, which supports filmmakers across the globe at various stages of creating their movies. “The independent film industry in Europe is really well designed. They support you at every stage,” Kapadia said, listing off grants for script writing, production, postproduction and distribution. She mused what it would be like if India could adopt the French system of levying taxes on ticket sales that can be used to support independent filmmaking. (She’s not alone in wondering: An editorial in the Indian Express said Kapadia’s inclusion offered “an opportunity to introspect on why it has taken three decades for a film from one of the world’s top film-producing nations to once again make it to this eminent stage.”) These are the challenges that filmmakers like Kapadia must master, not just to make their movies but to find audiences. Programmers at international festivals can help with encouraging independent voices, viewing works in progress in India or through links. In the case of the ACID selection, “In Retreat,” the filmmaker Ali (another F.T.I.I. graduate) submitted the film, which was one of hundreds considered by the programming team. Shot in the high-altitude Ladakh region, it’s the story of a middle-aged man trying to return home to a mountain town for his brother’s funeral. “I didn’t know the director was young, because when you see the film, it’s incredibly deep, really mature,” Pamela Varela, one of ACID’s programmers, said, before bestowing the highest auteurist compliment. “This is really a film by someone. You see it from the first sequence, which is amazing.” The up-and-coming generations of Indian independent filmmakers share a willingness to experiment formally and, outside of the demands of a studio and mass market, might have more freedom to confront political issues of inequality or caste, for example. “Especially if it’s a French co-production,” Kapadia said with a smile. “They are very much for free speech, so they are quite supportive of whatever you want to do.” These filmmakers find kinship both at home and abroad. Kapadia compared making films to “making a quilt, a craft” and mentioned the Indian filmmakers Yashaswini Raghunandan and Ekta Mittal. Like cinephiles globally, filmmakers are in tune with directors from across the world, though Sen also cited the particular “neighborly” bond with other South Asian cinemas that reflect a postcolonial modernity. When it comes to the independent “new wave,” though, don’t call it a comeback: By all accounts, the talent was always there. Cannes just presents a dazzlingly bright spotlight and opportunity. “I don’t think it is that we have recently seen a new wave in talent,” DCunha said. “It’s more that now Europe is paying attention, or America’s paying attention.”",first time year cannes film festival indian film compete palme dor main competition alongside new movie francis ford coppola yorgos lanthimos andrea arnold dry spell

nytimes,Canadian Arrests Highlight Alleged Gang Role in India’s Intelligence Operations,"May 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/world/asia/canada-india-sikh-arrests-gangs.html,"Months after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada accused India’s government of plotting a murder on Canadian soil — plunging diplomatic relations between the two countries to their lowest level ever — the first arrests in the killing, which came on Friday, did little to demystify the basis of his claim. The police didn’t offer clues or present any evidence that India had orchestrated the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh nationalist leader who was gunned down at the temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia, in June. What they did say was that three Indian men had committed the killing and that an investigation into India’s role was ongoing. Before the arrests, Indian officials had maintained that Canada was trying to drag New Delhi into what it described as essentially a rivalry between gangs whose members were long wanted for crimes back in India. After the arrests, a report from the CBC, Canada’s public broadcasting corporation, based on anonymous sources, also said the suspects belonged to an Indian criminal gang. But analysts and former officials said that the possible role of a gang in the killing does not necessarily mean the Indian government was not involved in the crime. India’s external spy agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, or RAW, has long been suspected of tapping into criminal networks to carry out operations in its immediate neighborhood in South Asia while maintaining deniability. Canada’s accusation, if proven, that India orchestrated the Nijjar killing — and a similar accusation made soon after by the United States in a different case — may suggest that RAW is now extending its playbook of working with criminals to carry out operations in Western countries, analysts said. U.S. officials have produced strong evidence in their accusation that an agent of the Indian government participated in a foiled attempt to assassinate a dual American-Canadian citizen. And Canada and allied officials have maintained that Canada has evidence supporting Mr. Trudeau’s claim that Indian agents carried out Mr. Nijjar’s killing. But the Canadian failure to reveal any evidence that India took part, nine months after Mr. Trudeau’s explosive allegation, leaves the killing of Mr. Nijjar in the realm of accusations and counter-accusation in what is a highly tense political environment in both countries, analysts said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been flexing his muscles as a nationalist strongman, pitching himself during his ongoing campaign for a third-term in office as a protector of India who would go as far as it takes to target security threats. During speeches, he has boasted about how his government eliminates enemies by “descending in their homes.” While he has made those references in relation to the country’s archenemy — Pakistan — right wing accounts on social media had celebrated the slaying of Mr. Nijjar in Canada as a similar reach of Mr. Modi’s long arm. Mr. Trudeau, on the other hand, had been facing criticism of weakness in the face of Chinese election interference activities on Canadian soil, and his getting ahead of the Nijjar killing was seen as compensating for that. Canadian police announced on Friday that they had arrested the three Indian men in Edmonton, Alberta, the same day and charged them with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the killing of Mr. Nijjar. The suspects had been living in Canada for three to five years but were not permanent residents of Canada, the police said. The gang that the CBC reported that the hit-men are connected to is led by Lawrence Bishnoi, 31, who is accused of several cases of murder, extortion and narcotics trafficking. He has orchestrated much of it from an Indian jail, where he has been held since 2014. His members are seen as being behind the murder of a popular Punjabi rapper, and threats of attacks on Bollywood celebrities. Indian security officials have frequently arrested criminals connected to Mr. Bishnoi, often with allegations that the gang’s network stretched as far as Canada and overlapped with those promoting from Canadian soil the cause of Khalistan, a once deeply violent separatist movement with the goal of carving out the Indian state of Punjab as an independent nation. A large Sikh diaspora resides in Canada, many of them having migrated there after a violent and often indiscriminate crackdown by the Indian government in the 1980s against the movement for an independent Khalistan. While the cause has largely died down inside India, it continues to have supporters among some segments of the diaspora. The Indian government has accused Canada, and several other Western countries, of not doing enough to crack down on the separatists. Analysts and former security officials said that in India’s immediate geographic neighborhood, RAW has often been willing to venture into murky spaces to recruit killers. Senior officials of Mr. Modi’s administration, including Ajit Doval, the storied former spymaster who now serves as his longtime national security adviser, have in the past been accused of reaching into the underworld to find hit men willing to go after targets both inside the country as well as abroad. Mr. Bishnoi has demonstrated enormous power from behind bars, even giving a television interview from jail last year to pitch himself as a nationalist warrior rather than a criminal mastermind. That, one former security official said, was a signal of his trying to align himself with the spirit of nationalism for a potential deal. “I am a nationalist,” Mr. Bishnoi said in that interview. “I am against Khalistan. I am against Pakistan.” Ajai Sahni, a security analyst who runs the South Asia Terrorism Portal in New Delhi, said the exploitation of criminal gangs by spy agencies to carry out operations with deniability was something that “happens all over the world.” “It is definitely possible for agencies like RAW to use gang rivalries instead of exposing their own covert operators,” Mr. Sahni added. “But just because that is generally how one would expect it to be done, it doesn’t necessarily mean we know this is exactly the case in Nijjar’s killing.” The failed plot on American soil had some of the sloppy hallmarks of an agency trying to extend an old playbook into a different, unfamiliar space. A U.S. indictment in November laid out evidence, including electronic communication and cash transactions between the hired hit man — who turned out to be an undercover cop — a boastful middleman, and an Indian intelligence handler whom The Washington Post recently identified as Vikram Yadav. The Indian government’s response suggested worry: India’s top diplomat said the action was not government policy, while the government announced an investigation into the matter and promised cooperation with the United States. Canada’s case has played out very differently. The country has not publicly disclosed any evidence backing up Mr. Trudeau’s claim, even as allied officials said in September that Canadian officials had found a “smoking gun”: intercepted communications of Indian diplomats in Canada indicating involvement in the plot. Indian officials have pushed back against Mr. Trudeau’s claims with the kind of aggression that suggested it either wasn’t involved or that it was confident of its deniability. The Indian government expelled Canadian diplomats, and doubled down by putting out a list of individuals on Canadian soil that it said were long wanted as part of what it described as a crime and terror nexus. Last week, officials in Mr. Modi’s government jumped on scenes of an event that Mr. Trudeau had attended to say it showed his accusations were simply to appease what they say is a Sikh vote bank for him. They pointed to videos of an event where Mr. Trudeau was the chief guest and where chants of “long live Khalistan” were shouted. Mr. Trudeau, in his speech, said he will always be there “to protect your rights and your freedoms, and we will always defend your community against hatred.” After the speech, the Indian foreign ministry summoned Canada’s second highest ranking diplomat in New Delhi to lodge a complaint. “His remarks to us illustrates once again the kind of political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism and people who practice violence,” Randhir Jaiswal, the foreign ministry spokesman, said at a news conference.",month prime minister justin trudeau canada accused india

nytimes,Biden Calls Japan and India ‘Xenophobic’ in Defending U.S. Immigration,"May 2, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/us/politics/biden-japan-india-immigration.html,"For months, President Biden has been under pressure to prove he can be tough at the border. But at a campaign reception on Wednesday night, he also tried to voice his commitment to America’s long history of immigration. He did so by taking a swipe at two of America’s partners, saying that Japan and India are struggling economically “because they’re xenophobic.” He said the two democratic countries, along with China and Russia, “don’t want immigrants.” “Immigrants are what makes us strong,” the president told the crowd of supporters. “Not a joke. That’s not hyperbole, because we have an influx of workers who want to be here and want to contribute.” The comments have the potential to be a diplomatic irritant for the administration, which has spent years courting the governments of both Japan and India as part of the president’s strategy to counter Chinese aggression in the region. Japan and India are two of the five allies Mr. Biden has hosted with state dinners at the White House since taking office. John F. Kirby, the national security spokesman at the White House, told reporters Thursday that Mr. Biden was trying to make a comment about America’s immigrant “DNA,” not insult other countries. And he insisted that officials in India and Japan understand that. “Our allies and partners know well in tangible ways how President Biden values them, their friendship, their cooperation,” Mr. Kirby said. But the president’s comments also underscore how Mr. Biden is trying to find a politically palatable balance on immigration as he seeks a second term in the White House. In response to anger from Republicans and Democrats about historic surges of migrants at the southern border, the president signed off on the most restrictive immigration legislation in years. That legislation stalled in Congress, but now Mr. Biden is considering whether to use his executive power to enact a severe crackdown on asylum on his own. At the same time, Mr. Biden is trying to assert the moral high ground on the country’s treatment of migrants by drawing a contrast with former President Donald J. Trump and his yearslong assault on immigration. During the 2020 campaign, Mr. Biden repeatedly attacked Mr. Trump for supporting what he called racist and xenophobic policies. On his first day in office, Mr. Biden proposed a comprehensive overhaul of the nation’s immigration system that would have expanded rights for immigrants. Many advocates for immigrants have said they expected explicit support for what the president called a “humane” approach to immigration to continue in Mr. Biden’s White House. But the reality has been more complicated. As the situation on the border worsened, demands for tougher action grew — even from the president’s Democratic allies in big cities like Chicago, New York and Denver. While Mr. Biden has proposed new legal options for some migrants to enter the United States, his policies and rhetoric have become more forceful. In January, as Congress was considering the immigration legislation, Mr. Biden said he was eager to use it to shut down the border. “If given that authority,” he said, “I would use it the day I sign the bill into law.” Maribel Hernández Rivera, the director of policy and government affairs for the border and immigration at the A.C.L.U., said Thursday that she hoped the president’s comments at the fund-raiser indicated that he was reconsidering some of those tougher proposals. “The first thing he did was propose immigration reform, right? So that was a good thing,” she said, referring to Mr. Biden’s early actions as president. “We also, unfortunately, have seen other policies that are not helpful, such as trying to limit asylum, access to asylum for vulnerable people.” She added: “Banning asylum in any way goes against both international and national domestic laws. That is not the solution.” On Thursday, Mr. Kirby sought to emphasize that the president believed in the importance of immigration to the economic success of the United States. “Look, I think the broader point that the president was making, and I think people all around the world recognize this, that the United States is a nation of immigrants and it’s in our DNA,” he said. “We’re better for it. We’re stronger for it. We’re not going to walk away from it. And that’s the broader point that he would make.”",month president biden pressure prove tough border campaign reception wednesday night also tried voice commitment america long history immigration taking swipe two america partner saying japan india struggling economically theyre xenophobic said two democratic country along china russia dont want immigrant immigrant make u strong president told crowd supporter joke thats hyperbole influx worker want want contribute comment potential diplomatic irritant administration spent year courting government japan india part president strategy counter chinese aggression region japan india two five ally mr biden hosted state dinner white house since taking office john f kirby national security spokesman white house told reporter thursday mr biden trying make comment america immigrant dna insult country insisted official india japan understand ally partner know well tangible way president biden value friendship cooperation mr kirby said president comment also underscore mr biden trying find politically palatable balance immigration seek second term white house response anger republican democrat historic surge migrant southern border president signed restrictive immigration legislation year legislation stalled congress mr biden considering whether use executive power enact severe crackdown asylum time mr biden trying assert moral high ground country treatment migrant drawing contrast former president donald j trump yearslong assault immigration campaign mr biden repeatedly attacked mr trump supporting called racist xenophobic policy first day office mr biden proposed comprehensive overhaul nation immigration system would expanded right immigrant many advocate immigrant said expected explicit support president called humane approach immigration continue mr bidens white house reality complicated situation border worsened demand tougher action grew even president democratic ally big city like chicago new york denver mr biden proposed new legal option migrant enter united state policy rhetoric become forceful january congress considering immigration legislation mr biden said eager use shut border given authority said would use day sign bill law maribel hernndez rivera director policy government affair border immigration aclu said thursday hoped president comment fundraiser indicated reconsidering tougher proposal first thing propose immigration reform right good thing said referring mr bidens early action president also unfortunately seen policy helpful trying limit asylum access asylum vulnerable people added banning asylum way go international national domestic law solution thursday mr kirby sought emphasize president believed importance immigration economic success united state look think broader point president making think people around world recognize united state nation immigrant dna said better stronger going walk away thats broader point would make,22.0,positive,0
nytimes,"When My Mom Got Sick, This TV Show Kept Us Going","May 1, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/magazine/indian-idol-cancer.html,"Every family has its archetypes, so here’s mine: My dad and my brother and I are all miserable. None of us are quick to experience joy, and all for different reasons — my dad is irritable, my brother is anxious and I’m bitter. The three of us combined could make one moderately unwell person. Instead, we are planets that orbit a sun more optimistic than we could ever be, and we hope that some of that shine rubs off on us periodically. My mother believes in a positive ethos: that things invariably will improve, that everyone is trying their best, that it’s better to be surprised by harm than anticipating it all the time. In April 2023, I was laid off from my job, and she reassured me immediately. “Everything always works out,” she said. But for the first time, I noticed a slash of worry run across her face. It looked as if she was losing her radiance. I later learned that my mother had been hiding something important from my brother and me for a month: She’d had a biopsy to determine if she had breast cancer. Within weeks of her 69th birthday, she had a lumpectomy. The doctors told her she would need an exhausting surgery, and then exhaustive radiation. For a little under a year, she went through treatment, and steadily she changed — she became sour, nihilistic and impenetrably dark, just like the rest of us. I had never seen it before, and I didn’t know what to do with it other than try to change her mind. Who was this woman? Every few weeks I’d fly home to find my mother again. Cancer robbed my mom of most pleasures. Food was rendered tasteless at best and inedible at worst; she’d push a plate of cheese and crackers away like a child, pantomiming vomiting at every meal. Radiation gave her brain fog, so it was challenging for her to follow along in a book or a movie. She didn’t find anything on TV funny anymore. She didn’t find me very funny either. She was morose and weepy no matter what the day looked like. In her displeasure, she found only blips of joy. Rummy after lunch, a heating pad on the breast, wearing a mastectomy bra that I lied about and said was given to me free in order to avoid arguing about the cost. But nothing brought her consistent pleasure like the Hindi version of “American Idol.” New episodes aired twice a week, and we would record it and watch after dinner. Only during “Indian Idol” was she upright, eyes peeled, singing along. Having just wrapped its 14th season, “Indian Idol” has been on since 2004 and has aired 179 episodes. On the South Asian TV channel my parents paid a premium for (“This,” I used to grumble as a kid, “but not Cartoon Network?”), reruns seemed to play daily, for months. “How come no one is getting kicked off?” I asked my mom after seeing the same contestants on the show for three weeks straight. “Oh, it takes a while,” she said, which was a big deal. It was always a big deal when she spoke at all. “Everyone always seems to get the same number of votes.” If you watch “American Idol” — or “Canadian Idol,” as I did growing up — you’ll know that the most interesting parts of the show are the brutal, often cruel criticisms contestants face. But that doesn’t happen on “Indian Idol,” where every competitor is genuinely one of the most amazing singers you’ve ever heard (the show typically features contestants who very capably sing a catalog of vocally demanding Bollywood tunes). The show is structured in such a way that weeks can go by without an elimination — there are noncompetitive audition and coaching phases which stretch for long periods. Viewers, it seems, appreciate the chance to watch months and months of really excellent karaoke, no matter who wins at the end. I don’t like reality competition shows, but I grew to appreciate “Indian Idol.” I valued the repetition, week after week — the rules didn’t make sense, the music was redundant and there was no real tension. When I watched with my mom, the judges hardly spoke an ill word about anyone’s performance. In fact, there was no friction at all. The worst thing the show did was engage in some vague poverty porn, portraying most of its contestants as low-income desperates who think of nothing but family and religion. But I was grateful for the absence of conflict. We tuned in to a world where everyone was a winner. In the episodes we watched together, all the contestants survived another week. It was that sameness of “Indian Idol” that anchored us as we navigated the unpredictable reality of her illness: Would my mother eat today? Would her pain be so debilitating that she would wail through the afternoon? Would she sleep? Would the drugs make lucidity impossible? Is today a day for her, or for her cancer? Who cares! During “Indian Idol,” I could coax her with a THC edible or two, maybe a piece of fruit. Her eyes would open. We could forget that we had lost the routine we used to take for granted. My mother just turned 70, and is now in remission. I flew back home to see her for her birthday. She refused most of my overtures: no big party, no big banquet, no big attention. “Dim sum might be nice,” she said about a dinner reservation for just us, our sun and her ugly little planets. It was the first time since her diagnosis that food sounded like it could offer her pleasure again. I can trick myself into believing things can remain this way. We have so few guarantees in life, but there are two I know for sure: My mother, for now, is cancer-free; and this week, no one’s going to be kicked off “Indian Idol.”",every family archetype here mine dad brother miserable none u quick experience joy different reason dad irritable brother anxious im bitter three u combined could make one moderately unwell person instead planet orbit sun optimistic could ever hope shine rub u periodically mother belief positive ethos thing invariably improve everyone trying best better surprised harm anticipating time april laid job reassured immediately everything always work said first time noticed slash worry run across face looked losing radiance later learned mother hiding something important brother month shed biopsy determine breast cancer within week th birthday lumpectomy doctor told would need exhausting surgery exhaustive radiation little year went treatment steadily changed became sour nihilistic impenetrably dark like rest u never seen didnt know try change mind woman every week id fly home find mother cancer robbed mom pleasure food rendered tasteless best inedible worst shed push plate cheese cracker away like child pantomiming vomiting every meal radiation gave brain fog challenging follow along book movie didnt find anything tv funny anymore didnt find funny either morose weepy matter day looked like displeasure found blip joy rummy lunch heating pad breast wearing mastectomy bra lied said given free order avoid arguing cost nothing brought consistent pleasure like hindi version american idol new episode aired twice week would record watch dinner indian idol upright eye peeled singing along wrapped th season indian idol since aired episode south asian tv channel parent paid premium used grumble kid cartoon network rerun seemed play daily month come one getting kicked asked mom seeing contestant show three week straight oh take said big deal always big deal spoke everyone always seems get number vote watch american idol canadian idol growing youll know interesting part show brutal often cruel criticism contestant face doesnt happen indian idol every competitor genuinely one amazing singer youve ever heard show typically feature contestant capably sing catalog vocally demanding bollywood tune show structured way week go without elimination noncompetitive audition coaching phase stretch long period viewer seems appreciate chance watch month month really excellent karaoke matter win end dont like reality competition show grew appreciate indian idol valued repetition week week rule didnt make sense music redundant real tension watched mom judge hardly spoke ill word anyones performance fact friction worst thing show engage vague poverty porn portraying contestant lowincome desperate think nothing family religion grateful absence conflict tuned world everyone winner episode watched together contestant survived another week sameness indian idol anchored u navigated unpredictable reality illness would mother eat today would pain debilitating would wail afternoon would sleep would drug make lucidity impossible today day cancer care indian idol could coax thc edible two maybe piece fruit eye would open could forget lost routine used take granted mother turned remission flew back home see birthday refused overture big party big banquet big attention dim sum might nice said dinner reservation u sun ugly little planet first time since diagnosis food sounded like could offer pleasure trick believing thing remain way guarantee life two know sure mother cancerfree week one going kicked indian idol,28.0,positive,0
nytimes,India’s Master of Nostalgia Takes His Sweeping Vision to Netflix,"May 1, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/world/asia/netflix-heeramandi-bhansali.html,"In the small Bombay theater that showed big films, his father brought him — over and over again — to see the biggest of them all. With every one of his 18 viewings of “Mughal-e-Azam,” a hit 1960 musical about a forbidden romance between a prince and a courtesan, the young boy fell more in love. The rays of light, beamed in black and white, opened to him a world at once majestic and lost. The dialogue, crisp and poetic, lingered in his thoughts. The music swept him to places that only later in life would he fully understand. Bombay would eventually change, to Mumbai. India, cinema and music — they would all change, too. But more than half a century later, Sanjay Leela Bhansali — now 61 and a rare remaining master of the grand old style of Indian filmmaking — has not let go of his seat at that small cinema, Alankar Talkies, on the hem of the city’s red-light district. His mind remains rooted there even as his work moves beyond the theater walls. His latest project, released on Wednesday, is an eight-episode musical drama on Netflix that gives a “Game of Thrones” treatment to an exalted milieu of courtesans in pre-independence India. The show, “Heeramandi,” affords more space for Mr. Bhansali’s expansive and exacting approach than any two-hour movie. But it also presents a tricky challenge. How, with big-budget texture and color, do you bring the splendor and grandiosity of royalty — in his imagination, the courtesans lived like queens — to an audience that, at least in his home country of India, will largely be watching on tiny mobile screens? One answer is technical: more close-up shots. The other is personal: a vision all his own. With his decades of commercial success, he has the license to hold tight to the kind of cinema — song-filled nostalgia mixed with obsessive attention to light and detail — he fell in love with early, and forever. “I am still in Alankar Talkies,” he said in an interview last summer, between shoots. “I am seeing it on that big screen over there.” Outside, Mumbai was drenched in monsoon rains. Inside, under the hangar that covered the three-acre set, Mr. Bhansali was lost in a city born as much of imagination as research. Hundreds of workers had toiled for nearly 10 months to create his Lahore of the early 1900s. The furniture was vintage. The curtains and the miniature patterns on the corridor walls were hand-painted, then aged. The slogans on the city walls, the store signs — all calligraphy, aged and faded. When his friend Moin Beg brought him a 14-page concept for the project about 20 years ago, Mr. Bhansali sat on it. There were too many characters, too many things going on, for a feature film. In the years that followed, Mr. Bhansali felt as if he was training himself “to handle big scale.” He made successful films — more recently in a shrinking environment for artistic expression that made him the subject of violent attack — that dealt with dancing girls and royal courts. A consistent theme was complex, powerful, beautiful women. Another big step: He began creating the music for his own movies. Some of his deepest artistic questions since childhood were triggered by music. Through music came a belief that any artist is a 200-year-old or 300-year-old soul. The artistic process is a slow discovery of what the soul already knows. Inside Alankar Talkies, the boy would forget about the actors on the screen and be transported by the voice of the Indian singer Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. “Somewhere, the soul started responding to it,” he said, “‘that I kind of understand this, I know where my father is trying to take me because I’ve traveled somewhere in the past.’” His heart was set on “Heeramandi” because so much came together in one world: refined taste, classical music and dance, power politics and powerful women. Before independence in 1947, India was a collection of princely states under British rule. Elite patronage had given rise to quarters of courtesans, and an ecosystem of music, dance and fashion grew around them. Heeramandi was one such place in the city of Lahore, which after India’s partition became part of Pakistan. The Urdu-language writer Shorish Kashmiri described Heeramandi even in its decline as “an art gallery where the nights remain awake and the days sleep.” The Netflix series captures a Heeramandi where the courtesans know they are the last of their kind. But in Mr. Bhansali’s vision, their end is not a slow march to nothingness. He merges the women into the whirlwind of India’s freedom movement. “I always grant my characters a lot more than they actually deserved in life,” he said. “I wanted them to be bathed in fountains — big corridors and big mirrors, so that the reflections seem larger than life.” On his sets, it is complete surrender to a vision that keeps changing in Mr. Bhansali’s head. Some actors have described his process as torturous, his temper difficult. Others have likened it to film school. “What my role started as, and what it became — a lot of it happened on paper, and a lot of it happened on the set,” said Sonakshi Sinha, a lead actress in the series. Ms. Sinha was shooting two small segments that day. First was the final bit of a song. In its climax, Ms. Sinha’s character sways through a crowd of party guests in her drawing room, toward her veranda, drink in hand. She stares at a rival madam across the street, raises her glass and tosses it down. In take after take, Mr. Bhansali drove a point home: Every move, every gesture, had to be done so that the eyes, the glare, remained the focus. “If you arrive and just pour, then there is no joy,” he told Ms. Sinha. “Take a beat.” The segment they shot next demonstrated how Mr. Bhansali thinks, and how he obsesses. It was supposed to be simple: Ms. Sinha’s character would put out some candles, symbolizing a closing down at Heeramandi so the courtesans could join the freedom fight. During a bathroom break, Mr. Bhansali walked past a chandelier. As he stood at the urinal, he had a new vision: Ms. Sinha’s character would use a pulley to pull up the chandelier, wrapped in a drape, then walk away as the lights went out. It took five hours to light and complete the shot, for a 10-second scene. Frustrated that it was not quite right, Mr. Bhansali turned to what helps connect him to his abstraction: music. He asked an assistant to play an old song, a ghazal, on an iPad. The voice softly filled the air — then another take. When his father, a producer who never made it, was on his deathbed, he had a peculiar request: He dispatched his son to get a cassette of a tribal singer who, after India was split, had ended up on the other side, where their own family had roots. He wanted to hear the song “Hayo Raba” by Reshma — a voice raw, untrained. By the time young Sanjay returned with the cassette, his father was unconscious. He stood there watching his dilated eyes — a scene that still plays out in his mind. “He had gone into a coma,” Mr. Bhansali said. “I had no place to play ‘Hayo Rabba,’ and my mother kept saying, ‘Play “Hayo Rabba”!’” Why that song? The closest he comes to an answer is that in his father’s state of hallucination, he was connecting with his ancestors. “Life is so fascinating,” he said. “Can films ever capture this?” He has spent his life seeing if it can. When he was about 6, his father took him to a film set. He told him to wait in a corner while he talked to his friends. A cabaret was being shot. “A skimpily dressed woman was eating an apple and throwing it on a semi-naked man,” he recalled. As he looked up — to the catwalk with hanging ropes and lights and screens — he was lost in wonderment. “I realized I don’t want to be on the cricket ground, I don’t want to be in school, I don’t want to be anywhere. I want to be here. This is my place,” he said. “That woman biting that apple, throwing it on the man — I think that kid was seduced.”",small bombay theater showed big film father brought see biggest every one viewing

nytimes,Australian Journalist Says She Was Pushed Out of India,"April 24, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/world/asia/india-australia-journalist-avani-dias.html,"A senior journalist with Australia’s national broadcaster says she was effectively pushed out of India after her reporting on Sikh separatism angered the Indian government, accusing the authorities of hindering her from going to events, seeking to have her reporting taken down and refusing for weeks to renew her visa. Avani Dias, the South Asia correspondent for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, said on social media that Indian officials told her last month that her application for a resident journalist visa extension would not be approved because a television segment she had produced on accusations that India was responsible for the killing of a Sikh activist in Canada had “crossed the line.” She was eventually granted a temporary visa extension at the last minute after lobbying by the Australian government, less than a day before she was scheduled to leave the country, Ms. Dias said in her podcast, “Looking for Modi.” But she said that she ultimately decided to leave because “it felt too difficult to do my job in India.” “I was struggling to get into public events run by Modi’s party,” Ms. Dias said on the podcast, which was about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Indian government has disputed Ms. Dias’ account and said she was assured by high ranking officials that her visa would be renewed. Her departure came amid a broader crackdown on free speech in the country and raids on journalists reporting on sensitive topics. During his 10 years leading the nation, Mr. Modi has consolidated power in India and across its institutions, challenging the founding principles of modern India, like secularism and freedom of the press. He is seeking a third term in parliamentary elections that begun this month. In March, Ms. Dias produced a television segment about the accusations made by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada last year that agents acting on behalf of the Indian government were behind the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist, on Canadian soil. The half-hour documentary examined the movement, which advocates for a separate Sikh state called Khalistan to be carved out of the Indian state of Punjab. During the half-hour documentary, which was broadcast in Australia and uploaded on social media, she detailed how permission for her and her crew to film at the border between Punjab and Pakistan had suddenly been revoked by Indian officials without explanation, and how she had been quizzed by Indian officials about her crew and the places she had visited to report on the story. “It’s clear that we’re being really monitored and that there’s concern about the story that we’re doing,” she said. On March 26, less than a week after the documentary was broadcast, the Indian government successfully sought to have YouTube block the video from showing in India. The next day, Ms. Dias was told by a representative of the Ministry of External Affairs that her application for a visa extension would not be renewed, according to a person directly familiar with the situation but who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the issue. Ms. Dias notified the Australian government, and Australian diplomats began to lobby for her visa, the person said. After weeks of bureaucratic back and forth, Ms. Dias received her visa extension on the evening of Apr. 18, the person said. But with her flight back to Australia departing the next day, and having already packed up her life in India, she made the decision to leave, Ms. Dias said in her podcast. She left on the first day of voting in India’s national election. A senior Indian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, refuted her account, saying Ms. Dias had been told well in advance that her visa would be extended. The official said that Ms. Dias had violated terms of her previous visa by attempting to film at the India-Pakistan border, which requires permission. Ms. Dias previously said she had sought and been granted that permission before it was revoked at the last minute. Ms. Dias had not been prevented from covering India’s election, but had her accreditation delayed because she had not yet received her visa extension, the Indian official said, adding that her colleagues at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation had been given accreditation to cover the elections. Ms. Dias’ departure adds to mounting concerns about press freedom in India, where Indian journalists have come under heavy pressure from the Modi administration. Foreign journalists in India are reporting more pressure, as well. In February, Vanessa Dougnac, a French freelance correspondent, said she had been forced to leave India, where she had lived for 25 years, after the authorities told her that they intended to withdraw her permanent residency permit. The authorities accused her of producing reporting that was “malicious and critical in manner,” and creating a “biased negative perception about India.” They said that she had worked as a journalist without holding a valid permit, after revoking her work permit in September 2022 without a clear reason.",senior journalist australia national broadcaster say effectively pushed india reporting sikh separatism angered indian government accusing authority hindering going event seeking reporting taken refusing week renew visa avani dia south asia correspondent australian broadcasting corporation said social medium indian official told last month application resident journalist visa extension would approved television segment produced accusation india responsible killing sikh activist canada crossed line eventually granted temporary visa extension last minute lobbying australian government le day scheduled leave country m dia said podcast looking modi said ultimately decided leave felt difficult job india struggling get public event run modis party m dia said podcast prime minister narendra modi indian government disputed m dia account said assured high ranking official visa would renewed departure came amid broader crackdown free speech country raid journalist reporting sensitive topic year leading nation mr modi consolidated power india across institution challenging founding principle modern india like secularism freedom press seeking third term parliamentary election begun month march m dia produced television segment accusation made prime minister justin trudeau canada last year agent acting behalf indian government behind killing hardeep singh nijjar sikh separatist canadian soil halfhour documentary examined movement advocate separate sikh state called khalistan carved indian state punjab halfhour documentary broadcast australia uploaded social medium detailed permission crew film border punjab pakistan suddenly revoked indian official without explanation quizzed indian official crew place visited report story clear really monitored there concern story said march le week documentary broadcast indian government successfully sought youtube block video showing india next day m dia told representative ministry external affair application visa extension would renewed according person directly familiar situation spoke condition anonymity sensitive nature issue m dia notified australian government australian diplomat began lobby visa person said week bureaucratic back forth m dia received visa extension evening apr person said flight back australia departing next day already packed life india made decision leave m dia said podcast left first day voting india national election senior indian official speaking condition anonymity refuted account saying m dia told well advance visa would extended official said m dia violated term previous visa attempting film indiapakistan border requires permission m dia previously said sought granted permission revoked last minute m dia prevented covering india election accreditation delayed yet received visa extension indian official said adding colleague australian broadcasting corporation given accreditation cover election m dia departure add mounting concern press freedom india indian journalist come heavy pressure modi administration foreign journalist india reporting pressure well february vanessa dougnac french freelance correspondent said forced leave india lived year authority told intended withdraw permanent residency permit authority accused producing reporting malicious critical manner creating biased negative perception india said worked journalist without holding valid permit revoking work permit september without clear reason,-19.0,negative,0
nytimes,Why Did Modi Call India’s Muslims ‘Infiltrators’? Because He Could.,"April 23, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/world/asia/india-modi-muslims.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his power at home secured and his Hindu-first vision deeply entrenched, has set his sights in recent years on a role as a global statesman, riding India’s economic and diplomatic rise. In doing so, he has distanced himself from his party’s staple work of polarizing India’s diverse population along religious lines for its own electoral gain. His silence provided tacit backing as vigilante groups continued to target non-Hindu minority groups and as members of his party routinely used hateful and racist language, even in Parliament, against the largest of those groups, India’s 200 million Muslims. With the pot kept boiling, Mr. Modi’s subtle dog whistles — with references to Muslim dress or burial places — could go a long way domestically while providing enough deniability to ensure that red carpets remained rolled out abroad for the man leading the world’s largest democracy. Just what drove the prime minister to break with this calculated pattern in a fiery campaign speech on Sunday — when he referred to Muslims by name as “infiltrators” with “more children” who would get India’s wealth if his opponents took power — has been hotly debated. It could be a sign of anxiety that his standing with voters is not as firm as believed, analysts said. Or it could be just a reflexive expression of the kind of divisive religious ideology that has fueled his politics from the start. But the brazenness made clear that Mr. Modi sees few checks on his enormous power. At home, watchdog institutions have been largely bent to the will of his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. Abroad, partners increasingly turn a blind eye to what Mr. Modi is doing in India as they embrace the country as a democratic counterweight to China. “Modi is one of the world’s most skilled and experienced politicians,” said Daniel Markey, a senior adviser in the South Asia program at the United States Institute of Peace. “He would not have made these comments unless he believed he could get away with it.” Mr. Modi may have been trying to demonstrate this impunity, Mr. Markey said, “to intimidate the B.J.P.’s political opponents and to show them — and their supporters — just how little they can do in response.” The prime minister sees himself as the builder of a new, modern India on the march toward development and international respect. But he also wants to leave a legacy that is distinctly different from that of the leaders who founded the country as a secular republic after British colonial rule. Before joining its political offshoot, he spent more than a decade as a cultural foot soldier of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., a right-wing organization founded in 1925 with the mission of making India a Hindu state. The group viewed it as treason when an independent India agreed to a partition that created Pakistan as a separate nation for Muslims, embraced secularism and gave all citizens equal rights. A onetime member went so far as to assassinate Mohandas K. Gandhi in outrage. Over his decade in national power, Mr. Modi has been deeply effective in advancing some of the central items of the Hindu-right agenda. He abolished the semi-autonomy of the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir. He enacted a citizenship law widely viewed as prejudiced against Muslims. And he helped see through the construction of a grand temple to the Hindu deity Ram on a plot long disputed between Hindus and Muslims. The violent razing in 1992 of the mosque that had stood on that land — which Hindu groups said was built on the plot of a previous temple — was central to the national movement of Hindu assertiveness that ultimately swept Mr. Modi to power more than two decades later. More profoundly, Mr. Modi has shown that the broader goals of a Hindu state can largely be achieved within the bounds of India’s constitution — by co-opting the institutions meant to protect equality. Officials in his party have a ready rebuttal to any complaint along these lines. How could Mr. Modi discriminate against anyone, they say, if all Indian citizens benefit equally from his government’s robust welfare offerings — of toilets, of roofs over heads, of monthly rations? That argument, analysts say, is telling in showing how Mr. Modi has redefined democratic power not as leadership within checks and balances, but as the broad generosity of a strongman, even as he has redefined citizenship in practice to make clear there is a second class. Secularism — the idea that no religion will be favored over any other — has largely been co-opted to mean that no religion will be allowed to deny Hindus their dominance as the country’s majority, his critics say. Officials under Mr. Modi, who wear their religion on their sleeves and publicly mix prayer with politics, crack down on public expressions of other religions as breaching India’s secularism. While right-wing officials promote conversion to Hinduism, which they describe as a “return home,” they have introduced laws within many of the states they govern that criminalize conversion from Hinduism. Egged on by such leaders, Hindu extremists have lynched Muslim men accused of transporting cows or beef and hounded them over charges of “love jihad” — or luring Hindu women. Vigilantes have frequently barged into churches and accosted priests they believe have engaged in proselytizing or conversion. “What they have done is to create a permissive environment which encourages hate and valorizes hate,” said Harsh Mander, a former civil servant who is now a campaigner for social harmony. In reference to Mr. Modi’s speech on Sunday, he added: “This open resort to this kind of hate speech will only encourage that hard-line Hindu right in society.” Tom Vadakkan, a spokesman for the B.J.P., said the prime minister’s comments on Muslims had been misinterpreted. Mr. Modi, Mr. Vadakkan said, was referring to “intruders” or “illegal migrants” who the party claims are being used by the political opposition to “redefine the demography.” Privately, Western diplomats in New Delhi do little to hide their discomfort with some of Mr. Modi actions as a democratic ally, from the targeting of minorities to his crackdowns on opposition and dissent. But they acknowledge that he is exploiting a particularly open season in the global order, with many of their own capitals providing a less positive example than they once did, and with so much focus on China and trade deals. Mr. Markey, the Washington-based analyst, said the U.S. government was holding back from voicing concerns publicly for several reasons beyond its national interest in having India serve as an economic and geopolitical counterweight to China. The United States, he said, realizes the growing limits of its public criticism in changing partner nations’ behavior. That was demonstrated most recently by the repeated instances in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel ignored President Biden’s demands that the Israeli military change its conduct within the war in Gaza. Criticism of Mr. Modi, Mr. Markey added, could also backfire for U.S. politicians who “do not want to get crosswise with Indian diaspora groups.” But Mr. Modi may not remain immune as he pursues closer partnerships with the United States in areas like joint weapons manufacturing, transfer of high technology and sharing of intelligence. “My sense is that Washington’s increasing discomfort with Modi’s domestic politics is gradually lowering the ceiling of potential U.S. cooperation with India,” Mr. Markey said. “The question is just how far Washington is willing to trust India. Will India be treated as an ally in everything but name, or as a partner more like Vietnam or Saudi Arabia?”",prime minister narendra modi power home secured hindufirst vision deeply entrenched set

nytimes,Modi Calls Muslims ‘Infiltrators’ Who Would Take India’s Wealth,"April 22, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/world/asia/modi-speech-muslims.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday called Muslims “infiltrators” who would take India’s wealth if his opponents gained power — unusually direct and divisive language from a leader who normally lets others do the dirtiest work of polarizing Hindus against Muslims. Mr. Modi, addressing voters in the state of Rajasthan, referred to a remark once made by Manmohan Singh, his predecessor from the opposition Indian National Congress Party. Mr. Singh, Mr. Modi claimed, had “said that Muslims have the first right to the wealth of the nation. This means they will distribute this wealth to those who have more children, to infiltrators.” Mr. Modi aimed his emotional appeal at women, addressing “my mothers and sisters” to say that his Congress opponents would take their gold and give it to Muslims. Implications like these — that Muslims have too many babies, that they are coming for Hindus’ wives and daughters, that their nationality as Indian is itself in doubt — are often made by representatives of Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. Mr. Modi’s use of such language himself, as he campaigns for a third term in office, raised alarm that it could inflame right-wing vigilantes who target Muslims, and brought up questions about what had prompted his shift in communication style. Usually, Mr. Modi avoids even using the word “Muslims,” coyly finding ways to refer indirectly to India’s largest minority group, of 200 million people. Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the Congress party, called Mr. Modi’s remarks “hate speech.” Asaduddin Owaisi, who represents the only national party for Muslims, lamented how “common Hindus are made to fear Muslims while their wealth is being used to enrich others.” Tom Vadakkan, a spokesman for the B.J.P., said that Mr. Modi’s speech was being misinterpreted. “This is not about our compatriots, the Muslims,” he said. Mr. Modi was talking only about “infiltrators,” according to Mr. Vadakkan. The prime minister’s fiery oration, delivered in 100-degree heat in the town of Banswara in arid Rajasthan, marked a contrast to the image he presents in international contexts. During a visit to the White House in June, Mr. Modi said there was “no question of discrimination” in India. When he played host to the Group of 20 summit in New Delhi three months later, he chose the theme “the world is one family”(in Sanskrit, the primary liturgical language of orthodox Hinduism). He put his own face on soft-power outreach programs like World Yoga Day, broadcast to Times Square, using it to present a Hindu-centric India as a benign “teacher to the world.” Campaigns that divide Hindus and Muslims can be useful in animating the hard-right Hindu base of Mr. Modi’s otherwise broad-based electorate, especially in places like Banswara, where Hindus outnumber Muslims by three to one. With his remarks, Mr. Modi may have been trying to close a divide that has opened among Hindus in Rajasthan over whether to support the B.J.P., with one prominent group holding protests over comments made by a party official. But the prime minister’s speech was also clearly intended for a wider audience; he shared a clip on his official social media channels. The B.J.P. remains the favorite to win another parliamentary majority when six weeks of voting concludes on June 1 and ballots are counted three days later. Mr. Kharge, the Congress party president, called Mr. Modi’s speech — perhaps hopefully — a sign of desperation, adding that opposition candidates must be faring well in the early stages of balloting. Neerja Chowdhury, a columnist and the author of “How Prime Ministers Decide,” echoed Mr. Kharge, saying that, in her view, “voters are expressing their dissatisfaction much more openly this time.” The B.J.P. is capable of a swift course correction, she added, because “they get feedback very quickly.” Rahul Gandhi, the public face of the Congress party, said that Mr. Modi’s comments had been intended as a diversion from subjects that trouble ordinary voters, like joblessness and inflation. That the prime minister alluded to religion at all in his speech drew complaints that he may have violated India’s election rules. Candidates are supposed to be barred from asking for votes in the name of religion or caste. But B.J.P. leaders regularly invoke Hindu deities during campaign rallies. The country’s Election Commission, which enforces the rules, has taken little action against the party, even as it has moved against members of other parties in similar cases. Uddhav Thackeray, a former ally of Mr. Modi’s who is now running against the B.J.P., declared that he would now ignore an Election Commission order to remove the word “Hindu” from his own party’s campaign song. The basis for Mr. Modi’s attack was a 22-second excerpt from a statement that Mr. Singh, a Sikh economist who was the prime minister before Mr. Modi, made in 2006. Mr. Singh had been listing many of the traditionally disadvantaged groups in India, including lower-caste Hindus and tribal populations, and “in particular the Muslim community,” and said that all should share equitably in the nation’s wealth. Since Mr. Modi took office in 2014, Muslims haven’t had a proportional share of India’s steady economic and social development. Just one of the 430 candidates the B.J.P. is fielding in the current election is Muslim. Mr. Singh’s speech from 2006 seems old now, but it was made just four years after riots in the state of Gujarat under the watch of Mr. Modi.

nytimes,‘Discomfort May Increase’: Asia’s Heat Wave Scorches Hundreds of Millions,"April 22, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/world/asia/heatwave-india-bangladesh.html,"Hundreds of millions of people in South and Southeast Asia were suffering on Monday from a punishing heat wave that has forced schools to close, disrupted agriculture, and raised the risk of heat strokes and other health complications. The weather across the region in April is generally hot, and comes before Asia’s annual summer monsoon, which dumps rain on parched soil. But this April’s temperatures have so far been unusually high. In Bangladesh, where schools and universities are closed this week, temperatures in some areas have soared above 107 degrees Fahrenheit, or 42 degrees Celsius. Those numbers don’t quite capture how extreme humidity makes the heat feel even worse. “Due to increasing moisture incursion, the discomfort may increase” over the next 72 hours, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department said in a notice on Monday. In Dhaka, the capital, the humidity was 73 percent, and many areas in the country have experienced daily power outages. The heat wave could lead to more cases of certain diseases, including cholera and diarrhea, said Be-Nazir Ahmed, a public health expert in Bangladesh and a former director of the national Directorate General of Health Services. Mr. Ahmed said that people should ideally try to work earlier in the morning and later at night, when temperatures are lower. But that is easier said than done in a country where many people work outdoors. Nur-e-Alam, who pulls a rickshaw by hand in Dhaka’s Mogbazar area, said he had scaled back to five to seven hours a day, down from eight to 10, because of the heat. His earnings have taken a hit. He expected to make 500 to 600 takas, or about $5, on Monday, about half his usual wage. “I haven’t experienced heat like this before,” Mr. Alam said. “Every year gets hotter, but this year is extreme.” The heat wave poses similar challenges in neighboring India, where extreme temperatures have strained power grids, forced school closures, and threatened the production of wheat and other crops. Temperatures in some areas did not dip below 108 degrees Fahrenheit last weekend. The national meteorological department said on Sunday that it expected heat wave conditions in some states for another five days. The heat has collided with the start of India’s six-week general election, in which nearly a billion people are eligible to vote. The election authorities are working to provide water on voting days, and some political parties are bringing water and cooling devices to campaign rallies. Extreme heat also has a political dimension in Myanmar, where the ruling military junta cited soaring temperatures last week as justification for moving Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the country’s ousted civilian leader, from prison to an undisclosed location. Many people in Myanmar believe that generals are moving her for other reasons but using the heat — the capital recently hit 114.8 degrees Fahrenheit — as a pretext. Asia’s heat wave isn’t happening in a meteorological vacuum. Last year was Earth’s warmest by far in a century and a half. And the region is in the middle of an El Niño cycle, a climate phenomenon that tends to create warm, dry conditions in Asia. Asia’s summer monsoon will bring relief, but it’s still weeks away.

nytimes,India to Redo Voting at Polling Stations Hit by Violence,"April 21, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/21/world/asia/india-presidential-election-voting-manipur.html,"India’s election authorities have directed officials to redo voting at several polling places in the troubled northeastern state of Manipur, after armed men attacked polling stations and captured voting booths despite the presence of dozens of paramilitary soldiers. The state of Manipur has endured ethnic conflict for months after a dispute erupted over who gets to claim a tribal status that grants extra privileges, for example preferential treatment in seeking government jobs. The conflict, which began last May, has essentially split the region, home to about three million people, pitting two ethnic groups against each other: the mostly Hindu Meiteis, who form a narrow majority, and members of Christian hill tribes known as Kukis. More than 200 people have been killed, members of both groups. Thousands were internally displaced and still fear returning to places they once called home, seeking refuge in squalid camps. The Election Commission of India said on Saturday that voting would be done again on Monday in 11 polling stations where voting had been held on Friday. The order came after the region’s top election commissioner wrote to his agency describing mob violence, gunfire, damage to electronic voting machines and bogus voters entering the booths. Video footage from the Inner Manipur constituency, one of the two seats in the state for the lower house of Parliament, showed mobs raiding a polling station and breaking electronic voting machines. At another station, members of an armed gang were seen threatening voters. One women said that when she arrived to vote, she found that the votes of her entire family had already been cast. One person was also injured by gunfire. Tens of thousands of soldiers have been deployed to prevent violence in different parts of the country, as the voting continues till June 1 to elect the country’s next prime minister. Local residents in Manipur said that soldiers had tried to keep order but were overpowered by people, mostly women, who rushed into the voting booths, and intimidated by the presence of armed men. Members of opposition political groups say the problems were not confined to the 11 polling places that will get a do-over, and are calling for new voting in more than 45 polling booths in 12 areas of Manipur. Keisham Meghachandra, a top leader of the opposition Indian National Congress in Manipur, said that members of armed gangs supportive of the incumbent government had threatened candidates and voters the day before the elections and on the day of polling even fired at a polling station. “It was mass rigging,” Mr. Meghachandra said. “Violence happened in places where majority of voters are unhappy with both local and Modi government.” Manipur is run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party and led by Nongthombam Biren Singh. An adviser to Mr. Singh, the state’s chief minister, did not answer calls on Sunday. Across India, the first phase of voting took place on Friday in 102 parliamentary seats, but six phases still remain, with results to be announced on June 4.",india election authority directed official redo voting several polling place troubled northeastern state manipur armed men attacked polling station captured voting booth despite presence dozen paramilitary soldier state manipur endured ethnic conflict month dispute erupted get claim tribal status grant extra privilege example preferential treatment seeking government job conflict began last may essentially split region home three million people pitting two ethnic group mostly hindu meiteis form narrow majority member christian hill tribe known kuki people killed member group thousand internally displaced still fear returning place called home seeking refuge squalid camp election commission india said saturday voting would done monday polling station voting held friday order came region top election commissioner wrote agency describing mob violence gunfire damage electronic voting machine bogus voter entering booth video footage inner manipur constituency one two seat state lower house parliament showed mob raiding polling station breaking electronic voting machine another station member armed gang seen threatening voter one woman said arrived vote found vote entire family already cast one person also injured gunfire ten thousand soldier deployed prevent violence different part country voting continues till june elect country next prime minister local resident manipur said soldier tried keep order overpowered people mostly woman rushed voting booth intimidated presence armed men member opposition political group say problem confined polling place get doover calling new voting polling booth area manipur keisham meghachandra top leader opposition indian national congress manipur said member armed gang supportive incumbent government threatened candidate voter day election day polling even fired polling station mass rigging mr meghachandra said violence happened place majority voter unhappy local modi government manipur run prime minister narendra modis bharatiya janata party led nongthombam biren singh adviser mr singh state chief minister answer call sunday across india first phase voting took place friday parliamentary seat six phase still remain result announced june,-33.0,negative,2
nytimes,Time Is Running Out for Rahul Gandhi’s Vision for India,"April 20, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/magazine/rahul-gandhi-india-election-bjp.html,"Rahul Gandhi stood in a red Jeep, amid a churning crowd in Varanasi, trying to unseat the Indian government with a microphone in his hand. “The mic isn’t good,” he said. “Please quiet down and listen.” It was the morning of Feb. 17 — Day 35 of a journey that began in the hills of Manipur, in India’s northeast, and would end by the ocean in Mumbai, in mid-March. In total, Gandhi would cover 15 states and 4,100 miles, traveling across a country that once voted for his party, the Indian National Congress, almost by reflex. No longer, though. For a decade, the Congress Party has been so deep in the political wilderness, occupying fewer than a tenth of the seats in Parliament, that even its well-wishers wonder if Gandhi is merely the custodian of its end.  Gandhi called his expedition the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra — roughly, the Unite India March for Justice. He never said it in so many words, but the yatra was an appeal to voters to deny Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party a third straight term in parliamentary elections starting on April 19. Congress, the only other party with a national presence, is the fulcrum of an anti-B.J.P. coalition. Indian pundits and journalists bicker about many things, but on this point they’re unanimous: Only a miracle will halt the B.J.P. Still, it falls to Gandhi, steward of his enfeebled party, to try. The speech lasted barely 15 minutes. Gandhi is a fidgety orator, unable to shrug off the routine disturbances of a rally. He kept calling for silence, and scolding overzealous policemen regulating the mob. He didn’t ramble, exactly, but eddied around the point he wanted to make. “This is a country of love, not of hate,” he said. He talked of two Indias, populated respectively by the millionaires and the impoverished. He laid into TV news channels, many of which have been captured by oligarchs prospering under the B.J.P.: “They won’t show the farmers, or the workers or the poor,” he said. “But they will show Narendra Modi 24 hours a day.” Then he helped onto his Jeep a member of the audience, a young man who complained that, despite spending hundreds of thousands of rupees on his education, he still had no job. His is a common story in Modi’s India. Two out of every five recent college graduates are out of work, and young people make up 83 percent of the unemployed. To his crowd, Gandhi called out: “These are the two issues facing India: unemployment and — ?” He received only a tepid response of “poverty.” When he finished, there was no applause. The crush of people at the rally was suffocating, although in India a crowd is no index of popularity. People may gawk and then go vote for the other guy — and Gandhi is, after all, one of the country’s most recognizable men. Officially, he is no longer his party’s president, but he is undoubtedly its face. At 53, with a well-salted beard and serious eyes, he’s too old to be called Congress’s “scion,” but he still wears the sheen of dynasty. His great-grandfather, the unflinchingly secular Jawaharlal Nehru, was India’s first prime minister. His grandmother, Indira, and his father, Rajiv, both became prime ministers; both were assassinated. His mother, Sonia, steered Congress into government in 2004 and 2009, but declined the top post. Then, on the heels of several corruption scandals, the mighty party — 140 years old next year — came unstuck. Out of 543 seats in the lower house of Parliament, Congress holds just 46, compared to the B.J.P.’s 288. Gandhi embodies all this history: the triumphs as well as the failures. For the crowds, that is the fascination he exerts. One of Modi’s successes has been not just to trounce the Congress Party but also to persuade people that the party has weakened India and emasculated its Hindus. Through his cult of personality, Modi is fulfilling a century-old project, recasting India as a Hindu nation, in which minorities, particularly Muslims, live at the sufferance of the majority. Emblematic of this is a new law offering fast-tracked citizenship to people fleeing Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan — as long as they aren’t Muslim. It is the B.J.P.’s totemic achievement: the use of religion to decide who can be called “Indian.” Opposing this law or indeed resisting the B.J.P. in any way has proved difficult. Investigating agencies mount flimsy cases against critics of the government, as Amnesty International has frequently noted. (Amnesty itself halted its work in India in 2020, in the midst of what it later called an “incessant witch hunt” by the government.) Activists are regularly imprisoned, sometimes on the basis of planted evidence; journalists are sent to jail or otherwise bullied so frequently that India has slipped to 161st out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index, just three spots above Russia. Pliant courts often endorse it all. Such is the mood in India that one of the plainest sentences in Congress’s election manifesto is also one of its most resonant: “We promise you freedom from fear.” As the election neared, the quelling of dissent grew more visible still. This year, in an unprecedented move, Modi’s administration arrested two chief ministers of states run by small opposition parties. (One stepped down hours before his arrest.) In both instances, the government claimed corruption, but many critics noted that the arrests were uncannily timed to pull two popular politicians out of campaign season in states where the B.J.P. has struggled. Income-tax authorities froze Congress’s bank accounts, supposedly over a late filing. “It has been orchestrated to cripple us in the elections,” Gandhi told reporters. If so, it feels like overkill, because it is common wisdom that Congress can’t win. Those who want nothing to do with the B.J.P. watch Gandhi with conflicted anguish. He is, by all accounts, sincere, empathetic and committed to a pluralistic India. This is a man who forgave his father’s killers, and who said on the sidelines of a private New York event last year, according to one of those present: “I don’t hate Modi. The day I hate, I will leave politics.” But he’s also the latest in a lineage under whom Congress grew undemocratic and sometimes wildly corrupt. The great liberal hope is that Gandhi can achieve contradictory things: use his dynastic privilege to resuscitate his party, and dissolve the dynasty at the same time. That’s a steep demand, but Gandhi’s priorities are altogether more Himalayan. “He doesn’t say it,” Sitaram Yechury, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) who knows Gandhi well, told me, “but he’s modeling himself after Mahatma Gandhi. He doesn’t want to take any position of power.” In January, Gandhi told his colleagues that he has “one foot in and one foot out of the party,” and that he plans to be “a bridge to activists outside.” As he explained it then, the B.J.P., with its undiluted majoritarianism, “is a political-ideological machine. It can’t be defeated by a political machine alone.” His role, as he sees it, is to be the counter ideology — to go out into the country, rouse Indians to the dangers of the B.J.P. and offer them his dream of a fairer, more tolerant India instead. The yatra is a well-worn exercise in Indian politics. Its most famous practitioner, Mahatma Gandhi, returned from South Africa in 1915 hungering to know more about his country. Go travel the land, one of his mentors told him, “with eyes and ears open, but mouth shut.” After using the yatra to gain an education, he employed it for political purpose. In 1930, he walked 240 miles to the Arabian Sea to protest the British monopoly on salt; hundreds of people joined him, and he spoke to thousands en route. On reaching the beach, he scooped out a fist of salty sand and announced he had broken the monopoly, setting off a wave of civil disobedience. There have been plenty of other yatras since. In 1983, Smita Gupta, a retired journalist who was then a cub reporter, walked part of a 2,650-mile yatra by a politician named Chandra Shekhar, as he tried to enlist support against Indira Gandhi. As Gupta recalled, for people who live far from the centers of power, “when a politician descends from the skies and comes to your home, it’s a big deal — I was swept away.” Rahul Gandhi conceived of his yatra much as Chandra Shekhar did: as a way to counter the ideology of a seemingly immovable leader. There’s no place more vital for this project than Uttar Pradesh, the state through which I trailed him in February. With its 80 parliamentary seats and 240 million people, many living on incomes lower than the sub-Saharan average of $1,700 a year, Uttar Pradesh is electorally pivotal. Excelling here isn’t a guarantee of securing power in Delhi, but it’s as close to ironclad as it gets. It’s also the state that produced the Gandhis. When Nehru, born in Uttar Pradesh, ran for Parliament from a constituency near his hometown, Congress shared one advantage with other parties in post-colonial countries: the glory of having led the freedom struggle. That kept for surprisingly long without spoiling. Nehru’s heirs — Indira, then her son Rajiv, then his wife, Sonia — all won election after election from their constituencies in Uttar Pradesh. Rahul Gandhi once called Uttar Pradesh his karmabhoomi, a Sanskrit word for the land of one’s momentous actions. But Uttar Pradesh also became the land where Congress was fated to fail. Today it’s the roiling heart of the B.J.P.’s Hindu nationalism. Varanasi, Hinduism’s most sacred city, lies near the state’s eastern border, and Modi chose to represent it in Parliament — a crafty choice for a man wishing to be hailed as a defender of his faith. Around 40 million Muslims live in the state, and under its B.J.P. chief minister, they’re increasingly being erased from public life. One law jeopardizes their right to marry whom they wish. Other regulations have constricted the meat trade, in which many Muslims work. Islamic schools are in danger of being banned outright. By painting Muslims as trespassers, the B.J.P. licenses violence against them, sometimes even explicitly. (In 2015, a man was beaten to death by his Hindu neighbors in his village in western Uttar Pradesh, on the rumor that he had slaughtered a cow. The men accused of his murder have since been freed on bail and the case is still unresolved.) More than any other part of India, Uttar Pradesh shows what the B.J.P. has wrought and how successful it has been. In 2019, during the last national election, the B.J.P. swept 62 of the state’s 80 seats. Congress won just one. A few years ago, Gandhi decided that his party needed a way to mobilize people against the B.J.P., settling on a yatra as a means to that end. He embarked on his first, walking up the spine of India, in late 2022. Even the plainness of his attire — sneakers, loosefitting trousers, white polo shirt — was a rebuke to the Olympian vanity of Modi, who once had his own name stitched, in tiny letters, to form the pinstripes of a suit. The yatras felt like campaigns, yet Gandhi’s team insists that they were not about projecting him as prime minister but rather a form of ideological resistance, almost above politics. (His staff politely refused my repeated requests for an interview.) The Congress Party found itself divided over Gandhi’s approach. Salman Khurshid, a Congress veteran, worried that the party has strayed from bread-and-butter political strategy. We were in his office in Delhi, and he kept looking dolorously at his phone, which never stopped ringing. It was the feverish middle of the election season, and Congress was picking its candidates and negotiating alliances with other parties. Gandhi had to weigh in, Khurshid said: “We’d like him to be within shouting distance. He’s a thousand kilometers away.” Khurshid wished for a more customary system, the sort that promised, say, a 20-minute appointment at 10 a.m. to talk about three things. “That’s how ordinary political parties work,” he said. “He wants an extraordinary political party.” Sometimes, Gandhi’s team told Khurshid and others to come on the yatra and talk to Gandhi on the bus. But it wasn’t sufficient, Khurshid told me. “There’s never enough time.” The yatra involved a lot of stopping and starting and stopping again, as I discovered. Two or three times a day, Gandhi’s Jeep — and its caravan of police cars, S.U.V.s and a vehicle bearing a device labeled “Jammer” — inched through a town, halting at a crossroads for a speech. Then the convoy would hasten to its next engagement, trying to cover vast Uttar Pradesh distances through dense Uttar Pradesh traffic, and always behind schedule. The day ended in a cordoned-off campsite, where everyone slept in shipping containers fitted with bunks. Here, in his own enclosure, Gandhi hobnobbed with local Congress functionaries or practiced jiu-jitsu with his instructor. In Prayagraj, where we headed after Varanasi, it’s possible to traverse the distance between the party’s zenith and its rock bottom in a single evening. First, Gandhi made a speech outside Anand Bhavan, an ancestral family home, an eggshell-white mansion on an emerald lawn. Anand Bhavan is now a museum, but its chief relic is intangible: the promise of Nehruvian secularism, circa 1947. Then, while leaving Prayagraj, we passed the high court that invalidated Indira Gandhi’s election in 1975 on the grounds of electoral malpractice. The verdict provoked her to impose a state of emergency — a suspension of civic rights — for nearly two years, tarnishing Congress and strengthening its competitors. By this time too, the party had wrapped itself feudally around the dynasty. Any emergent leaders with their own base were subdued or cast off because they threatened the Gandhis. By the late 1980s, other politicians had clawed voters away from Congress by courting specific groups — members of a caste, say, or as with the B.J.P. and Hindus, of a religion. As Congress faltered, its workers joined rival parties, including the B.J.P. In India, party workers don’t just canvass voters — they step in for an insufficient state. If a farmer needing a loan is turned away by the bank manager, or if a woman can’t pay the cost of treatment for her sick daughter, party workers use their contacts to help. These services are performed in the hope that the favors will be returned every five years, come the election. “The average party worker needs, say, 10,000 rupees a month to run his home,” an old Congress hand in Varanasi, who asked not to be named for fear of professional reprisal, told me. “If their party can’t get to power, how will they get paid? They’ll go work for whoever is most likely to win.” Gilles Verniers, a political scientist, recounted taking his Ashoka University class on a trip to Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh’s capital, on the day votes were counted in a state election in 2017. He distributed his pupils among the headquarters of various parties, but by midmorning, the students at the Congress office called him. “They said: ‘Can we go elsewhere?’” Verniers told me. “ ‘There’s no one here, everybody left.’ The party knew they were getting spanked, but at least you could stick around, thanking workers, encouraging them. There was no one to even make tea.” Today, the Varanasi representative told me, “we just hope to God we win even one seat in Uttar Pradesh.” Gandhi entered politics with several lifetimes’ worth of trauma packed into his 33 years. When he was 14, two of his grandmother’s bodyguards shot her dead — revenge for an assault she ordered upon a Sikh temple to root out separatist militants sheltering within. The bodyguards had taught a young Rahul how to play badminton. Seven years later, while he was a student at Harvard, his father, Rajiv, was killed by a suicide bomber — revenge again, this time by a separatist group in Sri Lanka, where he had sent Indian troops to aid the government. It became difficult for Rahul Gandhi to be Rahul Gandhi: to trust people or go anywhere ungirded by security. For a while it didn’t seem inevitable that he would choose politics. Later he would say that he made the decision on a train just as it entered Prayagraj, when he was taking his father’s cremated remains to pour into the Ganges River. Smita Gupta, the former journalist, attended one of Gandhi’s earliest rallies, in an Uttar Pradesh town called Farrukhabad, in 2004. The road was so crowded that a 15-minute drive took three hours. Gandhi arrived in a Jeep, smiling and dimpling and waving. As he walked to the dais, the barricades broke from the masses of excited people pushing against them. “He was swept away, sailing with the crowd,” Gupta said. Soon after Congress won that election, Gandhi took charge of the party’s junior wing. The transition to the dynasty’s next generation seemed underway, and he exhibited the air of someone who knew he was the man for the job. At the time, Gandhi often showed little patience with the orthodox figures of politics. Pratap Bhanu Mehta, a political scientist at Princeton, who met Gandhi back then, recalled that he made minimal eye contact and seemed distracted — unable even to feign interest as politicians usually do so well. A journalist who met Gandhi privately told me that he was, as the saying goes, eager to tell you what you thought: “It was: ‘You don’t know how the Congress works. Let me tell you.’ Or, ‘I’ll tell you about India and Pakistan.’” In his memoir “A Promised Land,” Barack Obama compared Gandhi, whom he met in 2010, to “a student who’d done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject.” One of Gandhi’s colleagues admits he used to be “very anxious and pushy” back in the day. “He has calmed down over a period of time.” He had to. Congress isn’t a party you can change in a hurry. Its ways are too ossified, and it is honeycombed with fiefs. When Gandhi wanted Congress to field new faces in elections, he pushed for candidates to be selected through an internal voting system, rather like a primary. According to one former party consultant, senior politicians, worried about losing their tickets, complained to his mother, Sonia, the Congress president. Khurshid, one of the old guard, told me: “Everything that destroys democracy got in there — money, muscle, power.” It resulted in “the dedicated warriors of the Congress at the youth level” being sidelined. The primaries never took off. In 2018, Gandhi wanted young chief ministers in three states where Congress had won state elections. He didn’t get his way. But at least Gandhi tried something, a consultant to Congress told me. “If you leave it to these other guys,” he said, “they will not even change the curtains in the party office.” These exasperations may have amplified a hesitancy about power and responsibility that Gandhi seemed always to harbor. In 2009, he declined the offer to be a cabinet minister. Perhaps even then he saw his role as that of a moral authority outside the government, Yechury said. On becoming the party’s vice president, Gandhi gave not a stirring speech but a somber one, recalling the assassinations in his family and counseling his party that “power is poison.” In 2017, he became the party’s president, but after Congress lost the 2019 election, he quit the post. According to two Congress sources, he expected other top party leaders to feel accountable and step down as well. No one did. In a party often pilloried for being dynastic, Gandhi has been unable to stamp his will on Congress. One friend of the family described Gandhi as “timid.” When his 2022 yatra went through the state of Kerala, Yechury, the Communist leader, considered walking with him, but members of Congress’s Kerala unit protested: The Communists were their chief rivals in the state, and this show of solidarity — even against the B.J.P., a common antagonist — wouldn’t do at all. Yechury couldn’t understand it. Gandhi might not be the party’s president, but there’s no doubt he is its presiding force, Yechury said. Why didn’t he just hold fast? Two years ago, during a protest in Delhi, Gandhi and dozens of his Congress colleagues were detained by the police. One of those present, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly, told me that several senior leaders were held together, and Gandhi had “really frank and open conversations” with them. A couple of these leaders “got aggressive, saying, ‘You have to take charge,’ persuading him to take back the party presidency, accusing him of running away from responsibility.” It was high-octane drama: “What do you do when you’re detained, man? We were there for six hours. He couldn’t go anywhere.” The Congress worker remembers Gandhi saying then: “I know what I have to do. My job is to do mass outreach. You guys handle the party.” Gandhi’s two yatras have unfolded in the shadow of another, some 30 years ago — one that ultimately helped bring Modi to power. Riding in a Toyota decked out as a chariot, a B.J.P. leader named Lal Krishna Advani rode through northern and central India, advertising one of his party’s priorities: the claim that, 450 years earlier in the town Ayodhya, a Mughal ruler had knocked down a temple to build a mosque. Advani promised his audiences that the B.J.P. would restore the temple to that very spot. Two years later, the foot soldiers of the B.J.P. and other right-wing groups razed the mosque, triggering not just riots that killed 2,000 people but also a deep fracture in Indian society. After that, the B.J.P. regularly listed the construction of a temple in its election manifestos, harvesting votes out of the religious polarization around the issue. In 2019, mere months after Modi won his second term, the Supreme Court ruled that the mosque’s demolition was illegal, and that there was no evidence it had been built by knocking down a Hindu shrine. Yet the judges allowed a new temple to be erected on the site, legitimizing the majority’s abuse of disputed medieval history to its own retributive ends. In January, that temple was consecrated. Modi presided over the rites, as if he were head priest rather than prime minister. Congress didn’t send any representatives to the temple’s inauguration, and I had expected Gandhi to speak about Ayodhya, which lies, after all, in Uttar Pradesh. But he barely mentioned it, even in Varanasi, a city facing a potential reprise of Ayodhya. The morning after his speech there, I visited a quarter called Pilikothi, following a sequence of lanes, each framed by so many tall tenements that there was something canyonlike about them. It was a Sunday, but Pilikothi echoed with the tack-tack of sari looms. The sound drifted into the basement in which Abdul Batin Nomani, the mufti of Varanasi, sat at a low desk. Behind him were shelves of theological volumes. When he pulled a book out to illustrate a point, his hand didn’t hesitate for a second. The title of mufti, or jurist, has been in Nomani’s family since 1927, and he has filled the role for more than two decades. In that time, he said, the B.J.P. has spread so much hate that it has corroded even the possibility of amicable relations between Hindus and Muslims. You can be arrested for offering the namaz in public, or for being a Muslim man marrying a Hindu woman, or for running your butcher shop during Hindu festivals. You could be lynched on a whisper that you’re carrying beef, or have your house bulldozed on suspicion of being a rioter, or be hunted by mobs goaded by B.J.P. politicians calling for murder. Nomani told me about the head of a Hindu monastery nearby, and how they would invite one another to their religious functions. “Then, slowly, his mind turned,” Nomani said. “He must have been convinced that to talk to people like me is wrong.” Nomani heads the committee of the Gyanvapi Mosque, another centuries-old structure that the Hindu right aims to replace with a temple. Weeks before I met Nomani, a court allowed Hindus to worship in the mosque’s basement, similar to what happened in Ayodhya in 1986. Varanasi’s Muslims are fearful, Nomani said. Wouldn’t the same cascade of consequences ensue? Wouldn’t other mosques surely follow? When the yatra swung by, Nomani told a local Congress representative he would welcome a meeting with Gandhi. It never transpired. Nomani wondered why Gandhi didn’t even speak about the issue and directly confront the B.J.P.’s divisive politics. “Someone could have called and reassured us: ‘Don’t worry, we’re with you,’” Nomani said. He regards Gandhi with sympathy. “I believe he wants to do the right thing, and that he is against this culture of hate,” he said. “But he’s weak. His party is weak. He can’t do anything.” From Prayagraj, the yatra headed to Amethi, a town a couple of hours to the north. I had last visited in 2009, when it was still a stronghold of Congress’s first family, and I remembered the fields of winter mustard, yellow till the horizon, on the town’s outskirts and the wishbone layout of its three main roads. Gandhi won resoundingly that year. But in 2014, when his margin shrank, he must have seen the incoming tide of Hindu nationalism. Sanjay Singh, a local Congress worker, recalled that, on vote-counting day, Gandhi sounded dispirited as the results trickled in, telling his colleagues “the politics of this state is beyond my understanding.” In 2019, the B.J.P. flipped Amethi. If Gandhi hadn’t simultaneously run from another seat, in Kerala, he wouldn’t be in Parliament at all. The yatra’s schedule included an evening rally, so I spent the afternoon in Singh’s house in a village nearby. A stern-eyed man with a ramrod bearing, he wore a spotless white shirt and trousers, and he had tucked a Congress streamer around his neck like a cravat. He lamented Congress’s loss of Amethi, but he wasn’t surprised. Between 2014 and 2019, Gandhi visited Amethi less and less, dispatching his advisers instead. Still, Singh felt almost guilty that Amethi voted for the B.J.P. Last year he had a chance to meet Gandhi, he said, and asked him to run from Amethi again: “I told him, ‘Whatever mistake we made, we’re ready to rectify.’” A few weeks after I met Singh, though, Gandhi declared that he would stick to his constituency in Kerala. For the rally, the party had set up rows of chairs in a field, but the audience started dribbling out almost as soon as it began. By the time Gandhi was midway through his speech, only half the chairs were occupied. He talked about China, and riots in faraway Manipur, and the B.J.P.’s cronyism. Standing next to me, a policewoman told a videographer, “He isn’t talking about Amethi at all.” The only cheers came when he raised the plight of India’s poorer castes — the very people who made up most of his audience. As he had done throughout the yatra, he warned them they’d never get very far in the B.J.P.’s India. He may well be right, but I remembered something Mehta told me. Modi’s narrative of a resurgent Hinduism, however hollow, makes people feel good about themselves, Mehta said. “Rahul’s narrative does the opposite.” The next day, something interrupted the yatra’s staid choreography. We were in Raebareli, the one Uttar Pradesh constituency still with the Congress Party. Halfway through his address, Gandhi invited a young man onto his Jeep to quiz him about his prospects. The man introduced himself as Amit Maurya, but he was barely audible, so Gandhi said, paternally but lightly, “First, learn how to handle a microphone.” “I’m a little anxious, sir.” “Don’t worry,” Gandhi replied. “You’re a lion.” Either it was the pressure of the moment or the unchecking of a dam of frustration, but Maurya burst into tears. In the week’s most genuine moment, Gandhi seemed nonplused, as if he didn’t know what to do with this political gift. Instinctively, he folded Maurya into an embrace and kept his arm around the sobbing man. Still, he just couldn’t abandon his routine — the statistics he’d memorized, the thesis presentation mode he was in. But even if his speech didn’t change, he sounded more passionate — angry, even — about the inequities he had lined up to narrate to his crowd. Well after the yatra’s end, when summer hammers down and ballot machines appear in schools and colleges and municipal buildings, Gandhi may at least be able to count on Maurya’s vote. But who knows. Elections are subject to every manner of caprice, and the B.J.P. has shown itself to be peerless at swaying India’s voters. Out of hubris or audacity, Gandhi wants to persuade people to consider lofty things like morality and love, indispensable values that nonetheless make for nebulous campaign platforms. He doesn’t mind if it takes years, and perhaps he doesn’t mind if he loses his party in the process. In that time, though, he risks seeing his idea of India extinguished altogether.",rahul gandhi stood red jeep amid churning crowd varanasi trying unseat indian government microphone hand mic isnt good

nytimes,Why India’s Opposition Can’t Get It Together,"April 19, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/world/asia/india-election-opposition.html,"The last time Indians voted in a national election, in 2019, the Bharatiya Janata Party, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, won running away. But even then, more than 60 percent of voters cast ballots for other parties. That Mr. Modi has established such dominance in Parliament despite falling well short of majority popular support is a reflection of a dysfunctional and fractured political opposition. The main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, governed for decades after the country’s independence in 1947, guided by the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. The party’s standing is now much reduced: In 2019, it won 52 seats in Parliament to the B.J.P.’s 303. It is not expected to do much better in this year’s election, which began on Friday and runs for six weeks. Here’s why India’s political opposition is in such dire straits. The Congress, long positioned at India’s political center, has struggled to find a direction and offer an ideological alternative to the Hindu nationalist B.J.P. That has held back the broader opposition’s fight against Mr. Modi. The Congress has faced a leadership crisis, a series of rebellions and bouts of infighting. Even after two consecutive losses to Mr. Modi, the party has stuck to its dynastic leadership. It has again put forward Rahul Gandhi, the son, grandson and great-grandson of Indian prime ministers, as its face in taking on Mr. Modi. Mr. Gandhi has tried to increase his political weight by leading long marches across the country, including one of more than 2,000 miles. But when he has seemed to find momentum, the B.J.P. has moved to check it. After his first march, which drew large crowds, the B.J.P. ensnared him in a court case that led to his expulsion from Parliament. He was later returned to his seat by India’s highest court. His party’s losses in a couple of important state elections in recent months also threw it off course, laying bare the extent of its deeply entrenched problems. In the months before the election, a range of opposition parties formed an alliance catchily named INDIA, short for the less mellifluous Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance. The coalition’s creation caused unease among B.J.P. leaders, suggesting that the election could be a less one-sided affair. But a series of bitter disagreements over the sharing of seats among alliance members has disappointed many supporters. In some states, parties in the coalition failed to iron out longstanding differences, putting the protection of local turf over the national ambition of challenging Mr. Modi. One state’s chief minister, who was a founder and prominent face of the opposition bloc, even switched sides to join the B.J.P. Mr. Modi has been relentless in trying to split the coalition, luring some members with incentives and bogging down others with investigations and jail sentences. Opposition groups say Mr. Modi is having government agencies do his political work for him. They seem to have a point: Opposition leaders have been the target of about 90 percent of the cases involving politicians pursued by the country’s top financial crimes agency since Mr. Modi took power in 2014. Weeks before this year’s election, tax agencies under Mr. Modi moved to freeze the Congress’s bank accounts, leaving the party paralyzed. The Modi government has also sent two chief ministers from opposition parties to jail. While the Congress has long been the subject of Mr. Modi’s wrath — he has even declared that he wants a “Congress-free India” — a smaller outfit, the Aam Aadmi Party, or A.A.P., has faced a particularly harsh crackdown. Mr. Modi, analysts say, sees the A.A.P. as a potential national challenger as the Congress fades. The party runs the governments in the Delhi capital region and in the state of Punjab, and has made inroads in Mr. Modi’s home state of Gujarat. The opposition coalition has gone after Mr. Modi largely on two issues: the increasing authoritarianism it says is turning India’s democracy into one-party rule, and political corruption it contends is enriching a small elite. Opposition leaders have also pointed to growing inequality and India’s huge shortfall in jobs, particularly for its massive population of young people. It’s unclear whether these lines of attack have done much to dent Mr. Modi’s standing. He has amassed great power and popularity through a potent mix of Hindu majoritarianism, robust welfare programs and his own personal charisma. Mr. Modi also has enormous control over India’s channels of information, with the broadcast media particularly bent to his wishes.",last time indian voted national election bharatiya janata party led prime minister narendra modi running away even percent voter cast ballot party mr modi established dominance parliament despite falling well short majority popular support reflection dysfunctional fractured political opposition main opposition party indian national congress governed decade country independence guided nehrugandhi dynasty party standing much reduced seat parliament bjps expected much better year election began friday run six week here india political opposition dire strait congress long positioned india political center struggled find direction offer ideological alternative hindu nationalist bjp held back broader opposition fight mr modi congress faced leadership crisis series rebellion bout infighting even two consecutive loss mr modi party stuck dynastic leadership put forward rahul gandhi son grandson greatgrandson indian prime minister face taking mr modi mr gandhi tried increase political weight leading long march across country including one mile seemed find momentum bjp moved check first march drew large crowd bjp ensnared court case led expulsion parliament later returned seat india highest court party loss couple important state election recent month also threw course laying bare extent deeply entrenched problem month election range opposition party formed alliance catchily named india short le mellifluous indian national developmental inclusive alliance coalition creation caused unease among bjp leader suggesting election could le onesided affair series bitter disagreement sharing seat among alliance member disappointed many supporter state party coalition failed iron longstanding difference putting protection local turf national ambition challenging mr modi one state chief minister founder prominent face opposition bloc even switched side join bjp mr modi relentless trying split coalition luring member incentive bogging others investigation jail sentence opposition group say mr modi government agency political work seem point opposition leader target percent case involving politician pursued country top financial crime agency since mr modi took power week year election tax agency mr modi moved freeze congress bank account leaving party paralyzed modi government also sent two chief minister opposition party jail congress long subject mr modis wrath even declared want congressfree india smaller outfit aam aadmi party aap faced particularly harsh crackdown mr modi analyst say see aap potential national challenger congress fade party run government delhi capital region state punjab made inroad mr modis home state gujarat opposition coalition gone mr modi largely two issue increasing authoritarianism say turning india democracy oneparty rule political corruption contends enriching small elite opposition leader also pointed growing inequality india huge shortfall job particularly massive population young people unclear whether line attack done much dent mr modis standing amassed great power popularity potent mix hindu majoritarianism robust welfare program personal charisma mr modi also enormous control india channel information broadcast medium particularly bent wish,-11.0,negative,0
nytimes,"Modi’s Power Keeps Growing, and India Looks Sure to Give Him More","April 19, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/world/asia/modi-india-election.html,"As he campaigns across India for an election that began on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks of his insatiable ambitions in terms of dinner-table appetite. Roofs over heads, water connections, cooking gas cylinders — Mr. Modi reads down the menu of what he calls the abundant “development” he has provided to India’s poor. But he’s not stopping there. “What Modi has done so far is just the appetizer,” he said at one stop, referring to himself in the third person, as he often does. “The main course is yet to come.” To Mr. Modi’s legions of supporters, a third term would bring more of what they find so appealing in him. He is that rare breed of strongman who keeps an ear to the ground. He is a magnetic figure and a powerful orator. He has built an image as a tireless, incorruptible worker for a country on the rise. But to his critics, Mr. Modi’s talk of a “main course” is an alarm bell for the future of the world’s largest democracy. Mr. Modi, 73, enters the election a heavy favorite, his party’s grip over India’s more populous northern and central heartlands firmer than ever, the opposition in the same decisive geography even more diminished. Yet even with his place as India’s unrivaled leader seemingly secured, he has carried out a crackdown on dissent that has only intensified. In the lead-up to the voting, which will run for six weeks before results are announced on June 4, agencies under Mr. Modi’s control have frozen the bank accounts of the largest opposition party. The leaders of two opposition-run states have been thrown in jail, in cases they call politically motivated. (The capital region, New Delhi, is currently governed by a chief minister who sends his directives from behind bars.) All of this, Mr. Modi’s critics say, shows the penchant for full control that has become evident over his decade as prime minister. Mr. Modi, they contend, will not stop until he has turned India’s democracy into one-party rule. Power is being aggressively consolidated “around the cult of the leader’s personality,” said Yamini Aiyar, a policy analyst in New Delhi. “The deep centralization of power has significantly undermined institutional checks and balances baked into India’s democratic structure,” Ms. Aiyar said. Many Indians seem willing to accept this. Mr. Modi has remained deeply popular even as he has become more autocratic. He has paid little price — and even found support — for his effort to remake India into what analysts have called an illiberal democracy. He exploits contradictions. The right to vote is held as sacred in a country whose democracy has offered protection in a turbulent region. But polling also indicates that large numbers of Indians are willing to cede civil liberties to support a powerful ruler they see as getting things done. Another seeming incongruity: People who speak of their own economic strife also often express faith in Mr. Modi’s running of the country’s affairs, a testament to the forceful narratives he weaves. Indians have more tangible reasons to back him, too. Mr. Modi relentlessly tends his broad support base through generous offerings across society: favorable deals for the business elite in a growing economy, robust welfare programs for India’s impoverished majority, and a strong dose of Hindu nationalism for those in between. A campaign stop this month in his party’s stronghold of Uttar Pradesh illustrated this winning formula. Mr. Modi stood in the back of a saffron-colored truck as it moved slowly down a shopping street lined with global brands and jewelry shops, a scene that spoke to the new wealth that has lifted millions of Indians into the middle class. Overhead, billboards with pictures of Mr. Modi — his face is everywhere in India — told of achievements like the installation of more than 100 million toilets for the poor and India’s rising stature. At the end of the “roadshow,” at the junction where Mr. Modi’s vehicle turned right and headed back to Delhi, was a stage set up with loudspeakers. As Hindu nationalist songs blared, actors dressed up as the deities Ram and Sita posed for selfies with the crowd. Mr. Modi’s inauguration in January of a huge temple dedicated to Ram, on the disputed site of a mosque razed three decades ago by a Hindu mob, has been a major election-year offering to his Hindu base. “We are Hindu, we are Hindu, we will only speak of Ram,” went one song’s chant. “Those who brought Ram, we will bring them to power.” Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., started in 1980 as an urban middle-class organization centered around a Hindu majoritarian core. Under Mr. Modi, it has recast itself as the party of the poor and of the village in northern India, analysts say. Some in India believe that poorer people have merely fallen under Mr. Modi’s spell. Nalin Mehta, the author of the book “The New B.J.P.,” called that fundamentally wrong. “The fact that the B.J.P. continues to win these victories reflects how successful it has been in getting newer constituents of voters who never voted B.J.P. before, and who may not even be followers of Hindu nationalism,” he said. Mr. Mehta attributes much of that success to the party’s expansion and branding of welfare programs and its efforts to promote itself as pan-Hindu, actively reaching out to India’s marginalized castes. By prioritizing direct digital welfare payments, the B.J.P. has cut out the middleman and made sure the handouts are seen as coming straight from Mr. Modi. Technology also allows the party to follow up, with B.J.P. workers — armed with data — knocking on the door of anyone who received a water tap, a gas cylinder or a government grant to build a home. Data creates layers of feedback that help the party pick its candidates, jettisoning large numbers of incumbents before each election. “This B.J.P. is very ruthless on winnability,” Mr. Mehta said. Bringing it all together are Mr. Modi’s outsize appeal and his political and technological acumen. He has put his personal story at the center of his narrative of an ascendant India, the main pillar of his campaign. If a lower-caste son of a chai seller can become one of the most powerful men in the world, he says, other ordinary Indians can dream, too. While inequality has grown and 800 million Indians are at the mercy of monthly rations, many focus instead on their faith that Mr. Modi is not a thief. He casts himself as a bachelor with no descendants who works only for the Indian people, unlike what he calls the corrupt political dynasts in the opposition. “Modi wasn’t born in some royal family to become prime minister,” he told a crowd of tens of thousands in the state of Maharashtra. “It’s you who have brought him this far.” The political opposition has been severely weakened by infighting, leadership crises and its struggle to offer an ideological alternative to the B.J.P. But it also faces a playing field that Mr. Modi has tilted in his own favor. He has cowed the broadcast media. Independent journalists who do question his policies have been jailed or subjected to legal harassment. India leads the world in internet shutdowns, obscuring unrest that looks bad for the government. And officials under Mr. Modi have forced social media platforms to scrape critical content. Investigating agencies have been set loose on Mr. Modi’s political opponents — more than 90 percent of cases involving politicians over the past decade have involved the opposition. Many languish in jail or the court system. Those who switch allegiance to the B.J.P. find that their cases vanish. On the campaign trail in the state of West Bengal, an opposition candidate, Mahua Moitra, spoke of saving democracy from the authoritarianism she said had led to her own expulsion from Parliament — in a messy case involving a former romantic partner, a Rottweiler named Henry and accusations of graft. Autocracy and Mr. Modi’s perceived coziness with billionaires have been the opposition’s two main attack lines. While campaigning, Ms. Moitra told a group of women that they were still waiting for government money to build homes because Mr. Modi “is busy building palaces for his friends.” Analysts doubt that either issue will resonate widely. Many Indians, particularly in his stronghold in the north, which has a decisive say in who rules from New Delhi, like exactly what they are getting from Mr. Modi. “He is the prime minister, and if he is not strong enough, then what good would it be?” Anjali Vishwakarma, 37, an interior designer, said as she walked along the Ganges one recent day with her family in Mr. Modi’s constituency of Varanasi.",campaign across india election began friday prime minister narendra modi speaks insatiable ambition term dinnertable appetite roof head water connection cooking gas cylinder mr modi read

nytimes,Modi’s Temple of Lies,"April 18, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/opinion/india-election-modi-religion.html,"The sleepy pilgrimage city of Ayodhya in northern India was once home to a grand 16th-century mosque, until it was illegally demolished by a howling mob of Hindu militants in 1992. The site has since been reinvented as the centerpiece of the Hindu-chauvinist “new India” promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In 2020, as Covid-19 raged unchecked across the country, Mr. Modi, the leader of the Hindu right, went to Ayodhya to inaugurate construction of a three-story sandstone temple to the Hindu god Ram on the site of the former mosque. Dressed in shiny, flowing clothes and wearing a white N95 mask, he offered prayers to the Ram idol and the 88-pound silver brick being inserted as the foundation stone. I traveled to Ayodhya a year later and watched as the temple was hurriedly being built. But it seemed to me to offer not the promise of a new India so much as the seeds of its downfall. Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalism has fed distrust and hostility toward anything foreign, and the receptionists at my hotel were sullenly suspicious of outsiders. There was no hotel bar — a sign of Hindu virtue — and the food served was pure vegetarian, a phrase implying both Hindu caste purity and anti-Muslim prejudice. Outside, devotional music blared on loudspeakers while bony, manure-smeared cows, protected by Hindu law, wandered waterlogged streets in the rain. The souvenir shops at the temple displayed a toxic Hindu masculinity, highlighted by garish shirts featuring images of a steroid-fed Ram, all bulging muscles and chiseled six-packs. Even Hanuman, Ram’s wise but slightly mischievous monkey companion, appeared largely in the snarling Modi-era version known as Angry Hanuman, which went viral in 2018 after Mr. Modi praised the design. After a decade of rule by Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, Hindu-majority India maintains the facade of a democracy and has so far avoided the overt features of a theocracy. Yet, as Ayodhya revealed, it has, for all practical purposes, become a Hindu state. Adherence to this idea is demanded from everyone, whether Hindu or not. This is not sustainable, even if it seems likely that Mr. Modi will ride to a third victory in national parliamentary elections that begin Friday and conclude June 1. Mr. Modi’s India is marked by rampant inequality, lack of job prospects, abysmal public health and the increasing ravages of climate change. These crises cannot be addressed by turning one of the world’s most diverse countries into a claustrophobic Hindu nation. Perhaps even the prime minister and his party can sense this. Their crackdowns on opposition political leaders, manipulation of electoral rolls and voting machines and freezing of campaign funds for opposition parties are not the actions of a confident group. In January of this year, a wave of Hindu euphoria swept the nation as the temple I had watched being put together with cement and lies (there is no conclusive evidence supporting Hindu claims that Ram was a historical figure or that a temple to him previously stood there) was about to be inaugurated. Newspapers devoted rapturous front pages to the coming occasion, and when I flew to my former home Kolkata on the eve of the big day, my neighbors there declared their anticipation by setting off firecrackers late into the night. The next morning, on Jan. 22, loudspeakers and television screens tracked me through the city with Sanskrit chants and images of the ceremony taking place at the temple. Mr. Modi, as usual, was at the center of every visual. Friends in Delhi and Bangalore complained about insistent neighbors and strangers knocking on their doors to share celebratory sweets. Courts, banks, schools, stock markets and other establishments in much of the country took a holiday. The inauguration date seems to have been chosen carefully to overshadow Republic Day, on Jan. 26, which commemorates India’s adoption of its Constitution, amended in 1976 to affirm the country as a “socialist, secular, democratic” republic. Those values are fiercely in opposition to what Hindu nationalism has ushered in. The temple inauguration date, which will be celebrated annually, reduces the republic to secondary status next to Mr. Modi’s Hindu utopia. A similar effort has been underway to diminish the importance of Aug. 15, marking Indian independence in 1947. In 2021, Mr. Modi announced that Aug. 14 would henceforth be Partition Horrors Remembrance Day, referring to the bloody division of the country into Hindu-majority India and an independent Muslim Pakistan in 1947, a murderous affair for Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs alike. This was sold to the Indian public as underlining the need for unity, but it was also a reminder from Hindu nationalists that a section of Muslims broke off to form their own nation and that the loyalties of India’s remaining 200 million Muslims were suspect. Given that Hindu rightists participated in massacres, rapes and forced displacement during the partition, Mr. Modi’s weaponization of the suffering seems particularly reprehensible. I was born to a Hindu family, and my father, a refugee from the partition, never blamed Muslims his entire life. There have been countless other such stratagems with the Hindu right in power. The old Parliament building, whose design features refer to India’s syncretic history — Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim and Christian — was replaced last year by a new structure that explicitly reduces India’s past to a monochromatic Hindu one. In the new Parliament, the lotus flower, common in Hindu iconography and the symbol of the Bharatiya Janata Party, runs amok as a motif. A statue atop the building of four back-to-back lions — India’s national symbol and a look back at its Buddhist past — has been altered so that the lions are no longer serene and meditative, as in the original, but snarling, hypermuscular Hindu beasts. Everywhere in India, roads and cities have been renamed to sever connections to centuries of Muslim history in favor of a manufactured Hindu one. On new highways through the state of Uttar Pradesh, where I traveled last summer, gleaming signboards pointed toward concocted Hindu sites but almost never toward the state’s rich repository of Muslim mosques, forts and shrines. Knowledge and culture are being attacked along similar lines. Bollywood, Indian television and the publishing industry have become willing accomplices of Hindu chauvinists, churning out content based on Hindu mythology and revisionist history. In the news media, the few journalists and institutions unwilling to shill for the Hindu cause face legal threats and police raids. In education, government institutions are run by ignorant functionaries of the ruling party, and from school textbooks to scientific research papers, the Hindu nationalist version of India is pushed forward, myth morphing into history. In the private universities that have begun to crop up in India, Mr. Modi’s government keeps a close eye on classes, panels or research that might be construed as criticizing his government or its idea of a Hindu India. This cultural shift and the accompanying reduction of Muslims to alien intruders has been made possible by Mr. Modi delivering on his party’s three main promises to Hindu nationalists. In 2019 he repealed the notional autonomy enjoyed for decades by the disputed Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir, which the Hindu right had assailed as favoritism toward Muslims and victimization of Hindus. Later that year, Mr. Modi delivered on a second promise by introducing a law that ostensibly opened a pathway to Indian citizenship for persecuted minorities from neighboring countries but whose true motive lay in that it pointedly excluded Muslims. In the northeastern state of Assam, a registration process had already been underway to disenfranchise Muslims if they could not provide elaborate documentation of their Indian citizenship. The Bharatiya Janata Party’s declared intention to establish a similar registration system nationwide hangs the threat of disenfranchisement over all of India’s Muslims. The inauguration of the Ram temple delivered on the third and most important electoral promise. It announced, triumphantly, the climax of the battle to turn India into a Hindu nation. And yet after 10 years under Mr. Modi’s government, India is more unequal than it was under colonial British rule. In 2020 and 2021, it surpassed China as the largest source of international migrants to O.E.C.D. countries. Many of the undocumented migrants to be found pleading for entry on the U.S.-Mexico border are from India, and they include Hindus for whom India should be a utopia. The Hindu right’s near-complete control of India may indeed deliver a third term for Mr. Modi, maybe even the absolute parliamentary majority his party wants in order to expand on the transformation it has begun. But the truth is harder to hide than ever. Mr. Modi and his party are giving India the Hindu utopia they promised, and in the clear light of day, it amounts to little more than a shiny, garish temple that is a monument to majoritarian violence, surrounded by waterlogged streets, emaciated cattle and a people impoverished in every way.",sleepy pilgrimage city ayodhya northern india home grand thcentury mosque illegally demolished

nytimes,How A.I. Tools Could Change India’s Elections,"April 18, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/world/asia/india-election-ai.html,"For a glimpse of where artificial intelligence is headed in election campaigns, look to India, the world’s largest democracy, as it starts heading to the polls on Friday. An A.I.-generated version of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that has been shared on WhatsApp shows the possibilities for hyperpersonalized outreach in a country with nearly a billion voters. In the video — a demo clip whose source is unclear — Mr. Modi’s avatar addresses a series of voters directly, by name. However, it is not perfect. Mr. Modi appears to wear two different pairs of glasses, and some parts of the video are pixelated. Down the ladder, workers in Mr. Modi’s party are sending videos by WhatsApp in which their own A.I. avatars deliver personal messages to specific voters about the government benefits they have received and ask for their vote. Those video messages can be automatically generated in whichever of India’s dozens of languages the voter speaks. So can phone messages by A.I.-powered chatbots that call constituents in the voices of political leaders and seek their support. Such outreach requires a fraction of the time and money spent on traditional campaigning, and it has the potential to become an essential instrument in elections. But as the technology races onto the political scene, there are few guardrails to prevent misuse. Chatbots and personalized videos may seem more or less harmless. Experts worry, however, that voters will have an increasingly difficult time distinguishing between real and synthetic messages as the technology advances and spreads. “It’ll be the Wild West and an unregulated A.I. space this year,” said Prateek Waghre, the executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, a digital rights group based in New Delhi. The technology, he added, is entering a media landscape already polluted with misinformation. Around the world, elections have become a testing ground for the A.I. boom. The tools have been used to turn an Argentine presidential candidate into Indiana Jones and a Ghostbuster. During the New Hampshire primary, voters received robocall messages urging them not to vote, in a voice that was most likely artificially generated to sound like President Biden’s. And in India, Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., and the opposition Indian National Congress party have accused each other of spreading election-related deepfake content online. One outpost on this new Indian frontier is in the western desert state of Rajasthan. On the ground floor of a residential building on a dusty back lane, a 31-year-old college dropout, Divyendra Singh Jadoun, operates an A.I. start-up, The Indian Deepfaker. His team of nine people has been making commercials with A.I.-generated avatars of Bollywood actors and actresses. But earlier this year, political parties and politicians began asking him to do for them what he had done for celebrities. Of the 200 requests, Mr. Jadoun said, he took on 14. Among those getting the A.I. treatment is Shakti Singh Rathore, a 33-year-old B.J.P. member. His job this election season is to tell as many people as possible about Mr. Modi’s programs and policies. So he decided to create a replica of himself. “A.I. is wonderful and the way forward,” Mr. Rathore said as he settled in front of a video camera at the office of The Indian Deepfaker, preparing to become digitally incarnated. “How else could I reach the beneficiaries of Mr. Modi’s programs in such large numbers and in so short a period of time?” As Mr. Rathore adjusted a saffron scarf with the party’s logo that hung around his neck, Mr. Jadoun instructed him, “Just look into the camera and talk as if the person is sitting right in front of you.” With about five minutes’ worth of material, including an audio recording and profile shots, Mr. Jadoun went to work. He said he uses open-source A.I. systems and builds upon them with his own code. First, Mr. Rathore’s face was isolated from each frame of the recording. Then data was collected from his facial features, including the size of his face and lips, as well as his gaze. Mr. Jadoun said the data set was then fed into A.I. models that learn to predict facial patterns. “You need to keep running it through the program and fine-tuning the face until you get the best face possible,” he said. A “cloning algorithm” also analyzed the audio recording, learning the voice’s cadence and intonations. Mr. Jadoun said it often takes six to eight hours of tweaking to perfect the face and for the lips to sync with the words. The rest is largely automated. In one demo, it took about four minutes to create around 20 personalized greeting videos. Mr. Jadoun said his team could produce up to 10,000 videos a day. For larger jobs on deadline, it will rent graphics processing units. Generative A.I. can also remove language barriers, which is especially helpful in a linguistically diverse country. Mr. Rathore’s avatar can be programmed to speak regional languages to reach the remotest corners of India. Political parties are not only texting constituents video messages but also using cloned voices to call people directly, all powered by chatbots like ChatGPT. In the past, when a party representative would call voters, they would hang up, Mr. Rathore said. “But now, when a local leader utters a voter’s name, it immediately catches their attention.” During the conversation, the chatbot asks about local government programs that offer free electricity or funding for start-ups. Mr. Jadoun said the calls were recorded and transcribed for quality control and A.I. training. Mr. Rathore said he had spent around $24,000 of his own money to reach about 1.2 million people through his video messages and phone calls and to receive information about who didn’t answer. He called it an investment in his future with the B.J.P. Nikhil Pahwa, the editor of MediaNama, which covers digital media in India, said the personalized messages could be particularly powerful among Indians. “India is a country where people love to take photos with celebrity impersonators,” he said. “So if they receive a call from, say, the prime minister, and he speaks as if he knows them, where they live and what their issues are, they would actually be thrilled about it.” Mr. Waghre of the Internet Freedom Foundation questions whether A.I. content is persuasive enough to affect this year’s election. But he said the long-term effects could be problematic. “Once you normalize this in people’s information diet, what happens six months later when there are deceptive videos?” he said. Mr. Modi himself has discussed adding disclaimers to A.I.-generated content so people are not being “misguided.” Mr. Jadoun and representatives of two other A.I. start-ups in India created what they call an “A.I. coalition manifesto,” pledging to protect data privacy and uphold election integrity. For instance, Indian Deepfaker videos are labeled “A.I. generated,” and its chatbots announce that they are A.I.-generated voices, Mr. Jadoun said. Narendra Singh Bhati, 28, the owner of resorts in Rajasthan, received an A.I.-generated call from Mr. Rathore this week. Mr. Bhati said he was impressed with its personalization. He said he had not realized that the call was A.I.-generated, although the script made that clear. “I even said goodbye to Mr. Rathore” at the end, Mr. Bhati said.",glimpse artificial intelligence

bbc,India's Priyanka Gandhi to finally make electoral debut,13 hrs ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjmmg4pm0m4o,"Priyanka Gandhi, sister of India's main opposition Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, is set to contest her first election, ending decades of anticipation by her supporters. Ms Gandhi is a descendant of the Nehru-Gandhi family, India's most famous political dynasty, and her electoral debut will be closely watched. The 52-year-old will contest the Wayanad seat in the southern Indian state of Kerala after her brother relinquishes it. A win for Ms Gandhi would mean the presence of all three Gandhi family members in the Indian parliament. Her mother Sonia Gandhi, former president of the Congress party, is an MP in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the parliament. Her brother Mr Gandhi won the recent parliamentary elections from both Wayanad and Uttar Pradesh's Rae Bareli seats. Mr Gandhi, who has represented Wayanad as an MP since 2019, is giving it up as he can only retain one parliamentary seat under Indian law. On Monday, he thanked the people of Wayanad for their ""love, affection and support"". A date for the by-election is yet to be announced but Ms Gandhi says she is ""not nervous at all"". ""I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad and I will not let them feel his [Rahul Gandhi's] absence,"" she said on Monday. ""I will work hard and I will try my best to make everyone happy and be a good representative."" The by-election will mark the end of a decades-long wait by Congress supporters for Ms Gandhi's involvement in electoral politics. Journalist Javed Ansari, who has reported on the Congress party for decades, told BBC Hindi that he was not surprised by the announcement. ""I think it was a question of when [she would contest] and not if,"" he said. For years, Ms Gandhi was considered the more popular of the Gandhi siblings with many blaming the ""lacklustre leadership"" of her brother for a string of Congress defeats between 2014 and 2019. From an early age, people have pointed to Ms Gandhi’s resemblance to her grandmother and former prime minister Indira Gandhi. Ms Gandhi was actively involved in the election campaigns of her mother from the late 1990s. She also campaigned for her brother when he actively joined politics in 2004. Senior leaders have praised her political acumen and her flair for engaging with people. Ms Gandhi's official entry into politics came when she was put in charge of the Congress campaign in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh state, ahead of the 2019 general election. The Congress went on to perform poorly in that election and the state assembly polls in 2022, but Ms Gandhi was not blamed. Senior party leaders said the performance was not a reflection of her work and in line with their expectations. Appointed Congress' general secretary in 2019, Ms Gandhi has since overseen the party's campaigns in several state elections. Party leaders say she’s been crucial in stabilising the Congress government in Himachal Pradesh state this year amid rebellion by some of its own lawmakers. She was also at the forefront of the Congress's campaign in Uttar Pradesh state - where opposition parties performed surprisingly well - and especially in the Gandhi family bastions of Amethi and Rae Bareli. ""She held the fort for Rahul and that is how he could campaign across the country,"" Mr Ansari said. Political commentator Neerja Chowdhury said it would be interesting to see the siblings in parliament together if Ms Gandhi wins. “Personally, I think Priyanka is savvier of the two. She thinks on her feet and her language is clearer than his,"" she said, adding that she will be ""watched very closely"". Congress leaders and workers in Kerala have expressed happiness at the possibility of having Ms Gandhi as an MP from Wayanad. ND Ayyappan, president of the party committee in the district, said: ""It indicates that the family will continue its ties with the people of Wayanad."" The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has criticised dynastic politics in response to news of Ms Gandhi's electoral debut. ""Congress is not a party but a family business,"" BJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla said. But the announcement of her candidacy received praise from Annie Raja, a member of the Communist Party of India (CPI) who had contested against Mr Gandhi in Wayanad in the recent election. Ms Raja, who lost the election by a margin of over 360,000 votes, did not confirm whether she would run against Ms Gandhi in the by-election. But she said, ""We need more and more women in parliament."" Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

bbc,Will India's Booker Prize-winning author face jail for 14-year-old remark?,21 hrs ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggyz13m2po,"Will one of India's most celebrated writers really face prosecution for things she said more than a decade ago? Last week, 14 years after the original complaint, Delhi's most senior official granted permission for the Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy to be prosecuted under India’s stringent anti-terror laws. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) is notorious for making it exceptionally challenging to get bail, often resulting in years of detention until the completion of trial. The Modi government has been accused of using the law to silence critics, including activists, journalists and civil society members. Ms Roy, 62, an outspoken writer and activist, is in the dock for comments on Kashmir, a perennial lightning rod in India. “Kashmir has never been an integral part of India. It is a historical fact. Even the Indian government has accepted this,” she said at a stormy, day-long conference in Delhi, organised by the Committee for the Release of Political Prisoners, in October 2010. At the time, Indian-administered Kashmir was in turmoil, with locals describing it as a fierce uprising against India. Ms Roy's remarks had followed the deaths of dozens of protesters since fresh pro-freedom demonstrations broke out earlier that year. India and neighbouring Pakistan, nuclear armed-rivals, claim the disputed region in full and have fought two wars over it. Ms Roy’s remarks predictably set off a firestorm of protest, with many critics questioning her loyalty to India, and the federal government, then led by the Congress party, threatening to arrest her on charges of sedition. A senior minister  said while India enjoyed freedom of speech, ""it can't violate the patriotic sentiments of the people"". There were protests outside Ms Roy's home in an upscale Delhi neighbourhood. A criminal complaint was lodged against her and another defendant Sheikh Showkat Hussain, a law teacher from Kashmir, accusing them and two others of sedition. Ms Roy defended her right to free speech soon after the controversy. ""In the papers some have accused me of giving 'hate-speeches', of wanting India to break up. On the contrary, what I say comes from love and pride,"" she wrote in a response. ""It comes from not wanting people to be killed, raped, imprisoned or have their finger-nails pulled out in order to force them to say they are Indians... Pity the nation that has to silence its writers for speaking their minds."" Lawyers are puzzled by the decision to prosecute Ms Roy more than a decade after her speech. She was originally accused of sedition, but the Supreme Court suspended the colonial-era sedition law in May 2022; invoking UAPA charges allows the state to bypass the statute of limitations and proceed with the case. Ms Roy has been a trenchant critic of Mr Modi's government, which rights groups accuse of targeting activists and muzzling free speech. The permission for her prosecution comes just after Mr Modi's re-election for a third term. Many view this as a political signal that the BJP will continue its strong-arm tactics, even in coalition government. Sushil Pandit, the main complainant from 2010, refused to speculate on the delay. ""Those who sat on these files and decided to act now should explain. There must be an inquiry into why this was delayed, and accountability should follow,"" he told Times Now television. Others view this as another attempt to silence Mr Modi's critics. Writer Amitav Ghosh wrote on X: ""The hounding of Arundhati Roy is absolutely unconscionable. She is a great writer and has the right to her opinion. There should be an international outcry against prosecuting her for something she said a decade ago."" When Delhi authorities approved the case to proceed in court in October, Canadian writer and activist Naomi Klein warned Mr Modi on X: ""You have no idea what you will unleash by pursuing this political prosecution to silence your most eloquent critic."" What exactly transpired on the day when Ms Roy made the comments? In the minutes of the conference, Shivam Vij described it as ""historic in every aspect given the topicality of the issue"". Speakers included a well-known poet, several activists and journalists. Ms Roy anticipated a heated debate. ""She began her speech by asking those who wanted to throw shoes to her to do so now,"" Mr Vij wrote. Shuddhabrata Sengupta, an artist, writer and curator who spoke at the event, wrote  that the only ""provocative actions"" - interruptions, heckling, attempts to throw objects at stage - came from ""self-declared Indian patriots"". They were allowed to speak but were asked not to disrupt the proceedings, he noted. However, Mr Pandit, the Kashmiri activist present at the meeting, had a different view. ""Openly, in the heart of the capital, Delhi, a call for the destruction of the Indian Union as a colonial, occupying state, a state that has subjugated people... had no business to survive. Such statements were made. A call to arms rang out from the podium repeatedly... by Arundhati Roy [among others].""  Over the past two decades, Ms Roy has written several non-fiction books and numerous essays on topics like nuclear weapons, Kashmir, big dams, globalisation, Dalit icon BR Ambedkar, meetings with Maoist rebels, and conversations with Edward Snowden and John Cusack. The God of Small Things, a riveting family saga inspired by her family childhood, picked up the 1997 Man Booker Prize - a ""Tiger Woodesian debut"" gushed John Updike - and made Roy a celebrity writer at 35. The 62-year-old author is also a polarising figure in India. Admirers see her as a leading voice for liberal values and a champion of the marginalised. Critics, however, have burned her effigies, disrupted her events, and she has faced charges of sedition and contempt, even spending a day in jail for protesting against big dams. They find a lot of her non-fiction writings shrill, naïve, adolescent, self-indulgent and simplistic, peddling ""picturesque poverty"". One critic wrote that so often in her essays Ms Roy ""never really gets to grips with the evidence"". Since Ms Roy's 2010 remarks, significant changes have occurred. In 2019, Mr Modi's government revoked Kashmir's semi-autonomous status, dividing the region and reducing its political autonomy under direct federal control. Many believe freedom of expression has also declined: since 2014, India has fallen from 150th to 161st in media freedom rankings by Reporters Without Borders, out of 180 countries. Ms Roy has declined to comment on the latest development. It is unclear if the police have investigated the allegations or have evidence against her and the other accused. Two individuals named in the original complaint have passed away. But one thing is certain. If one of India's most feted writers faces imprisonment under a draconian anti-terror law, it will ignite global condemnation and outrage.  Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

bbc,Indian accused of plotting US Sikh murder pleads not guilty,1 day ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggy5ypj68o,"An Indian man accused of plotting to kill a Sikh separatist in New York City has pleaded not guilty in federal court. Nikhil Gupta appeared for the first time in court on Monday afternoon after being extradited from the Czech Republic and landing in the US on Friday. He is charged by US authorities with trying to hire a hitman to assassinate Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a dual US-Canadian citizen. US prosecutors allege Mr Gupta was directed by an unnamed Indian government official. India denies having anything to do with the alleged plot. Mr Gupta, 52, walked into the Manhattan federal courtroom shortly after 12:30 EDT (17:30 BST) on Monday wearing a blue sweater and black Nike sweatpants, holding his hands behind his back. After waiving the reading of his indictment, Mr Gupta was asked by Judge James Cott to enter his plea. “Not guilty,” his lawyer, Jeff Chabrowe, said on his behalf. Prosecutors asked that Mr Gupta be held in a detention centre until his trial. Mr Gupta’s lawyer said they would file a bail application at a later date, meaning Mr Gupta will be detained for now. His lawyer also complained to the judge during the 20-minute arraignment about the conditions of Mr Gupta's detention. He had not been provided a vegetarian meal since he arrived at a Brooklyn detention facility on Friday, the lawyer said. “Essentially, my client has not been able to eat,” he said. He would also need to be allowed to pray, Mr Chabrowe said. Judge Cott said Mr Chabrowe should speak to him again on Tuesday if those issues had not been resolved. Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Mr Chabrowe called the case “a complex matter for both India and the US”. He said people should refrain from “jumping to conclusions” about the allegations against Mr Gupta. “We will pursue his defence rigorously,” he said. Mr Gupta’s hearing was also attended by several Khalistan activists, including one who held the movement’s flag outside the courthouse. Mr Gupta is scheduled to appear in court again on 28 June. In November, US prosecutors charged Mr Gupta with a plot to kill at least four Sikh separatists in North America, including Mr Pannun. The charges against him carry up to 20 years in prison. Mr Gupta paid $100,000 (£79,000) in cash to a hitman to assassinate Mr Pannun, prosecutors said. The hitman, they added, was an undercover federal agent. Mr Pannun is a dual US-Canadian citizen living in New York. He is the general counsel for Sikhs for Justice, an organisation based in the US that supports the broader Khalistan movement, which calls for an independent homeland for Sikhs, who make up about 2% of India's population. Mr Pannun was designated a terrorist by the Indian government in 2020, an allegation he denies. He was also an associate of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist leader who was shot dead in Canada in his car last year. The murder led to a deterioration in India-Canada ties after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged there were ""credible allegations"" that Delhi had been involved. India denied the accusations. In November, the White House said it had raised the alleged assassination plot against Mr Pannun with India at the most senior level. Indian officials distanced themselves from the alleged plot, saying such actions were against government policy. Delhi said it had formed a committee to investigate the allegations against Mr Gupta. A group of US lawmakers urged Secretary of State Antony Blinken to lead a “strong diplomatic response” that would ensure  all parties involved “are held accountable”, according to a 17 June letter that was obtained by the BBC. The US and India ""have a crucial relationship across multiple domains"", and their ties must ""be grounded in shared commitment to democratic principles and the rule of law"", the letter adds. In January, India's Supreme Court rejected a plea from Mr Gupta which asked it to aid his release and help him get a fair trial. The petition in India claimed Mr Gupta was arrested by ""self-claimed"" US federal agents and had not yet been given a fair trial. India's top court said it would not intervene in the case, adding that it was up to the government to take action. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

bbc,Nine killed in India train crash,1 day ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kkyvq081wo,"Nine people have died and around 41 have been injured in a train crash in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal. The accident occurred when a goods train hit a stationary passenger train, the Kanchenjungha Express, in the New Jalpaiguri area on Monday morning. Dramatic visuals from the accident site showed one wagon of the express train suspended in the air. Authorities say ""human error"" may have led to the crash and a detailed investigation will be held. India has one of the largest train networks in the world with millions of passengers using it daily, but a lot of the railway infrastructure needs to be improved or upgraded. Officials said ambulances and disaster teams were sent to the accident site for rescue efforts soon after the accident. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressed shock and said action was being taken on a ""war footing"". The dead include the driver and the assistant driver of the goods train and the guard of Kanchenjungha Express. ""Rescue operations have been completed,"" Jaya Varma Sinha, CEO of the Railway Board, told a press conference. The injured, she said, were being treated at a medical college in Siliguri city. ""Our first priority is for them to get the best medical aid possible."" The official said that human error seemed to be the likely cause of the accident. ""As per initial investigation, it seems that the driver of the goods train disregarded the signal."" She added that Kavach, an automatic train protection system developed by the Indian Railways, needed to be planned and expanded for West Bengal state. A police official told reporters that the engine of the goods train was damaged while three coaches of the express train were derailed. A rescue official told the Times of India they avoided using gas cutters during the relief efforts because it could endanger the lives of those trapped in the train. He said relief efforts were also slowed by heavy rain in the area. Federal Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said relief teams had worked in close coordination with railway officials to carry out rescue operations. The minister visited the site later in the day. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the incident ""saddening"" and said he had spoken to officials about the rescue efforts. ""Condolences to those who lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured recover at the earliest,"" he wrote on X. He announced a compensation of 200,000 rupees ($2,394, £1,890) for the families of the dead and 50,000 rupees for each of the injured passengers. Mr Vaishnaw later announced an enhanced compensation of 1m rupees for the dead, 250,000 rupees for those with grievous injuries and 50,000 rupees for those with minor injuries. The railways have set up a control desk with a helpline number at Rangapani station, near which the collision took place. Last year, a devastating crash involving three trains in the eastern state of Odisha had killed around 290 people and left more than 1,000 injured. After Monday's crash, India's opposition leaders criticised the government for its ""utter mismanagement"" of the railways. Congress party chief Mallikarjun Kharge alleged Mr Modi's government had turned the railways into a platform for ""self-promotion"". Kunal Ghosh, a member of West Bengal's governing Trinamool Congress (TMC) Party, also blamed Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). ""There is no safety of passengers, no improvement in technology and a lack of maintenance of the service,"" he said. The government and the railway ministry have not responded to these accusations yet. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

bbc,Susannah's grandad ran Bengal when famine killed millions,3 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1vv9r4012xo,"""I feel enormous shame about what happened,"" Susannah Herbert tells me. Her grandfather was the governor of Bengal, in British India, during the run-up and height of the 1943 famine which killed at least three million people. She is only just learning about his significant role in the catastrophe, and confronting a complex family legacy. When I first meet her, she is clutching a photograph from 1940. It's Christmas Day at the governor's residence in Bengal. It's formal, with people sitting in rows, in their finery, staring straight into camera. In the front are the dignitaries - Viceroy Linlithgow, one of the most important colonial figures in India, and her grandfather Sir John Herbert, Bengal's governor. At their feet is a little boy, in a white shirt and shorts, knee-high socks and shiny shoes. It's Susannah's father. He had told her some stories of growing up in India, like the day Father Christmas came in on an elephant, but not much more. But little was spoken of her grandfather, who died in late 1943. The causes of the famine are many and complex. While John Herbert was the most important colonial figure in Bengal, he was part of a wider colonial structure. He reported to his bosses in Delhi, who reported to theirs in London. Dr Janam Mukherjee, historian and the author of Hungry Bengal, tells me Herbert ""was the colonial official most directly linked to the famine because he was the chief executive of the province of Bengal at that time"". One of the policies he executed during World War Two was known as ""denial"", where boats and rice – the staple food – were confiscated or destroyed in thousands of villages. It was done because of the fear of a Japanese invasion and the aim was to deny the enemy local resources to fuel their advance into India. However, the colonial policy was catastrophic for the already fragile local economy. Fishermen couldn't go to sea, farmers weren't able to go upstream to their plots, and artisans were unable to get their goods to market. Critically, rice could not be moved around. Inflation was already high, as the colonial government in Delhi was printing money to pay for the vast war effort on the Asian front. The hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers in Kolkata - then Calcutta - were straining food resources. Rice imports to Bengal from Burma had halted after it fell to the Japanese. Rice was hoarded, often for profit. And a deadly cyclone hit, wiping out much of Bengal's rice crop. Repeated demands - in the middle of the war - to the war cabinet and Prime Minister Winston Churchill for food imports were denied or partially heeded at the time. The numbers who died are overwhelming. I wondered why Susannah, the granddaughter of Bengal’s governor, felt shame so many decades later. She tries to explain. ""When I was young there was something almost glamorous about having a connection with the British Empire."" She says she used to borrow a lot of her grandfather's old clothes. ""There were silk scarves, with a nametape saying 'Made in British India'. ""And now when I see them at the back of a cupboard, I kind of shudder and say, why would I even want to wear these things? Because the words 'British India' on the label seem inappropriate to wear now."" Susannah is determined to know more about her grandfather's life in British India, and to make sense of things. She is reading everything she can on the Bengal famine, going through stacks of her grandparents' papers at the Herbert archive in the family home in Wales. They're kept in a climate-controlled room, and an archivist visits once a month. She starts to realise more about her grandfather. ""There's absolutely no doubt that the policies he implemented and initiated contributed enormously to the scale and impact of the famine. ""He had skills, he had honour. And he should not have been appointed to the post of running the lives of 60 million people in a faraway corner of the British Empire. He just should not have been appointed."" In the family archive she found a letter from Lady Mary, her grandmother, written to her husband in 1939, on hearing he had been offered the job of governor. It's a letter of pros and cons. She clearly had no desire for them to go, though she writes she would accept whatever decision he took. ""You read them [the letters] with hindsight, you read them knowing what the writer and reader did not know. If you could reach out to the past, you'd say: don't do it. Don't go, don't go to India. You will not do a good job."" Over the months I have been following Susannah Herbert’s journey into the past, she has had many detailed questions about her grandfather. She has been keen to meet Janam Mukherjee, the historian, to ask him directly. They meet in June. Janam admits he never imagined he would ever be sitting opposite the granddaughter of John Herbert. Susannah wants to know why her grandfather, a provincial MP and government whip, was appointed in the first place, when he had virtually no experience of Indian politics, beyond a brief spell in Delhi as a young officer. ""It's part and parcel of colonialism and stems from an idea of supremacy,"" Janam explains. ""Some MP who has no colonial experience, who has no linguistic capacities, who has not worked in a political system outside of Britain, can simply go and inhabit the governor's house in Kolkata, and make decisions about an entire population of people that he knows nothing about."" While Herbert was not popular among elected Indian politicians in Bengal, even his seniors in Delhi seem to have doubted his competence, including Viceroy Linlithgow. ""Linlithgow called him the weakest of the governors in India. They, in fact, were interested in removing him, but they were worried about how that might be received,"" says Janam. ""That is hard listening,"" Susannah replies. I am struck that for both there is a personal connection. Janam and Susannah had fathers in Kolkata who were little boys at the same time but were living completely different lives. They've both died now. Susannah at least has photographs. For Janam, there were no pictures of his father as a child. ""So what I knew was from his nightmares and from the few stories he told me of his experience in childhood, in a colonized war zone. ""I come from a sense of trying to think about my father's very damaged life and understand how that impacts me as his descendant."" And then he says something I wasn't expecting. ""My grandfather also worked for the colonial police force. So my grandfather himself was complicit with the colonial system in many ways. So there are these interesting similarities in our motivations of understanding."" At least three million people died in the Bengal famine and there is no memorial - or even a plaque - to them anywhere in the world. Susannah can at least point to a memorial to her grandfather. ""The church where we worship has a plaque honouring him."" She explains it's in the absence of a grave. She's not sure where his remains are, perhaps in Kolkata. Honour is a word that Susannah used to describe her grandfather, even though she acknowledges his failures. ""While I find it relatively easy to accept that history is much more complicated than what we were originally told, I still find it hard to envisage John Herbert […] acting in any way, dishonourably."" Janam takes a different view. ""These questions of intention have never interested me in many ways. I'm much more interested in the historical course of events because I think intentions can always mask what happens."" Eighty years on this is still complicated, and raw. I wonder if months into her research, Susannah still feels ""shame"" is the right emotion to describe how she feels? She tells me she has changed her view. ""I think the word shame centres it too much on my feelings. It's not just about me and what I think. ""It's part of a greater project, I suppose, of understanding and transmitting understanding of how we got to where we are. We? I mean Britain, I mean, this country."" Janam agrees that ""as a descendant of a colonial official, I don't think there is any particular shame that accrues intergenerationally. I think it's Britain's shame. ""I mean people died of starvation in Bengal. So I think there's cause for historical reflection on the individual level as well as the collective level."" Susannah is reflecting on her legacy. She wants to share her findings with her wider family, and she's not sure how they'll receive it. She is hoping her children might help her work her way through the mountains of papers in the family archive in Wales. They too are contending with a complex personal legacy, as Britain tries to figure out what to do with this difficult part of its war story and colonial past. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,India brings back bodies of 45 workers from Kuwait,4 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg330n9x614o,"An Indian Air Force flight has brought back the bodies of 45 workers who were killed in a fire in Kuwait. The fire broke out on Wednesday at a residential building in Mangaf city where 176 Indian workers lived. Kuwaiti authorities said 50 people were killed in the fire, including 45 from India and three from the Philippines. Two bodies are yet to be identified. Dozens of workers, most of them Indian, have also been injured in the fire. Two-thirds of the Kuwaiti population is made up of foreign workers and the country is highly dependent on migrant labour, especially in the construction and domestic sectors. Human rights groups have regularly raised concerns over their living conditions. Indian minister Kirti Vardhan Singh, who had gone to Kuwait after the incident, said DNA tests had been carried out to identify the victims. Among the workers confirmed dead, 23 are from Kerala state, seven from Tamil Nadu, three each from Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, two from Odisha and one each from Bihar, Punjab, Karnataka, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Haryana. Mr Singh said the Indian government had arranged a special Air Force flight to bring back the bodies. The flight landed in Kerala's Kochi city on Friday morning where the bodies of workers from southern Indian states were given to authorities, and then continued to Delhi. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and other state lawmakers were at the airport to receive the bodies and pay homage to them. ""This is a huge tragedy for our country. Kerala's migrant workers are the lifeblood of our state. The fire in Kuwait is one of the biggest tragedies to affect our community,"" Mr Vijayan said. The state and federal governments have announced compensation for the families of those who died in the fire. In Kuwait, authorities say they are carrying out an inspection of health and safety conditions in several buildings that house foreign workers in the country. According to the Arab Times, an investigation by authorities found that the fire started because of an electrical short circuit in the security guard’s room on the ground floor of the six-story building. A senior Kuwait fire department official had on Wednesday said that inflammable material had been used as partitions between rooms and apartments in the building. Kuwait's Public Prosecution department has detained a citizen and some expatriates on charges of manslaughter and negligence for not implementing fire safety measures, the Times reported. After the fire, Sheikh Fahad Yusuf al-Sabah, the country's deputy prime minister, had accused property owners of greed and said violations of building standards had led to the tragedy.

bbc,Can indie games inspire a creative boom from Indian developers?,5 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8vv58ry8q2o,"India might not be the first country that springs to mind when someone mentions video games, but it's one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. Analysts believe there could be more than half a billion players there by the end of this year. Most of them are playing on mobile phones and tablets, and fans will tell you the industry is mostly known for fantasy sports games that let you assemble imaginary teams based on real players. Despite concerns over gambling and possible addiction, they're big business. The country's three largest video game startups - Game 24X7, Dream11 and Mobile Premier League – all provide some kind of fantasy sport experience and are valued at over $1bn. But there's hope that a crop of story-driven games making a splash worldwide could inspire a new wave of creativity and investment. During the recent Summer Game Fest (SGF) - an annual showcase of new and upcoming titles held in Los Angeles and watched by millions - audiences saw previews of a number of story-rich titles from South Asian teams. One of those was Detective Dotson by Masala Games, based in Gujarat, about a failed Bollywood actor turned detective. Industry veteran Shalin Shodhan is behind the game and tells BBC Asian Network this focus on unique stories is “bucking the trend” in India's games industry. He wants video games to become an “interactive cultural export” but says he's found creating new intellectual property difficult. “There really isn’t anything in the marketplace to make stories about India,"" he says, despite the strength of some of the country's other cultural industries. “If you think about how much intellectual property there is in film in India, it is really surprising to think nothing indigenous exists as an original entertainment property in games,"" he says. ""It’s almost like the Indian audience accepted that we’re just going to play games from outside.” Another game shown during SGF was The Palace on the Hill – a ""slice-of-life"" farming sim set in rural India. Mala Sen, from developer Niku Games, says games like this and Detective Dotson are what “India needed”. “We know that there are a lot of people in India who want games where characters and setting are relatable to them,"" she says. Games developed by South Asian teams based in western countries have been finding critical praise and commercial success in recent years. Venba, a cooking sim that told the story of a migrant family reconnecting with their heritage through food, became the first game of its kind to take home a Bafta Game Award this year. Canada-based Visai Games, which developed the title, was revealed during SGF as one of the first beneficiaries of a new fund set up by Among Us developer Innersloth to boost fellow indie developers. That will go towards their new, unnamed project based on ancient Tamil legends. Another title awarded funding by the scheme was Project Dosa, from developer Outerloop, that sees players pilot giant robots, cook Indian food and fight lawyers. Its previous game, Thirsty Suitors, was also highly praised and nominated for a Bafta award this year. Games such as these resonating with players worldwide helps perceptions from the wider industry, says Mumbai-based Indrani Ganguly, of Duronto Games. “Finally, people are starting to see we’re not just a place for outsource work,” she says. “We’re moving from India being a technical space to more of a creative hub. “I’m not 100% seeing a shift but that’s more of a mindset thing. ""People who are able to make these kinds of games have always existed but now there is funding and resource opportunities available to be able to act on these creative visions.” British-Indian game developer Charu Desodt believes the success of titles such as Venba has been thanks to their commitment to authenticity. “They make me feel very proud,"" she says. ""We’re coming to a point where the industry is growing massively, both in terms of hours spent gaming but more importantly in the variety of the games. ""When you have authentic local stories told from the heart, that’s something everyone can relate to.” Charu says funding for ""unique and quirky stories has been an issue"" but recent successes such as Venba and Thirsty Suitors have shown there is an appetite for south Asian stories told by south Asian developers. Some of the industry's biggest companies are also paying attention. Last year, Sony launched its India Hero Project with a goal to “unearth and empower India’s brightest game development talents” via mentorship and funding. Its first cohort of games included slice-of-life games Fishbowl, museum exploration game Mukti and rhythm-action game Suri: the Seventh Note, inspired by mythical Indian stories from the Himalayas to Rajasthan. Meanwhile french publishing giant Ubisoft’s Indie Series has supported Thousand Star Studios in creating Aikyam – a Bollywood-inspired fantasy roleplaying game set to be released this year. Charu says video games and their interactivity allow people to “understand a concept on a very deep level."" “It’s not just about me appreciating my south Asian roots but its about other people really connecting with the authenticity of that experience,” says Charu. “It takes time for an industry to evolve and mature,"" she says. ""We’re in the early days as an industry as a whole, even in the west. ""But people now have access to technology and India is also a nation that loves to tell stories.” Listen to Ankur Desai's show on BBC Asian Network live from 15:00-18:00 Monday to Thursday - or listen back here.

bbc,Forty Indians among 50 dead in Kuwait block fire,5 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9ww0j74rddo,"At least 40 Indians are among 50 people killed in a fire at a residential building in the Kuwaiti city of Mangaf, India's foreign ministry has said. The fire broke out on Wednesday in a building where dozens of workers stayed. Video shared on social media showed flames engulfing the lower part of the building and thick black smoke billowing from the upper floors. Most of the casualties are from the southern Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Around 50 Indians have also been injured. Three Filipinos have also been killed, AFP quoted Philippines officials as saying. Filipino and Nepali workers are also among the injured. Two-thirds of the Kuwaiti population is made up of foreign workers and the country is highly dependent on migrant labour, especially in the construction and domestic sectors. Human rights groups have regularly raised concerns over their living conditions. Local media reports said the building housed 196 workers and there are suggestions that it may have been overcrowded. A senior police officer told state TV that there were a ""large number"" of people in the building at the time of the fire. ""Dozens were rescued, but unfortunately there were many deaths as a result of inhaling smoke from the fire,"" he said, adding that warnings were often issued about overcrowding in this type of accommodation. Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Fahad Yusuf al-Sabah accused property owners of greed and said violations of building standards had led to the tragedy. ""Unfortunately the greed of the property owners is what led to this,"" Sheikh al-Sabah, who is also acting interior minister, told Reuters news agency. ""They violate regulations and this is the result of the violations,"" he said. The original death toll was 49 but Foreign Minister Abdullah Al-Yahya said on Thursday that one person had died overnight, AFP reported. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sent his condolences to the victims and their families. ""The fire mishap in Kuwait City is saddening,"" he said on X. ""My thoughts are with all those who have lost their near and dear ones. I pray that the injured recover at the earliest."" He said the Indian embassy was monitoring the situation and working with the authorities on the ground. Kirti Vardhan Singh, a junior minister in the government who left for Kuwait on Thursday morning, said DNA tests were being carried out to identify the victims. ""An Air Force plane is on the ready. As soon as the bodies are identified, the kin will be informed and our Air Force plane will bring the bodies back,"" he told news news agency ANI. Twenty-four victims are from Kerala state while five are from neighbouring Tamil Nadu. An eyewitness, Manikandan from Tamil Nadu, told BBC Tamil that many of the workers had been on night shifts. ""Some of those who returned to that apartment early in the morning were cooking food after coming back from work,"" he said. ""Once the fire erupted, it spread rapidly. People living in the building were not able to control the fire."" Back home in India, the families of the victims who have been identified are in shock. Umaruddeen Shameer from Kerala's Kollam district worked as a driver for an oil company in Kuwait. His family is stunned after hearing about his death, said a neighbour who picked up the phone at his house. ""He was married just nine months ago when he came on a visit here,"" the neighbour told BBC Hindi without disclosing his identity. ""His parents are not in a condition to speak to anyone."" Another victim, Stephin Sabu, 29, was set to travel home to Kerala's Kottayam district next month, an acquaintance of the family told BBC Hindi. ""His father is unwell and his mother is not able to speak,"" Babu Mathew, a member of the local church, told BBC Hindi, adding that his family had been waiting for Sabu's arrival for the housewarming ceremony of the house that he had built. Others who were waiting desperately for news of their loved ones were left distressed. Earlier on Thursday, Ashrafunnisa from Villupuram in Tamil Nadu had shared her worries about not being able to contact her husband Mohammed Sharief. He was working as a foreman in Kuwait for the past decade and lived in the building which was destroyed. “I last spoke to him on Tuesday afternoon. I haven’t been able to get through to him since then,"" she said. Hours after speaking to the BBC, she got the news of his death. Additional reporting by BBC Tamil Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,The US cricket star who once played for India,7 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511x170v2wo,"In 2015, Saurabh Netravalkar gave up his dreams of playing professional cricket in India and moved to the US to work as a software engineer. “Cricket was over for me. I had no hope or expectation left to play again,” he says. On Wednesday, almost a decade later, he will face the Indian cricket team in a T20 World Cup match at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, New York. But he will do so as part of the US team. As he embarks on his World Cup dream, Netravalkar says the match will be an ""emotional moment"" for a cricketer who once played for India’s Under-19 team. “Many of my former team-mates are now playing for India,” he tells the BBC. But he is unfazed about the prospect of facing his friends in a crucial match. He is full of confidence and it showed in his impeccable bowling last week in a super over that led the US to a historic win against Pakistan. Netravalkar’s is a story of persistence, a love for cricket and, also, the American dream. Born and raised in Mumbai, Netravalkar began playing cricket when he was just 10. His family lived in Malad, a suburb in the western part of the city. After some remarkable performances as a teenager, he was picked to represent India in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand. The tall, left-arm fast bowler emerged as the leading wicket-taker of the tournament for the Indian team. Over the next few years, Netravalkar balanced his pursuit of cricket while studying to become an engineer, graduating in 2013. After that, the bowler says he decided to concentrate on cricket, giving himself two years. During this time, he attempted to get a spot in the national team as well as the Mumbai cricket team. “I got into the [Mumbai] squad too. But I couldn’t cement my place or even get into the Indian Premier League (IPL),” he says. A cricketer’s career usually starts at 23. But Netravalkar says he decided to leave the sport at that point. “I was in two minds. Should I pursue cricket or concentrate on studies?” he says. In 2015, he started studying in Cornell University in the US for a degree in computer science. “It was a difficult decision,” he says. But he could never fully let go of his cricket dreams. During his time as an engineering student in India, he’d already developed CricDeCode, an app to help cricketers analyse their game. At Cornell, Netravalkar saw students play cricket and joined a club to participate in inter-college tournaments. Soon after graduating, Netravalkar got a job with software giant Oracle and moved to California. In San Francisco, Netravalkar began playing club cricket. “They had weekend tournaments. I would work for five days and play on Saturday and Sunday.” It was far from professional cricket, but it was still a chance to play the game. “San Francisco still doesn’t have proper pitches. They play on an artificial pitch that’s more like a synthetic mat,” he says. “But they had soil pitches in a park in Los Angeles - it’s like the Maidan [a famous park] in Mumbai.” Every Friday evening, he would drive for six hours to Los Angeles to play a match on Saturday. Then he’d drive back to play a match in San Francisco on Sunday. “In the club [in Los Angeles], there were three to four players who were part of the American team,” he says. “It was then I got to know that America had a cricket team.” “On long weekends, they organised tournaments in the country, mostly in Florida, where even players from the West Indies would participate.” Those tournaments provided a good platform, but Netravalkar was still not dreaming of playing for the US national team. “I was on a student visa and then a work visa. So there was no question of playing for the team.” The International Cricket Council (ICC), which governs the sport across the world, also had a rule that required Netravalkar to have lived in the US for seven years and be a permanent resident. But the rule changed in 2018 and Netravalkar was picked for the US cricket team. In 2019, the ICC also gave international T20 status to all its associate members, including the US. “Many think it’s easier to play for obscure teams that are considered underdogs,” he says. “But the struggle is even harder here. Playing for associate countries is difficult because they lack basic infrastructure,” he explains. All players in the US team also have full-time jobs and juggle family responsibilities. ""So we practise indoors from 7-9pm.” In a country like the US, distance adds to the struggle of bringing players from different corners to play together. So the team usually meets 10 days before a tournament to practice. The US overcame these odds to progress from the upper divisions of associate cricket to playing the T20 World Cup this year. They have already qualified for the 2026 World Cup. “The standard of local cricket here has gone up,” Netravalkar says. “Major league and minor league made a huge difference because they gave us a chance to play with top players. There are better grounds being made and pitches are improving.” Cricket academies in the country are also nurturing new players. Even as fan following for the sport grows in places like California, Netravalkar says US cricket faces a tough road ahead. “There’s only one tournament in a year where you play five matches in seven days. So all our efforts throughout the year are tested in just those five days.” “If you win, then you can go ahead. Or else there’s nothing.” Before this T20 World Cup, the US beat Bangladesh in a series which boosted their confidence. Then, in the first game of this tournament, they defeated Canada before going on to upset Pakistan. Netravalkar is now preparing to face his old team-mates from India in the match on Wednesday. “It is nice to reconnect with them and I’m happy for what they have achieved - for India and in the IPL,” he says. Despite facing a star-studded team, Netravalkar is optimistic about his team’s chances. “They [India] practise for hours and we had very limited resources. But anything can happen in T20,” he says. “We are positive. We will give our best in those three hours.” Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

bbc,Two Indians recruited by Russia killed in Ukraine,7 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv225e8dpdgo,"India says two of its nationals who had been recruited by the Russian army have been killed in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The Indian foreign ministry said it had urged the Russian authorities to repatriate the bodies of the two deceased. The ministry has also urged Moscow to quickly release and return all Indian nationals who are with the Russian army. Moscow is yet to comment. Dozens of Indians have reportedly been duped by agents into fighting for Russian forces with the lure of money and a Russian passport. The BBC has spoken to some of them. Some said they were coerced into taking up combat roles in the Russian army. Others have also enlisted of their own accord. ""We regret to state that two Indian nationals who had been recruited by the Russian Army have recently been killed in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine,"" the foreign ministry statement said, without naming the victims. The ministry also urged Indian nationals to ""exercise caution while seeking employment opportunities in Russia"". In May Indian police arrested four people allegedly linked to a network of human traffickers on suspicion of luring young men to Russia with the promise of jobs or education, only to force them to fight in Ukraine. At least two other Indians died earlier this year while fighting for Russian forces. Despite urging Russia to return Indian nationals serving in the Russian army, India has refused to condemn the Kremlin over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, urging the two sides to seek peace through dialogue and diplomacy. Meanwhile Nepal and Sri Lanka have warned their citizens not to be lured in by the false promises of human traffickers in recent months, after it emerged that hundreds of their nationals were taking part in the war as mercenaries. Kathmandu says at least 20 Nepalese have died fighting for Russia. At least 16 former Sri Lankan soldiers have been killed in the conflict so far, most of them for the Russian army. Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry raised the issue with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Monday, the ministry said. It was agreed that ""no further recruitment from Sri Lanka will be done"", the ministry said. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

bbc,Nine Hindu pilgrims killed in bus attack in India's Jammu,10 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggm5j0lzzo,"Nine people have died and 33 injured after suspected militants fired on a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims in the Indian federal territory of Jammu and Kashmir, police officials said. Officials had initially said after the incident on Sunday that the death toll was 10, but revised the figure later. They said that the driver lost control after the attack, causing the bus to plunge into a gorge in Reasi district of Jammu. While rescue operations have concluded, a search operation by the Indian army and police is under way to track down the attackers.  Officials said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken ""stock of the situation"" and asked for the best medical care to be provided to the injured. ""All those behind this heinous act will be punished soon,"" Manoj Sinha, the region's top administrator, wrote on X (formerly Twitter). Mr Sinha has announced a compensation of 1m rupees ($12000; £9400) to the next of kin of the deceased and 50,000 rupees to the injured. The bus was on its way to the base camp of the famous Hindu shrine of Mata Vaishno Devi when it was fired upon. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack yet but Mohita Sharma, the district police chief, told Reuters that suspected militants had ""ambushed the bus"". The Himalayan region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for over six decades. Since 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two wars over the Muslim-majority territory, which both claim in full but control in part. Since 1989, Indian-administered Kashmir has also seen an armed insurgency against Delhi's rule, claiming thousands of lives. Delhi accuses Islamabad of harbouring militants and disrupting peace in the region, a charge Pakistan denies. The news of the attack broke as Mr Modi took oath as India's prime minister for the third consecutive term at a swearing-in ceremony in Delhi. On Monday, the Jammu police released the names of the victims, including the driver of the bus. They are from the states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Two of the victims are children, aged two years and 14. Some survivors spoke to ANI news agency about their ordeal. One of them said the driver had been shot and that the firing didn't stop even after the bus fell into the gorge. Amit Shah, who was home minister in Mr Modi's previous government, expressed grief over the incident. ""The culprits of this dastardly attack will not be spared and will face the wrath of the law,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Rahul Gandhi, the leader of main opposition party Congress, questioned the security situation in the region. ""This shameful incident is the true picture of the worrying security situation in Jammu and Kashmir,"" he wrote on X.

bbc,Narendra Modi sworn in for third term at grand ceremony in Delhi,9 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggnm7r75yo,"Narendra Modi has been sworn in as India's prime minister for a third term in a grand ceremony at the presidential palace in Delhi. The leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party took his oath, saying he would ""do right to all manner of people without affection or ill-will"". Mr Modi's BJP-led National Democratic Alliance won the general election with 293 seats, a much lower margin than predicted by exit polls. The election saw a resurgence of India's opposition, which won 234 seats. Thousands of guests have been attending his inauguration at Delhi's presidential palace. Among them are the heads of neighbouring Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives - but not Pakistan or China. Tight security has been in place in Delhi, which was declared a no-fly zone, with more than 2,500 police officers deployed around the venue. Speaking as he was sworn in by President Draupadi Murmu, Mr Modi said he would uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India and govern with ""true faith and allegiance to the constitution"". He said: ""I will do right to all manner of people in accordance with the constitution and the law without fear or favour."" A council of ministers of Mr Modi's new cabinet were also sworn in during the ceremony. Mr Modi, 73, is only the second Indian leader to win a third consecutive term after the country’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Exit polls had projected outright victory for his Hindu Nationalist BJP party, which ruled India for a decade, but it lost its parliamentary majority in the general election. His NDA bloc relied on two key allies, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the Janata Dal (United) JD(U), to cross the 272-seat mark needed to form the government. On Friday, the elected MPs voted Mr Modi as the leader of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the parliament), leader of the BJP parliamentary party, and leader of the NDA. It is not clear what concessions his allies may have negotiated in return for their support. India media report that several are seeking key ministerial posts. The opposition INDIA alliance, led by the Congress party, has called the election a mandate against Mr Modi's government. Mr Modi, however, countered this on Friday, saying: ""Opposition tried to paint 2024 Lok Sabha results as a loss for us. But we didn’t lose, we never lost, we will never lose."" Mr Modi thanked voters for their mandate, and said he would ""do everything"" to eradicate corruption and poverty. ""Empowering the poor and middle class is our priority,"" he said. During his election campaign, Mr Modi and his party were accused by critics of using hate speech, attacking the country's Muslim minority, and jailing opposition figures. On Friday, the prime minister-elect said the NDA alliance was ""committed to the principle of ""sarva panth sambhava"" (religious equality). The INDIA alliance has said it will fulfil its duty in parliament by holding the government in check and protecting the constitution. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

bbc,Will coalition turn domineering Modi into a humbler leader?,9 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn00xl6n8ldo,"India is no stranger to coalition governments. Some of the world’s largest coalitions, comprising between six and a dozen parties, have been formed in the world's most populous democracy. From 1989 to 2004, six general elections produced no single-party majority. Some of these coalitions have been particularly chaotic: between 1989 and 1999, eight were formed and many quickly collapsed. But some of India’s most significant economic reforms and highest growth rates have come under coalition governments, led by both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Now, for the first time since 2014, India will have a coalition government, with no single-party majority. Narendra Modi of the BJP, set for a third term as prime minister, has seen his majority reduced by a resurgent opposition, and now primarily relies on two allies in his National Democratic Alliance (NDA) for a parliamentary majority. But will Mr Modi, who always ruled with a majority as chief minister of Gujarat state and as India’s prime minister, and dominated politics for a decade, be able to run a coalition? Can he shed his domineering style and carry disparate regional allies along? And will he curb a growing personality cult stoked by his party and a friendly media to adopt a more consensual, humbler image? Many believe it's unlikely to be smooth sailing for Mr Modi in a coalition. The two allies that Mr Modi is most dependent on are two regional parties, Janata Dal (United) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP). They have 28 seats between them. Both are led by veteran, astute leaders - Nitish Kumar and N Chandrababu Naidu, respectively - who have previously served in BJP-led federal coalition governments and then quit over differences with the ruling party, specifically over Mr Modi. In 2019, while serving as Andhra Pradesh chief minister, Mr Naidu labeled Mr Modi, then his political rival, a ""terrorist"". Politics makes for strange bedfellows - India is no stranger to that fact. Coalition governments dependent on just two or three allies are particularly vulnerable to collapse if even one withdraws support. Many believe a coalition government under Mr Modi could contribute to a healthier democracy. They say it could reduce the prime minister's dominance, decentralise governance, increase checks and balances, embolden the opposition, and make institutions like the bureaucracy, judiciary and media more independent. Atal Behari Vajpayee, one of the BJP’s stalwarts, ran a successful multi-party coalition government from 1998 to 2004. The avuncular leader privatised state-owned firms, facilitated foreign investment, built expressways, relaxed trade barriers, and even ignited an IT revolution. He ended a decades-old moratorium on nuclear tests, eased tensions with Pakistan and built closer ties with US. Much of this had to do with Mr Vajpayee’s consensual style. But Mr Modi’s coalition is vastly different from the ones in the past. Despite securing fewer than the 272 seats needed for a majority government, the BJP still took 240 seats, so remains an influential and dominant coalition leader. And in the past, successful minority governments have been run with even less seats. Congress were able to run a successful minority government with 232 seats in 1991- and with just 145 and 206 seats in 2004 and 2009. Furthermore, Mr Modi leads an aggressive and revamped BJP. Amit Shah, his closest confidant, embodies a redefined top leadership that Congress leader Shashi Tharoor characterises as a ""my way or the highway"" approach to governance. In the past, BJP-led coalitions put the party’s key ideological and polarising issues on the backburner to accommodate the demands of their allies. Much of the party's agenda – revoking the autonomy of Kashmir, building the Ram temple – has already been achieved under Mr Modi's leadership. Will his allies now urge him to tone down his divisive rhetoric, particularly against Muslims, which he used freely during the election campaign? Effective coalition politics demands collective action to function as a bloc and offer checks and balances. The key question now is what major issues the coalition partners and the BJP can agree upon. Mr Modi’s party has been pushing for a controversial plan to hold simultaneous federal and state elections, something India gave up in 1967. His party has also promised an Uniform Civil Code or UCC, a single personal law for all citizens, irrespective of religion, sex, gender and sexual orientation. This has been resisted in the past by both the country’s majority Hindus and minority Muslims. Then there’s the delicate issue of redrawing of parliamentary boundaries, due after 2026. The wealthier, less populated southern states fear that Mr Modi will expand parliament, with the seat count favouring the poorer, more populous Hindi heartland states - a traditional BJP stronghold. Mr Modi will also have to listen to regional and state-specific demands from the allies and accommodate their leaders' ambitions. Both the TDP and JD(U) have demanded special status for their states, which mean more federal funds. The allies, according to media reports, are also eyeing influential ministries. Despite a rebounding economy fuelled by government spending, Mr Modi needs to create more jobs and boost incomes for the poor and middle class. India’s economy requires many structural reforms in agriculture, land and labour. Mr Modi may need a consultative approach with allies to achieve any of this. For a man used to basking in the spotlight, consensual politics may not come easily to Mr Modi, many believe. ""He has suddenly been asked to enact a role that he has never done before in his life,"" says Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a biographer of the prime minister . But successful politicians master the art of reinvention. Will India now see a humbler, more consultative and consensual Mr Modi? “We will have to wait and see,” says Sandeep Shastri, a political analyst. “We have to view this through the lens of current circumstances, not past alliances.” Watch this space.

bbc,The temple storming still affecting Sikhs today,8 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw99rgv397go,"Members of the Sikh community have been recalling what their families endured during one of the most brutal periods in the history of their faith. It is 40 years since Indian armed forces stormed the Golden Temple in Amritsar in Punjab, to remove Sikh separatists who were demanding an independent homeland, called Khalistan. About 400 people, including 87 soldiers, were killed during Operation Blue Star, which was ordered by then prime minister, Indira Gandhi. But Sikh groups dispute this figure, claiming thousands died. Sikhs across the world accused troops of desecrating the faith's holiest shrine, and tensions led to an armed insurgency lasting more than a decade. Here, Sikhs in Bedfordshire recount how the events of June 1984 have left lasting scars. Rasal Singh is a volunteer in the Sikh temple in Luton, and runs a business in Bedfordshire. His father, Nirmal Singh Chola Sahib, was killed in November 1990. He said: ""My father was arrested and taken to the local police station where he was tortured severely... It was tragic, he was brutally tortured."" The father of three said his family ""still suffer today"". ""The pain is still so raw, the absence of my father has left a void that never truly heals he was tortured and killed, it’s left a huge hole in my heart,"" he said. ""After my dad was killed, my family became homeless, moving from place to place. Even after 40 years, my family is still hurting, and no justice has been served. ""I channel my pain into being a better parent, hoping to give them the sense of completeness that I missed. ""Every hug, every word of encouragement, every moment spent with them is a step towards healing."" Gurjit Singh, from Luton, said his uncle, Paramjit Singh, was a police officer in Punjab before he was killed in the 1990s. He said: ""Innocent people were often tortured and targeted simply for wearing turbans or having beards. ""The police frequently harassed women under false pretences."" He said his uncle became a target for harassment himself while trying to protect a group of women from his colleagues. ""They even targeted his family, including my father, who was also a police officer,"" he said. ""My uncle had to flee the village, but eventually, they found him, tortured him in jail for 10 days, and then killed him in the fields, staging his death as an escape attempt."" He said that his uncle fled, the whole family was arrested, including children and grandparents. One family member was nine months' pregnant and was denied medical care, suffering a stillbirth. “Today after 40 years of fighting for justice, we still don’t have it,"" Mr Singh said. ""Even political parties did not intervene. ""Punjab was in a state of lawlessness and danger. Our family has been shattered, and three generations have been unable to live a normal life."" Harjinder Singh, from Bedford is a Sikh Activist for Sovereign Roots. The campaign group provides education toolkits on the Sikh religion and political history of Punjab from the times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. He said: ""As we mark 40 years since the tragic attack on Sri Darbar Sahib in Amritsar, we remember the thousands of lives lost, including men, women, and children. ""An entire generation has been killed, leaving families and the global Sikh community in enduring pain. ""Today, we find ourselves with no refuge or voice to hear our pleas for justice. The memories of our lost loved ones demand that we seek an independent country, free from the oppression we have faced in India."" Follow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

bbc,India opposition accuses Modi of 'stock market scam',7 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cekkddndldeo,"Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has demanded an investigation into a stock market crash that hit investors at the end of the general election. He accused top Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders of making misleading predictions about stock prices surging after 4 June, the day the results were announced. Mr Gandhi, from the Congress party, claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi encouraged people to buy stocks before this, which led to them losing money when the market crashed. Mr Modi's party, the BJP, has denied the allegations. Mr Gandhi has demanded that a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigate the alleged scam and the role of Mr Modi and senior ministers. He alleged that weeks before election results, Mr Modi, ex-Home Minister Amit Shah, and former Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman advised people to ""buy stocks before 4 June"", suggesting that the market would surge after, anticipating a BJP victory. In May, Mr Shah told NDTV news channel in an interview: ""Stock market crashes should not be linked with elections, but even if such a rumour has been spread, I suggest that you buy (shares) before 4 June. It will shoot up."" Mr Gandhi has labelled it ""the biggest scam"" in India's stock market history, alleging that the manipulation benefited certain ""dubious foreign investors"", causing Indians to lose trillions of rupees. Mr Modi's departing trade minister, Piyush Goyal, has refuted the allegations, accusing Mr Gandhi of misleading investors. Exit polls had predicted that the BJP would comfortably win a majority - securing more than 272 seats in the 543 member parliament - while together with its alliance partners, this figure would touch 360-370. However, the results were drastically different from these predictions, with the BJP failing to reach the halfway mark on its own and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) getting just 293 seats. Mr Gandhi has now claimed that the exit polls were ""fake"" and that the BJP knew that it was not going to win more that 220 seats ""from its internal survey and the feedback from the intelligence agencies"". ""Despite that, the exit polls were made to show that the BJP was winning a large number of seats,"" Mr Gandhi alleged. This, he alleged, led to massive buying of stocks on 3 June. When the results came out the next day, the Indian stock market saw one of its worst crashes in years, with investments worth billions of dollars being wiped out. The BJP's Mr Goyal said that it was Indians who gained from the rise and fall in stock prices, since in April and May, when the market was on an upswing, foreign investors had sold shares which Indians had bought. And this happened again on 4 June, when the market crashed, he said. ""So foreigners bought at a high price and sold at a low price. Indian investors sold at a high price and bought at a low price. So in a way, Indian investors earned even in this period. No one suffered a loss,"" he said. On Friday, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that Mr Goyal's explanation was ""rubbish"" and added that it did not answer specific questions raised by Mr Gandhi. The BJP has not responded to Mr Ramesh's allegations. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

bbc,India’s opposition looked down and out – now they’re back,5 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp00jze920eo,"The results of India’s general election announced on Tuesday are being interpreted in a rather unusual way. While the winners appear subdued, the runners-up are celebrating. The NDA alliance, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has won a historic third term in power, with more than 290 seats in the 543-member parliament. But his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on its own did not reach the magic figure of 272 seats needed to form the government – and the prime minister is now being seen as a much diminished leader. The outcome is being seen as a huge comeback for the opposition INDIA alliance and Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi, the face of the bloc. The alliance has won just over 230 seats and doesn’t have the numbers to cobble together a government – but more than 24 hours after counting of votes began, they were yet to concede. “It’s an extraordinary story,” political analyst Rashid Kidwai told the BBC. “The result is surprising. The opposition has managed to pull off the unexpected.” A jubilant Congress party called the verdict “a moral and political defeat for Mr Modi"", whose BJP had campaigned predominantly on his name and record. On Tuesday evening, Mr Gandhi told a press conference that “the country has unanimously sent a message to Mr Modi and [Home Minister] Amit Shah that we do not want you”. There’s a backdrop to this exuberance. Going into the election, the opposition seemed in complete disarray and the Congress-led INDIA bloc, made up of more than two dozen disparate regional parties, appeared to be on the verge of imploding. Experts questioned whether it was fit to challenge Mr Modi, who looked unstoppable at the time. And as the election neared, the opposition faced an uphill battle. Parties and leaders were raided by government agencies; two chief ministers – including Arvind Kejriwal of Delhi – were jailed; and bank accounts belonging to Congress were frozen by the income-tax authorities. The credit for the opposition’s performance, Mr Kidwai says, largely goes to Mr Gandhi, the much criticised scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. His great-grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru was the first and longest-serving prime minister of India. His grandmother and father also served as PM. “He’s a fifth generation dynast and came with a lot of historical baggage,” the political analyst explains. “The mainstream media in India was very hostile to him and social media didn’t take him seriously. He was targeted and projected as a non-serious politician who took too many holidays.” But, Mr Kidwai says, he overcame the odds and, in recent years, has worked hard to change that impression of himself and his party. “During his Bharat Jodo Yatra and the Nyay March through the length and breadth of the country, he met millions of people – which added to his stature and won him lots of support. It also gave him confidence and political heft.” But Mr Gandhi was still not perceived as a threat to Mr Modi. Last year, a court in Mr Modi’s home state Gujarat convicted the Congress leader of defamation. He was thrown out of parliament and barred from contesting elections – until the Supreme Court suspended his conviction. The perception that the BJP was seeking to go after the opposition, says political analyst and author Ajoy Bose, backfired. “The BJP got a bit arrogant and complacent. But their shock and awe tactics to intimidate the opposition worked against the BJP and led to the formation of the INDIA bloc.” The parties, he says, “were afraid they would be wiped off and many saw echoes of Emergency [a reference to the 1975 action of then-PM Indira Gandhi to suspend elections and curb civil rights] in the way the government was functioning”. India has “a history of competitive democracy”, Mr Bose says, adding that among the people “there was a sense of disquiet and discomfort about the country turning into a one-party dictatorship”. As the results show, the BJP juggernaut met strong resistance in several opposition-ruled states. In Tamil Nadu, the ruling DMK party kept the BJP out by winning all 39 seats in the state. In West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee fought to limit the BJP to 12 seats (Mr Modi’s party had won 18 of the 42 seats in 2019). In Maharashtra, the BJP was limited to nine seats – it had won 23 of the 48 seats in 2019 and its then-ally Shiv Sena had bagged a further 18. But the biggest upset for Mr Modi and the BJP, Mr Bose says, came from the bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh (UP). “Akhilesh Yadav and his Samajwadi Party (SP) is the biggest success story of this election. A very clever alliance with Rahul Gandhi won them 43 of the state’s 80 seats. The BJP’s tally has been restricted to a poor 33.” Mr Modi's party won 62 seats in 2019 and took 71 in 2014. In the run-up to the election, Mr Modi had described Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav as “a pair of boys” whose alliance had “flopped” many times in the past. But as the results show, this pair of boys soundly beat the BJP in UP. “A key takeaway from the election,” Mr Bose says, “is that the grand new Ram temple in Ayodhya city wasn’t enough for the BJP to win.” The party had banked on the Ram Mandir temple to be their trump card, with Mr Modi presiding over the opening of the unfinished temple in Ayodhya with much fanfare in January. But in the Faizabad constituency, where it is located, the BJP candidate lost. Abhishek Yadav, an SP youth-wing leader and a star campaigner for his party, told the BBC that initially they too believed that the temple would help the BJP win the key state. “Until early April, [the] election in the state had seemed like a one-sided contest with the odds stacked against us,” Mr Yadav told me recently. “But we sensed there was an undercurrent of resentment against the BJP when large numbers of people started gathering at our rallies.” People were unhappy about a lack of jobs and high food and fuel prices, he said. Many were also angry with the changes in how army soldiers are recruited. “With the Congress and SP fighting the election together as part of INDIA alliance, all anti-BJP voters came together to vote for us,” he added. Mr Kidwai says that – notwithstanding the surprisingly good performance of the opposition – in some ways, it was a missed opportunity, as the INDIA bloc failed to read the voters’ minds and did not sense the disquiet they felt with Mr Modi’s government. “They spoke about joblessness, rural economic distress and were able to win over many voters – but there were lots of gaps in their strategy,” he says. “The NDA’s third term has come only because of weaknesses in the INDIA bloc. They could have forged alliances in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and that would have made their tally stronger.” But now that the NDA – and Mr Modi – are back in power, INDIA needs to institutionalise its alliance and Mr Gandhi, “the chief architect of the alliance”, must lead from the front, Mr Kidwai adds. “It’s unlikely that the government will stop going after the opposition. But it also can’t be business as usual for the government. They cannot continue with their politics of vendetta; it will have to be toned down. “The strength of opposition in parliament would allow restoration of functional ties in parliament. There’s great need for coalition politics now. And Congress as the single largest opposition party in the coalition must lead from the front. “The Gandhis consider themselves as trustees of power, not power-wielders. But now the time has come to change. Rahul Gandhi has to take on the mantle of leadership and lead.” Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

bbc,Full report: Stunning blow for Modi as alliance heads for reduced majority,4 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vv93pz14zo,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has claimed a historic third win in a row in the country's parliamentary elections, but his ruling alliance appears to have failed to win a large majority as predicted. He thanked voters and said he would continue the ""good work"" of the last decade. Mr Modi’s BJP-led alliance is leading in more than 290 of 543 seats up for grabs, well short of their target of 400. The Congress and other allied opposition parties have surprised observers, and are now expected to win more than 230. The results give the lie to a slew of exit polls at the weekend that showed the BJP-led NDA alliance on course for a super majority of two-thirds of parliament, which would have allowed it to make changes to the constitution.  In his first remarks since the election, though, the prime minister was keen to stress his historic third victory. ""I bow to the people for this affection and assure them that we will continue the good work done in the last decade to keep fulfilling the aspirations of people,"" he said on X. Speaking to supporters later, he described his victory as ""the biggest in the world"" and said he was ""very very happy today"". But Rahul Gandhi - leader of the opposition Congress party - told reporters  that Mr Modi and the BJP had been ""punished"" by voters at the ballot box. Analysts attribute the BJP's setback to rising prices, joblessness, a controversial army recruitment reform and Mr Modi's aggressive and divisive campaign, which may have alienated voters in parts of the country. Mr Modi had set a target of 370 seats for the BJP and 400 seats for his alliance. This was up from the 303 seats won by the BJP alone in the last general election in 2019. However, the BJP is no longer expected to get the 272 seats on its own that are needed for a majority in the lower house of parliament. This is a setback for the party and means - for the first time - Mr Modi would have to rely on smaller parties in the NDA  to push through its agenda. There has been speculation that Mr Gandhi might also try to form a government, but two key NDA parties have already pledged their support for the incumbent prime minister. Some of the major developments of the election include:  The election was seen by many as a referendum on Mr Modi's decade in office, during which he has transformed many aspects of life in India, so this would be a major upset. The mood in BJP offices around the country has been described by BBC reporters as ""sombre"". In contrast, at Congress headquarters, party workers have been celebrating. The Indian markets, meanwhile, have been showing jitters - falling more than 2% - testifying to the fact that it’s not been a runaway result so far for the governing alliance. An average 66% of voters took part in the election, official figures showed. It was the biggest such exercise the world has ever seen, with nearly a billion registered voters – about one in eight of the global population. Voting was staggered over seven rounds between 19 April and 1 June for security and logistical reasons. Much of the election took place in extreme and deadly heat as temperatures in parts of India soared to nearly 50C. The BJP and its rivals fought a fierce - at times vitriolic - campaign, with the prime minister denying that he was being divisive when he was accused by rivals of demonising Muslims. Mr Modi toured the country, pointing to his achievements in areas such as delivering welfare schemes and raising India’s global profile. Opposition parties highlighted cost of living issues, high unemployment - especially for young people - and fears that constitutional changes could disempower the disadvantaged. They also promised to stop India’s “slide into autocracy”. A number of opposition leaders and government critics have been jailed in recent years, including Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal who was taken into custody on corruption charges in April but later briefly released to allow him to campaign.

bbc,What worked for India's Modi - and what didn’t?,4 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce442577v35o,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP looks to have won the most seats in this year's election.

bbc,BBC India reporters on why some voters said no to Modi,4 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5113nvjevxo,"When Narendra Modi set his sights on a barnstorming victory - 400 out of 543 seats  for his alliance - few scoffed at the ambition. After all, the Indian prime minister and his BJP have been a largely unstoppable force since coming to power a decade ago. But while Mr Modi and his alliance are on course to win a majority, it is not quite the untouchable win he and his allies envisioned when counting began this morning. Below, BBC correspondents in India give their thoughts on why we arrived at results few expected - and what it could mean for the world's largest democracy going forward. Religion is a factor in every Indian election, and this one was no different. Mr Modi inaugurated a Hindu temple at a controversial site that had been disputed between Hindus and Muslims in January and this was expected to give his party a big boost during the election. But no one quite expected the BJP’s campaign to be as polarising as it was - or for some of the most aggressive comments to come from the very top. At a campaign rally in April, Mr Modi said: “When their (the opposition Congress) government was in power they had said Muslims have the first right on the nation’s wealth. This means they’ll collect the wealth and give it to whom? To those who have many children. To infiltrators.” Some analysts interpreted the remark as an attempt by Mr Modi to galvanise his conservative Hindu support base. But looking at the results from some key constituencies – the BJP candidate has lost in the temple city of Ayodhya -  it doesn’t appear to have had the desired effect. Questions are now being raised about using the Hindu card as a campaign tool, especially since what it seems to have achieved is the opposite - uniting Muslim minorities against the BJP. Marketing consultants have attributed Narendra Modi’s enduring popularity to his mastery of branding, transforming routine events into spectacles and astute messaging. “He strikes a deep chord with his aura of clarity and strength, speaks simultaneously to anxieties and aspirations, communicates using emotionally resonant metaphors, understands the power of branding key initiatives to generate a sense of activity and purpose and knows the power of enigmatic silence,” Santosh Desai, a well-known brand consultant, wrote in 2017. Over the years, Mr Modi also sold himself as a cultural icon engaging a diverse people both at home and abroad, cementing his status as an influential leader in Indian politics. A weak opposition and a largely friendly media helped him build his brand.  “He’s pop culture in 70% of this country,” a brand consultant said at a conclave last year. No longer. As results of the general elections show, Brand Modi is beginning to fray. Mr Modi has never underperformed and won less than a majority in all the elections he has fought so far. It has been different this time. Tuesday’s results show that some of the sheen may be wearing off and even Mr Modi is not immune to the vagaries of anti-incumbency. Since the July 2023 formation of the opposition INDIA alliance, a grouping of more than two dozen parties, the Modi-led government has been painting it as a ragtag bunch of self-serving leaders out to personally target Mr Modi and destroy the country. While the leaders of the ruling BJP, along with most analysts and pollsters, had for months been predicting an easy win for Mr Modi, the Congress-led opposition block  kept emphasising rural distress, inflation and rampant unemployment in its messaging and public meetings. ""The Constitution is in danger"" and the country’s “democratic institutions are under attack” under a “divisive” Mr Modi was their war cry. A 4,200 miles (6,700 km) long march by Rahul Gandhi, a senior leader of the Congress party, that began months before the elections was heavily panned for its timing, but analysts believe it enthused supporters and galvanised party cadres. The opposition also upped its social media reach and aggressively took on the BJP which has for a long time dominated the digital landscape in India. Mr Modi's BJP is still struggling to make a major impact in southern India, although its vote share is set to increase. It won 25 seats in Karnataka alone in 2019. But this time it is losing at least 10 seats in the same state to the Congress party. It is on the verge of doubling the four seats it won in Telangana and a couple of seats in Andhra Pradesh because of its alliance with the regional Telugu Desam Party, headed by the IT industry friendly Chandrababu Naidu. In Tamil Nadu, the regional DMK led alliance is on the verge of repeating its 2019 performance of a clean sweep. And in Kerala, the Communist government and the Congress-led front seem to have kept the BJP from the Lok Sabha. In short, the development focused welfare schemes of the non-BJP parties appear to be making a better connect with the aspirations of the voters down South. Mr Modi projected himself as the voice of the Global South – a leader who acted as a bridge between the developing and the developed world. The Indian PM’s global heft was grounded in the massive support he had at home. He provided a sense of continuity to global leaders and alliances. Mr Modi will now head a coalition government. He is likely to have bipartisan support on foreign policy, but he will have to take allies into confidence before taking crucial decisions that affect global politics. That might force him to slow down, and adopt a more consultative decision making policy. So far India has defiantly practised its policy of strategic autonomy in foreign affairs, and that might not change. But what will change is Mr Modi’s ability to take quick decisions on global affairs – something he often did without consulting his own allies or the opposition. Be it as Gujarat state chief minister or as prime minister in his last two terms, Narendra Modi has run a full majority BJP government. Coalition partners did come along to give a hand, but the government’s future was never in their hands. Current numbers clearly indicate the BJP is falling short of majority which means Mr Modi will seek support from allies. He has got used to running a centralised government and party under him which will have to change keeping the new reality in mind. He will need to be a lot more mindful of the concerns and sensitivities of coalition partners and that doesn’t come easy to him, one analyst noted. India is not new to coalition politics, but coalition governments are often prone to instability. So it would be a litmus test for both Mr Modi and the BJP over their adaptability to a changed scenario. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

bbc,Heat kills more than 50 people in India in three days,3 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cprrv9zp8wyo,"More than 50 people have died in India over the past three days as a brutal heat spell continues to grip parts of the country. Around 33 people died in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh over the weekend due to the heat. These included people involved in the general election, including polling officials, security guards and sanitation staff - Saturday was the last phase of voting. In Odisha (Orissa) state, about 20 people died due to heat stroke, officials said. Every five years, India holds its general election in the summer months of April and May. But this year, the temperatures have been record-breaking, with the country experiencing frequent, more intense and longer heatwaves. The federal health ministry says that there have been at least 56 confirmed heat strokes deaths from 1 March to 30 May. About 24,849 heatstroke cases were reported during the period. However, state-wise figures suggest the actual number could be much higher. In Odisha, district authorities reported 99 suspected heat stroke deaths in the past 72 hours - of these, 20 cases have been confirmed, the state's Special Relief Commissioner said in a statement. In Uttar Pradesh, Navdeep Rinwa, chief electoral officer of the state, told reporters that the families of deceased election personnel would be given a monetary compensation of 1.5m rupees ($18,000; £14,000). Mr Rinwa said that a man who was standing in the queue to vote fainted because of the heat. “The voter was transported to a health facility, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival,” he said. Suspected heat-related deaths have also been reported from the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. India's National Centre for Disease Control calls heat strokes a ""life-threatening"" condition with a mortality rate of 40-64%. The heat in northern and central India and parts of the west has been unrelenting for the past two weeks, with maximum temperatures hovering around 45-46C for days at a stretch and even climbing up to 50C in some areas. However, India's weather department says that temperatures are likely to fall in the coming days due to the onset on the monsoon. Several regions are experiencing severe water and electricity shortages due to a rise in power consumption. Videos from capital Delhi show people jostling for water from water tankers. Many parts of the capital are also experiencing frequent power cuts. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

bbc,"India's Modi could win third term, polls predict",1 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgllg541xmxo,"India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to win a third consecutive term in office, exit polls suggest. Analysts warn the polls, released by various news agencies, have often been wrong in the past and are not impartial. However, they have placed Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as the frontrunner in the general election. The BJP, the main opposition Congress party and regional rivals battled it out in a fierce campaign over seven phases of polling. Results will be announced on 4 June. A party or coalition needs 272 seats in parliament to form a government. The BJP led-coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), will cross this target - according to exit polls, which forecast it being close to taking about two-thirds of the seats. In his first comments after voting ended, Mr Modi claimed victory without referring to the exit polls. ""I can say with confidence that the people of India have voted in record numbers to re-elect the NDA government,"" he wrote on X, without providing evidence of his claim. Prime Minister Modi came into this election with resounding popularity, but his main rival - the leader of the Indian National Congress, Rahul Gandhi - and a coalition of opposition parties gathered significant momentum through the course of the lengthy election campaign. Now an aggregate of six exit polls forecasts big wins for the BJP-led NDA, but such surveys are not always reliable. Though the individual numbers vary, they predict that the NDA will get between 355 and 380 seats. The INDIA bloc is expected to get between 125 and 165 seats, according to the Reuters news agency. On its own, the BJP may win about 327 seats, not quite meeting its 370-seat target. India is the world's most populous country, with 1.4 billion people, and holding a nationwide election is nothing short of a Herculean task. Some 969 million citizens were eligible to cast their ballot, which is equal to the populations of the US, Russia, Japan, Britain, Brazil, France and Belgium. Polling for the election, which concluded just hours ago, began on 19 April. The season was marked by fiery speeches by politicians (some of them controversial), numerous rallies, diatribes, jibes and propaganda as political parties looked to outsmart their opponents - on the ground and even online. And there wasn't a dearth of headline-making incidents. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's arrest in a liquor policy case days before polling began drew sharp criticism from opposition leaders and even sections of the media. Opposition leaders accused the BJP government of trying to silence rivals and deny them a level playing field - which the BJP denies. A court granted Mr Kejriwal bail on 10 May to campaign for the elections. However, he has to return to jail on 2 June. The election was also overshadowed by reports of politicians and party workers tampering with voting machines, Muslims being denied their right to vote in some areas and parties flouting the Model Code of Conduct - guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India (ECI) to ensure free and fair elections. Opposition leaders also accused the commission of not acting on their complaints against the BJP - an allegation the ECI has denied. The inauguration of the Ram temple, which was one of the BJP's biggest poll promises this election, and the government's welfare schemes are expected to benefit the ruling party. But the high unemployment rate and price rises, especially of food and fuel, were also at the top of many voters' minds. The election also came amid allegations from the opposition, activists and global rights organisations that Indian democracy is under threat. It is an issue that may have influenced the way people cast their votes. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Ten fatalities were recorded at the government hospital in Odisha's Rourkela region on Thursday, authorities told Reuters news agency. Heat-stroke related deaths have also been reported from the states of Bihar, Rajasthan and Jharkhand and the national capital, Delhi. The searing heat comes as India is holding its general election, the results of which will be declared on 4 June. Mahendra Kumar, district magistrate of Bhojpur district in Bihar told the Times of India newspaper that three election officers and a policeman had died in the city on Thursday due to heat stroke. ""It was the hottest day, and despite having medical facilities at all centres, they collapsed. One home guard [volunteer policeman] became unconscious where he was staying,""  Mr Kumar said, adding that the man died in the hospital while being treated by doctors. He also said that around 30-40 people had been admitted to the same hospital on Thursday due to heat-related ailments. Hospitals in the region are recording a rise in admissions due to heat-related ailments. On Thursday, a labourer admitted with a heat stroke died while receiving treatment at a hospital in Delhi. India's National Centre for Disease Control calls heat strokes a ""life-threatening"" condition with a mortality rate of 40 to 64%. The heat in northern, central and parts of western India has been unrelenting for the past two weeks, with maximum temperatures hovering around 45-46C for days at a stretch and even climbing up to 50C in some areas. Several regions are experiencing severe water and electricity shortages due to a rise in consumption. The soaring temperatures have led to a surge in fires across India and  authorities are employing drones to monitor forest fires in Jammu and Kashmir. In the past week, capital Delhi and surrounding regions experienced record-breaking temperatures nearing 50C. Videos of residents in Delhi jostling for water from water tankers have been widely shared on social media. Many parts of the capital are also experiencing frequent power cuts. Officials are still investigating whether the recorded temperature of 52.9C in the Mungeshpur area on Wednesday was a result of a sensor malfunction at the nearby weather station. India saw a 55% rise in deaths due to extreme heat between 2000-2004 and 2017-2021, a study published in the medical journal, The Lancet, found. Exposure to heat also caused a loss of 167.2 billion potential labour hours among Indians in 2021, the study noted. While many parts of the country have regularly experienced heatwaves in summer, experts have said these are now becoming longer, more intense and frequent. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

bbc,India MP arrested in sex-abuse case upon return to country,31 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clkkzx1zyejo,"Police in India have arrested a lawmaker who fled the country after being accused of sexually abusing several women. Prajwal Revanna, who left India on 27 April, was arrested on his arrival from Germany in the southern city of Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) early on Friday. Mr Revanna has denied all the allegations against him. The 33-year-old MP belongs to the Janata Dal (Secular) party, which is an ally of PM Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party. Mr Revanna, who belongs to an influential political family, is seeking re-election from the Hassan constituency in the southern state of Karnataka. But shortly before voting in Hassan, thousands of USB sticks with videos of the MP allegedly abusing women circulated in Karnataka, sparking outrage. Mr Revanna did not comment on the videos, but an official from his office said that the videos had been doctored. He fled the country shortly after voting ended in his constituency. Reports say the police have registered three cases of sexual assault against the MP so far. A special police team set up by Karnataka Chief Minister K Siddaramaiah is investigating the cases. On 18 May, a special court had issued an arrest warrant against Mr Revanna, following an application moved by the special investigation team (SIT). Days before he was arrested, Mr Revanna had applied for anticipatory bail but a court on Thursday rejected his plea. After remaining missing for several weeks, Mr Revanna had released a video on 27 May in which he said that he would appear before the SIT on Friday. The video came out shortly after his grandfather, former Indian prime minister HD Deve Gowda, asked him to return to India and face the investigation. Mr Revanna's father, HD Revanna and uncle HD Kumaraswamy are both influential legislators in the Karnataka state assembly. HD Revanna is also accused of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation in a police complaint lodged by a former employee of the family. He was held for six days but freed on bail last month. He has also denied the allegations, calling them a political conspiracy. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

bbc,The Indian women trumpeting their caste on Instagram,31 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrrq9e2pelo,"Young women in small towns and villages across India are proudly trumpeting their caste identities on Instagram, making it the latest battleground for caste politics. The BBC tracked 100 accounts and spoke to a dozen such influencers across the caste divide to understand what's driving the trend. The camera focuses on a woman in a black dress. She is pointing a rifle at the sky with her hand on the trigger. ""Who are you?"" asks an accompanying voiceover. ""We are Brahmins,"" a voice responds. The woman smiles, and the sound of two gunshots is heard. This is just one of hundreds of Instagram Reels made by Shivi Dikshit, a 24-year-old from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh who shares short videos about her Brahmin caste with her 150,000 followers on Instagram. Hinduism's deeply hierarchical caste system, which dates back at least 3,000 years, puts Brahmins or priests at the top and Dalits (formerly untouchables) at the bottom. Caste-based discrimination has been illegal in India for decades, but the country's 200 million Dalits continue to find themselves among the most marginalised citizens. Despite reforms, caste also remains a strong marker of identity in everyday conversations in many parts of the country. In the videos, which are shot at home and have more than a million views, Ms Dikshit talks about the ""superiority"" of Brahmins as she pours scorn on the notion of inter-caste relations and rejects affirmative policies aimed at empowering Dalits. ""Brahmins have a cultural upbringing [unlike other caste groups]. Everyone in my family is a practising priest. I want to propagate the values we practice and dispel myths about my community,"" she tells me while sitting on the terrace of her family-owned temple in the northern town of Meerut. Ms Dikshit is among the thousands of Indian women who are using Instagram to talk about their caste in new and imaginative ways. Most of them are from small towns and villages - unusual in a country where, unlike men, very few women speak publicly about their religious and caste identities. But access to social media, they say, has given them a platform to freely express themselves and challenge patriarchal controls. A study done by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) between 2014 and 2019 notes there has been a ""democratisation of the social media space"" in India, especially among the ""less educated and those living in rural areas"". And it's not just women from privileged castes - the strident views of those like Ms Dikshit have met a fightback from the Dalit community. Seemi Milind Jadhav, a 22-year-old beautician, goes by the name Bhimachi Sherni on Instagram. It's a reference to Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, a Dalit icon and the architect of India's constitution, while Sherni means lioness in Urdu. ""I look upon Ambedkar as a father figure. So, I am my father's lioness,"" she says. Ms Jadhav, who lives on the outskirts of India's financial capital Mumbai, says she began making Reels after coming across ""myths and disinformation being spread by upper-caste handles on Instagram"". ""I started educating myself about Ambedkar's teachings and caste politics, slowly I found a whole community of like-minded Dalits online,"" she told me. ""We now brainstorm and come up with our own Reels in response."" Most of the women the BBC spoke to said they made their online debut on the Chinese app TikTok and moved to Instagram after India banned it in 2020. The content they share is wide-ranging, but recurring themes include descriptions of ""the ideal"" Brahmin or Dalit man and a strong rejection of inter-caste marriages. These opinions can seem contrarian to a modern image of India - but data shows it's not uncommon. A Pew Research Center survey in 2019-2020 had more than 60% of respondents say it was important to stop both men and women in their community from marrying into other castes. These influencers also highlight the fault lines in a country marked by religious and social divisions. Brahmin women speak of uniting Brahmins and the Hindu community to contribute ""to the building of the Hindu nation"". But Dalit women like Ms Jadhav oppose the idea. They say if that happens, the strides the community has made in accessing education, employment and a life of dignity will be halted, pushing Dalits back to the margins. Hilal Ahmed, an assistant professor at CSDS, says the trend shows how women are rejecting popular assumptions that they are not interested in politics. ""Women are seen as bearers of culture and tradition that are derived from caste and religion,"" he explains. ""It is not surprising that now that they have a medium to express themselves, they want to own those identities and share their opinion about them."" But he adds that in the name of pride, these women are often perpetuating existing social divides. ""It's a paradox. They assert a sense of victimhood that their communities are under threat while also claiming that they don't fear anyone."" Some of the content shared is also provocative, with Reels bordering on hate speech and violence. The BBC contacted Meta about a few such videos, following which the company took them down from the platform. A Meta spokesperson said the company's community standards prohibit content targeting a person or group of people on the basis of their caste which is ""a protected characteristic"". ""Any content that threatens or incites violence is also prohibited,"" the spokesperson added. The women, however, dismiss allegations of casteism and violence and claim they are only trying to unite their community. Samiksha Sharma, who describes herself as Brahmin on Instagram, says she is often accused of ""dividing people"" and receives hostile comments ""However, I don't see it that way,"" the 24-year-old adds. ""I take inspiration from other Brahmin handles and promote our community."" In a country where millions of young adult women cannot even own a mobile phone without their parents' permission, Ms Jadhav says the platform allows her to navigate patriarchy through technology. When she first began making Reels in 2019, she did not tell her parents, recording them secretly at a salon where she worked to support her family. But she says the solidarities she built with women online gave her the courage to tell them the truth and assert her identity. ""They were shocked but proud that I was doing this for the community. So now I don't need to hide."" Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.

bbc,Absconding India MP to return to face sex abuse cases,29 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx99gkpwgq8o,"An Indian lawmaker who fled the country after being accused of sexual assault is set to return this week, more than a month after thousands of USB sticks with videos of the alleged abuse were circulated in his home state. Prajwal Revanna, an MP from Hassan district in Karnataka who is seeking re-election, had left India on 27 April using his diplomatic passport after the videos went viral. This week, he posted a video from an undisclosed location, saying he would return to India on 31 May to appear before a police team investigating the charges. He has denied the allegations of rape and sexual abuse, terming them a “political conspiracy”. Mr Revanna belongs to an influential political family - he is the grandson of former Indian prime minister HD Deve Gowda, who is the leader of the state's politically powerful Vokkaliga community. His Janata Dal (Secular), or JD (S) party, is an ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Prajwal Revanna's father HD Revanna and uncle HD Kumaraswamy are both influential legislators in the Karnataka state assembly. HD Revanna is also accused of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation in the police complaint lodged by a former employee of the family. He was arrested for six days but freed on bail last month. He has also denied the allegations, calling them a political conspiracy. In the past month while Mr Revanna was absent, fear and disquiet have gripped Hassan, which has been a stronghold of his family for decades. “It is too embarrassing to speak about what happened here,” a young shopkeeper in the district told the BBC. Roopa Hassan, a women's rights activist working in the state, says a lot of families have left the district over the past month. ""Many haven't come out of their houses for weeks,"" she said. The allegations against Mr Revanna first came to light in June last year, but he obtained a court order preventing media from reporting what was described as ""morphed videos"". But five days before the 26 April election in Hassan, thousands of pen drives were circulated in public places such as bus stands and parks. They contained 2,960 clips, which reports say were shot by Mr Revanna himself, and showed the faces of the women. On 28 April, one of the survivors lodged a police complaint, accusing Mr Revanna of raping her between 1 January 2021 and 25 April 2024 in his official government bungalow. She alleged that the politician had recorded the assault on his phone and used it to blackmail her and that he threatened her and her husband with a gun if she did not ""obey"" him. Mr Revanna did not address any of these direct allegations in his video. The couple, who said they had been “loyal” JD(S) party workers for decades, have alleged that they were forced to leave Hassan since their police complaint. The state government formed a special investigation team to look into the charges against Mr Revanna after another woman approached the women’s commission with similar accusations. Since then, police have received two more complaints of rape against the MP. On 1 May, Mr Revanna's lawyer told the SIT that he would not be able to participate in the inquiry since he was not in the country. In a social media post the same day, Mr Revanna also sought a week’s time to appear before investigators, saying that the “truth will prevail soon”. But he didn't return to India in a week. In May, the state government wrote to the federal foreign ministry twice, asking it to cancel Mr Revanna’s diplomatic passport. Foreign Minister S Jaishankar responded saying the request had been received late and that action was initiated on the request on 23 May. The case has sparked a political storm in Karnataka with the state's governing Congress party and the opposition blaming each other over who should have taken action against Mr Revanna when the videos surfaced. A state minister accused the BJP of fielding Mr Revanna for the election despite knowing that ""hundreds of women had been abused by the candidate"". Some reports said that the BJP’s state leaders had warned party leaders in Delhi about Mr Revanna's alleged misconduct. Meanwhile in Hassan, people remain reluctant to discuss the case, with two female students called it “disgusting”. “Boys in our college are talking about it. But we feel repulsed and don't even want to listen to what happened,"" one of them said. ""People switch off their TV sets now because they only show this shameful episode,” a resident who did not want to be named said. “We are sick of this. This has given the district such a bad name."" Mr Gowda and Mr Kumaraswamy have distanced themselves from the controversy and made several public appeals for Prajwal Revanna to return to the country. Last week, Mr Kumaraswamy apologised to party workers on behalf of the family. ""Be assured that I shall do everything possible to fight for your cause,"" he said. But a senior JD(S) worker, who wanted to stay anonymous, told the BBC that party workers were “depressed and upset’’ over the allegations. “We were all like an extended family of Mr Deve Gowda,"" she said.

bbc,The Indian state holding the key to PM Modi's re-election,29 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqee449yl5lo,"As India votes to elect a new government, all eyes are on the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, commonly known by its initials UP. Spread over an area roughly the size of Britain, the state packs in nearly four times as many people. With an estimated 257 million people, it is India’s most populous state and would be the fifth largest in the world if it was an independent country after India, China, United States and Indonesia and ahead of Pakistan or Brazil. The state is among just three in India which are voting in all seven phases in the elections which are spread over 44 days. (Voting ends on 1 June and results will be announced on 4 June.) So, it’s no surprise that UP - which elects 80 MPs in the 543-member lower house of parliament (the Lok Sabha) - is considered key to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s re-election bid as he seeks to return for a third consecutive term. “It’s commonly said that ‘the way to Delhi is through UP’ and a party that does well in the state generally goes on to rule India,” says Sharat Pradhan, senior journalist in the state capital, Lucknow. “Eight of India’s former prime ministers,” he adds, “have represented the state and in 2014, when Mr Modi - originally from the western state of Gujarat – made his debut as an MP, he too chose UP.” Mr Modi held his seat in the ancient city of Varanasi in 2019 and aims to do so again this year. So, Mr Modi has been on a whirlwind tour of the state, doing roadshows and addressing rallies – sometimes up to seven in a single day – to convince voters to support his party. He’s set his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a goal of 370 seats - a party needs 272 to win. In 2014, BJP won 71 seats in the state and in 2019, it got 62. This time, party leaders say, they’re aiming for 70 plus – even all of its 80 seats. The maths, the opposition Congress party’s Gaurav Kapoor says, is simple – “a party that wins 70 seats here needs just 202 more to form a government”. Earlier this month, when Mr Modi arrived in the city to file his nomination, accompanied by the state’s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a saffron-robed Hindu monk-turned-politician, thousands of supporters gathered to cheer them on. A truck painted saffron – the colour associated with the BJP – and decorated with marigold flowers carried them as their cavalcade made its way through the narrow streets of the ancient city. Mr Modi waved and held up a replica of the lotus flower – his party symbol – as men and women dressed in saffron clothes and caps raised slogans in support. It’s not just the BJP that’s eyeing the state regarded as “the biggest prize” in Indian election. The Congress, which was dominant in the state for four decades until it was edged out by local parties in 1991, is fighting here in alliance with the regional Samajwadi Party (SP). The alliance has also claimed that “we are winning 79 seats and have a fight in one”. Counting of votes on 4 June is likely to show claims on both sides are exaggerated, but analysts point out that all the elections in the past 10 years in the state have gone in the BJP’s favour. And the upbeat mood at Mr Modi’s roadshow reflected that self-assurance. Most Varanasi residents in the crowd talked about the transformation their city has undergone in the past decade – the new highways that have been built, the expansion of the Kashi-Vishwanath temple and the spruced-up banks of the river Ganges. Watching Mr Modi’s procession from his shop along the route of the roadshow, Ambrish Mittal, a chemist, says “the city roads are cleaner and the long power cuts that plunged the city into darkness for hours are history”. But despite its political significance, UP remains among India's poorest states - though there have been some positive changes in the past few years. Government data shows that millions more now have electricity, access to toilets and are using clean fuel compared to five years ago. But UP still has the largest concentration of poor in the world – with 23% of its population recorded as multidimensionally poor even after tens of millions have been lifted out of poverty. The state also records tens of thousands of violent crimes against women every year and continues to make headlines for cases where the accused are politically influential men. And although these ills have plagued the state historically, opposition parties have seized upon them and been raising them at their campaign rallies as the BJP has been in power nationally for a decade and also ruled UP for seven years now. The huge turnout at their meetings, opposition leaders say, reflects voter disenchantment with the BJP. “Until a few weeks back, election in the state had seemed like a one-sided contest with the odds stacked against us,” says Abhishek Yadav, a Samajwadi Party youth wing leader and a star campaigner for his party. But he feels that the opposition's campaign has gathered pace as unemployment and price rise have become main issues. The BJP claims that a lot of investment now started coming into the state and there’s been an industrial revival, but Gaurav Kapoor of the Congress says the government’s failure to establish any new industry or create jobs has alienated many voters. “Temples are the new industry for Mr Modi. Post-Covid, the only business that has progressed in the state are hotels and restaurants and other things to do with religious tourism. But the youth want jobs.” Ashwani Shahi of the BJP, however, blames opposition parties for everything that’s wrong with the state. “In 2017 when the BJP won UP, we inherited a state which was poor, had high rates of illiteracy and unemployment. We have started work to change that. “But It takes time to uplift people from poverty. I think By 2029, we’ll be able to take 90% people out of poverty.” Mr Shahi admits there is some anti-incumbency, but the BJP will still romp home in Uttar Pradesh – and the rest of India - because of Mr Modi.

bbc,Tackling water shortages with 'Star Wars' tech,28 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11nnwp646o,"When a severe drought hit the Indian city of Kozhikode, also known as Calicut, in 2016, residents including student Swapnil Shrivastav had access to a limited amount of water each day. “We were rationed to two buckets of water a day, which we collected from water tanks,” he says. While he says it’s not uncommon for water supply issues to impact parts of India, it was a tough month for Mr Shrivastav and others in the region. “It was a very humid area; it was unmanageable.” Mr Shrivastav was already interested in water scarcity having won a student competition in 2012 on imagining the future of water in cities, but the experience pushed him to explore solutions. “One element of inspiration was from Star Wars where there’s an air to water device. I thought why don’t we give it a try? It was more of a curiosity project.” Several years later, in 2019, that idea led him, Govinda Balaji and Venkatesh Raja to set up Uravu Labs, a Bangalore-based startup. Their system converts air to water using atmospheric water generators that contain a liquid desiccant, which absorbs moisture from the air. Using sunlight or renewable electricity they heat the desiccant to 65C which releases the moisture, which can then be condensed into drinking water. Mr Shrivastav says the whole process takes about 12 hours. Today each unit produces about 2,000 litres of drinking water. However, while his vision was to supply drinking water to communities facing water shortages, he says it wasn’t financially viable. “We realised the tech still needs more time to scale up and come down in cost,” says Mr Shrivastav. “Or someone should fund it, but we haven’t found the support in India.” Instead, they currently sell the water to 40 clients in the hospitality industry, who in turn use it to provide drinking water for customers. “We tried non-profit and CSR departments [corporate social responsibility]... but many companies shy away from tech. They thought it wouldn’t work. We had to shift to commercial consumption applications as they were ready to pay us and it’s a sustainability driver for them.” Water shortages are not new, but many countries, especially in the global south, are experiencing climate change-related intense drought and flooding that contaminates water sources. More than 50% of the global population – four billion people - experience water shortfalls at least once a month, while by 2025, 1.8 billion people are expected to be living in countries or regions with “absolute” water scarcity, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Could atmospheric water generation technology be the answer? Energy efficient – it can be powered by renewable sources – it’s one way of providing a fresh source of water without the need for traditional water infrastructure, making it an attractive option in remote locations. There appears to be a market for the technology. Valued at $3.4bn (£2.7bn) in 2022, the atmospheric water generation market is expected to be worth $13.5bn in 2032, according to a report by Global Market Insights. There are two main methods for atmospheric water generation. Firstly, there’s the cooling and condensation process which cools humid air to its dew point, causing water vapour to condense into liquid water. The second is a desiccant-based system which uses hygroscopic materials to absorb moisture from the air, then release it through a heating process, he says. Through her social enterprise Majik Water, co-founder and chief executive Beth Koigi manages about 40 atmospheric water generator units across arid and semi-arid regions across Kenya, using a cooling and condensation-based techniques to capture moisture from the air. Founded in 2017, Ms Koigi was inspired to start Majik Water after experiencing water scarcity for the first time during a drought when she was studying in Nairobi in 2016. While many visited a nearby river to fetch water for cooking, drinking and washing, Koigi says she couldn’t bring herself to drink the contaminated water. “It made me realise that you take for granted water as it’s always there.” She started looking for other water source ideas and set up a water filter company before developing an air-to-water system. Majik Water works with NGOs and humanitarian organisations, as well as being sold in stores. Majik's biggest unit produces 500 litres of water in 24 hours and is installed in schools and small communities. While there is demand for her company's system, Ms Koigi does not see it as a permanent solution. “Honestly, I feel like this is not the solution to water scarcity,” says Ms Koigi. “It’s a temporary solution… mostly because it’s not cheap."" Manufacturers are focused on making air-to-water generation systems more energy efficient, says Avinash Singh, associate director of research and consulting at Global Market Insights. “For instance, innovations in compressors, heat exchangers, and desiccants have improved the energy efficiency of such systems."" He adds that government support, subsidies, or environmental regulations could drive further adoption of the technology. One development which has helped the adoption of such water systems is the move to digital payments. Headquartered in Italy, Veragon has water production units across the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and South America. “When we originally started with off-grid communities, it was a cash-based society which wasn’t really viable… nowadays it’s being digitalised,” says Veragon global business director Stephen White. “For example, the majority of Cambodia is covered by 4G and Covid saw an explosion of e-wallets. There’s much better private infrastructure and partnership -  the government doesn’t have to be involved, and we sell water at much lower price.” He says all units will be moved to digital in the next few months. However, the prices of the units is not cheap. Veragon says its units, which use the cooling and condensing system, cost between $60,000 and $70,000. But Mr Shrivastav points that making water in situ has a cost advantage as water is quite heavy and not easy to transport around. Looking ahead, Uravu Labs is exploring how advancements in material science can improve the efficiency of desiccants, or how utilising a different material for absorbing more moisture from the air could make the process more effective. Mr Shrivastav says these advancements will also result in reducing the heat required from 60C to 40C. They are also hoping to run pilot projects involving installing its units in data centres in India and Singapore. Data centres generate a lot of heat which is usually lost, but Uravu plans to instead to use it create fresh water. “This process will result in up to 95% reduction in fresh water consumption [by the datacentre] as Uravu's system captures most of the waste heat and gives back cold water, thus very little freshwater is needed as a top-up,” says Mr Shrivastav.

bbc,At least 16 dead as cyclone hits Bangladesh and India,27 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvv8q10vxvo,"At least 16 people have died after a cyclone crashed into coastal parts of India and southern Bangladesh. The region was hit by strong gales of 110km/h, torrential rain and tidal surges that have left low-lying areas flooded. Nearly a million people were evacuated as Cyclone Remal made landfall on Sunday evening. According to local authorities, approximately 8.4 million people lived in the cyclone's path, including 3.6 million children. The storm passed through the Bangladeshi port of Mongla and the Sagar Islands of West Bengal, India, on Sunday, weakening the following day. Bangladesh's minister for disaster Mohibbur Rahman told AFP news agency at least 10 people were killed in the cyclone. Some died from drowning and some from being crushed beneath their collapsed houses. ""A total of 3.75 million people have been affected... 35,483 homes were destroyed by the cyclone, and another 115,992 homes were damaged,"" Mr Rahman said. In neighbouring India, Sumit Gupta, a senior official in the West Bengal state government, confirmed the deaths of at least six civilians, including three who had been electrocuted. The cyclone destroyed thousands of homes, uprooted trees and damaged power lines. Strong winds blew the roofs off some tin and thatched houses, while mud huts were flattened. Ahead of Cyclone Remal, nearly three million people in Bangladesh saw their electricity shut off to avoid accidents, ministry officials said. Authorities in West Bengal quoted by Reuters news agency said at least 1,200 power poles had been uprooted. ""We have had no electricity since night, my mobile battery will run out any time,"" Rahat Raja from Bangladesh's coastal district of Satkhira told Reuters. A villager from Bagerhat in the country's south told the BBC the cyclone had created food shortages. ""There are no vehicles available on the road. There are shortages of food also. All shops are closed since yesterday,” Mohammed Ali said. Among the country's affected areas is Cox's Bazar in the southeast, where camps housing the nearly a million Rohingya refugees are at risk from landslides and flooding due to their flimsy temporary shelters. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) in the Asia Pacific region said they warned people in the camps, and had trained volunteers on standby, ready to relocate people living in ""high-risk areas"". Save the Children said it had sent four emergency response teams to the country's affected areas, including a medical team, to support recovery. The charity's country director Shumon Sengupta said the cyclone ""shows yet again how vulnerable Bangladesh is to extreme weather events"". Bangladesh is one of the world's most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change, suffering extremes from heatwaves to flooding. Cyclone Remal has been moving across the Bay of Bengal over the past few days, allowing authorities in both countries to prepare for its arrival. In Kolkata, the capital of India's West Bengal state, more than 50 flights were cancelled on Sunday. Flights have since resumed. In May 2023, the Bay of Bengal was hit by the region's most powerful cyclone in more than a decade, affecting thousands in Bangladesh and Myanmar. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

bbc,"Delhi hospital where babies died lacked licence, fire exits",27 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp33vmn3d8eo,"A hospital in Indian capital Delhi where seven babies died in a fire was operating without a valid licence, police said. The fire occurred on Saturday, leading to the arrests of the hospital owner and the doctor on duty. An investigation has found that the hospital also did not have fire extinguishers or an emergency exit. The tragedy took place hours after a fire broke out in a gaming arcade in Gujarat state's Rajkot city, killing 27 people.  Fires often break out in residential and commercial buildings in India due to a lax enforcement of safety norms. Saturday's tragedy, where a blaze engulfed the hospital in Delhi's Vivek Vihar neighbourhood, has horrified and angered people. Police commissioner Shahdara Surendra Chaudhary told ANI news agency that the hospital's NOC (No Objection Certificate) had expired on 31 March. A fire NOC - which certifies that a building meets fire safety standards - is required for hospital buildings that have a height of more than 15m (49ft). Mr. Chaudhary added that the hospital was permitted only five beds but had installed 10. At the time of the fire, 12 newborn babies were at the hospital. Five of them are now being treated at another hospital. Police have arrested Dr Naveen Kichi, director of the hospital and a doctor named Akash (the police shared only one name) in connection with the fire. They have been charged with culpable homicide. Dr Akash, who was on duty at the time of the incident, was not qualified to treat newborn babies in need of intensive care, police said. The Delhi government has ordered a magisterial inquiry. Dramatic visuals of fire engulfing the building on Saturday circulated on social media. The director of Delhi's fire department, Atul Garg, told the Press Trust of India news agency that the fire had spread due to a blast in an oxygen cylinder. Media reports say that the police is also investigating the possibility of the hospital running an illegal oxygen cylinder filling racket after locals reported suspicious activities. Officials also said rescue efforts were slowed by limited access to the building, which has a single staircase and no fire escape. Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the tragedy was ""heartbreaking"". ""The causes of the incident are being investigated and whoever is responsible for this negligence will not be spared,"" Mr Kejriwal said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi described it as ""heart-rending."" He has announced an ex gratia of 200,000 rupees ($2407; £1889) to the family members of each of the deceased and 50,000 rupees each to those injured. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

bbc,LGBTQ Indians are more accepted than ever - but politics hasn't caught up,27 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68933715,"Madhu Bai says she is like a rainbow. She rose from a storm, fleetingly spread joy and then returned to the sky. The 44-year-old made history in 2015 when she became the first trans person to be elected a mayor in India. She won in Raigarh, a small town in the central state of Chhattisgarh. But when her term ended in 2020, Madhu returned to her old life without a pension or government benefits. She dances and sings with other hijras, or trans women, at weddings and birth ceremonies - a common livelihood in India's transgender community. Madhu has no intention of re-joining politics. She says she is tired and thinks it's too polarised. ""I fought, won and worked for the people. Now I want to live for myself."" Madhu's short but successful political foray in India is a rarity in a field where the LGBTQ community is still heavily underrepresented. It's perplexing, activists say, in a democracy where acceptance of sexual and gender diversity has been on the rise and the community has seen many wins. In 2014, the Supreme Court officially recognised transgender people and their rights to welfare and other government benefits. Four years later, it scrapped a colonial-era ban on gay sex. Over half of Indian adults now believe same-sex marriage should be legal, according to a Pew survey. But LGBTQ Indians cannot only rely on the courts for change, as a ruling from the top court to not legalise same-sex unions demonstrated last year. Judges declared that changing the law was a matter for politicians, not the justice system. Campaigners say that LGBTQ politicians are the best advocates for their community. Yet in this year's general election, no major political party has fielded a single openly LGBTQ candidate. ""Queer people have been left out of conversations, told politics is not an avenue for them for so long,"" says Anish Gawande, a writer and founder of Pink List India, the country's first archive of politicians supporting LGBTQ+ rights. ""They never got the chance to build the necessary structures to advocate their demands."" No-one knows this better than Madhu. She says overcoming the ridicule and contempt of her opponents was more challenging than wooing voters, who connected with her instantly. After going door-to-door with her friends for days, asking for money to fund the campaign, she struggled to get a party ticket. Indian elections are expensive, and contesting independently without political funding is costlier. But she had no option after the two main political parties rejected her. When she won, she thought leaders would take her seriously. They didn't. At her first meeting, she says, members of several parties walked out. She alleges that a local leader threatened to slap her because he found her dance videos offensive. There were also days, in the beginning, when Madhu said she felt unsure whether she could use the women's washroom around party workers. ""People loved me and my work, but rivals hated my guts,"" she says. ""Behind the ridicule and abuse, I know they were all thinking the same thing: 'How could a hijra be the mayor?'"" The only official data on India's LGBTQ population is the government estimate: 2.5 million. But survey estimates suggest the true figure could be over 135 million. Campaigners say things have changed since Madhu won her seat. Today, more Indians know someone who is LGBTQ than they did a few years ago. Even some politicians, who were once wary of the subject, are becoming allies and promising more rights. ""Political parties in India are slowly peeping out of the closet and talking more prominently about LGBTQ rights,"" says Harish Iyer, one of India's first openly gay persons to be involved with a political party. There's also a growing momentum among the youth, who, Mr Iyer says, want to ""do away with homophobia once and for all"". This year's election campaign comes months after the Supreme Court decided to not legalise same-sex unions. Three opposition parties have promised to recognise same-sex couples legally, but the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - which polls suggest is likely to win a historic third term - has not. Despite this, Mr Gawande insists that LGBTQ rights are a current that Indian politics can no longer dismiss. The community's social and cultural capital is ""far in excess of its numerical strength"", he says. He expects the near future to bring wins on recognising relationships, affirmative action for trans people and access to healthcare. Some of these fights might not grab headlines - especially those affecting poorer people, who are at the sharp end of exclusion from jobs, education and political opportunities. ""LGBTQ struggles need to be seen through the lens of caste privilege,"" says Grace Banu, a Dalit (formerly untouchable) trans woman activist from the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Born in a poor family, she says she first faced discrimination because of her caste, and then over her gender. When she came out at the age of 14, her school barred her from taking classes and made her sit under a tree as punishment. When she resisted, her parents put her in a psychiatric hospital to ""cure her illness"". ""I would tell myself that this cannot be my destiny,"" she says. ""One day, I ran away to make my own fate."" Today, Ms Banu is a software engineer, the first trans woman with an engineering degree in her state, and considers herself a mother to 12 trans women. She lives in Chennai with a clan of three trans women, all of whom are also involved in the anti-caste and trans rights movement. Sprawled in the living room, they talk passionately about their lives, the conversations swerving across topics. One moment they are discussing their next court battle and the next minute they are wondering what to eat for lunch. ""The transgender, or the LGBTQ identity, is not a monolith,"" says Ms Banu, while her friends busy themselves in the kitchen, the clatter of plates occasionally interrupting the afternoon stillness. The 44-year-old recently petitioned an Indian court seeking ""horizontal reservations"", or separate quotas for transgender people in government jobs, within the existing quotas for historically disadvantaged communities. Ms Banu stresses that being transgender varies vastly across caste and class lines. Her fight, she says, focuses on the most marginalised. At the other end of Chennai, in an upscale apartment along the sea, lives Apsara Reddy, a trans woman and spokesperson of AIADMK, one of Tamil Nadu's main political parties. A former journalist with degrees from Australia and the UK, Ms Reddy's is a life of luxury: she drives a shiny silver Jaguar, collects art and wears the finest of silk saris. Ms Reddy acknowledges her privilege, but says: ""In politics, you need to look at the larger picture. You can't just be the voice of your own community."" Ms Reddy hasn't contested in an election but if she does, she doesn't want to be typecast ""as an LGBTQ flagbearer"" of her party. ""If you want to judge me, do it on the basis of my potential as a policy-maker, not my gender identity."" Activists say few in the LGBTQ community are able to come out like Ms Reddy, let alone conceive a life in politics. Mr Gawande suggests that for a long time, the community was never a political priority. The battle for equality taking place in the courts made it difficult for them to build relationships with other marginalised communities under a broader fight for equality, he says. Now he wants the community to focus on grassroots political activism, which he believes will raise the profile of LGBTQ issues. Mr Iyer, however, believes the ball is now in the court of the country's leaders. ""We are your friends, your family, customers, beneficiaries; we are everywhere but you haven't looked for us. If you call us, we will come to you, and that's what we expect from political parties."" Back in Raigarh, Madhu says it gets hard to get by sometimes, without a fixed pay. But given the life she's had, she's not constrained by what may lie ahead. ""Whatever it is, it's definitely not politics,"" she says, her jaunty sing-song voice soaring into a laugh. But she hopes others from the community seek political opportunities, so that queer people are no longer seen as oddities. ""Who knows, maybe then the country will see a rainbow again.""

bbc,Newborn babies die after fire at Delhi hospital,26 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c722zv2r64do,"At least six newborn babies have died following a fire at a hospital in Delhi, according to police. The blaze broke out late on Saturday evening at a hospital in the Indian capital's Vivek Vihar region. There were 12 babies in the unit, senior police officer Surendra Choudhary said. Another had died before the fire began. Authorities said legal action would be taken against the owner of the hospital, who had fled. Dramatic pictures on social media show several bursts of fire engulfing the building. Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the fire was ""heartbreaking"". ""The causes of the incident are being investigated and whoever is responsible for this negligence will not be spared,"" Mr Kejriwal said. The director of Delhi's fire department, Atul Garg, told the Press Trust of India news agency that 14 fire trucks had been sent to fight the blaze. ""The fire spread too fast due to a blast in an oxygen cylinder,"" he said. Officials said rescue efforts were slowed by limited access to the building, which has a single staircase and no fire escape. The hospital is squeezed between residential houses. It is not clear yet whether it followed all safety regulations, nor what initially caused the fire. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on X: ""The fire tragedy at a hospital in Delhi is heart-rending."" Earlier on Saturday, a ""massive fire"" broke out at a games arcade in Rajkot, in the western state of Gujarat. At least 27 people perished in that blaze, local officials said. Many of the victims are believed to be children. Families of the deceased are awaiting the results of DNA testing before the bodies can be handed over. Investigators are probing whether sparks from a welding machine ignited the blaze, according to local media. CCTV footage reportedly showed a welding machine being operated above piles of flammable material, according to The Indian Express newspaper, which cited a government official. A short circuit was previously believed to have been responsible for the blaze. Within a matter of hours following the fire breaking out, the two-storey building had been destroyed. When the BBC’s team reached the location, all that was visible was scrap metal and burnt debris. Authorities continued searching for further bodies in the rubble on Sunday. Fires are not uncommon in Indian cities as building bylaws are often flouted, residential and commercial areas not clearly segregated and enforcement of safety regulations can be lax. In 2019, a large fire swept through a bag factory in the capital, killing 43 workers. Additional reporting by Roxy Gagdekar Chhara, BBC Gujarati Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

bbc,Fighting for votes in 'the world's biggest data mine',26 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggqx4lwp6o,"They are the apps every Indian has on their phone - the one where you order your taxi, your food, find your next date. Innocuous, everyday, unremarkable to billions around the world. In India, these are also potentially the apps telling politicians everything they could possibly want to know about you - whether you want them to or not. A person's religion, mother tongue, ""the way you draft a message to your friend on social media"" have all become points of data politicians are keen to get their hands on, according to political strategist Rutwik Joshi, who is working with at least a dozen unnamed lawmakers on their re-election campaigns this election. And India’s combination of high smartphone take-up and lax regulations allowing private companies to sell data mean that most political parties have gathered ""the data to do everything"" - even down to knowing “what you are eating today"", he claims. The question is, why do they care? Put simply, says Mr Joshi, this level of information can predict the vote - ""and these predictions usually never go wrong"". But perhaps the bigger question is: why should you care? Microtargeting - described by Privacy International as the use of personal data “to target you with information and adverts to an unprecedented degree of personalisation” - is not new when it comes to elections. But it was in the wake of former US President Donald Trump’s 2016 win that it really hit the headlines. Back then, political consultancy Cambridge Analytica was credited with helping him to victory using data sold by Facebook to profile people and send them pro-Trump content. The firm denied these allegations but suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix. In 2022, Meta agreed to pay $725m (£600m) to settle a class action lawsuit over a data breach linked to Cambridge Analytica. It left people questioning whether the adverts they had seen had swayed their votes. Countries around the world were concerned enough about the impact on democracy that they swung into action. In India, a Cambridge Analytica affiliate said the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the opposition Congress party were its clients - which both denied. The country's then IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also warned of action against the company and Facebook if it misused data of Indian citizens. But there has since been little to stop micro-targeting of voters, data and security researcher Srinivas Kodali says. ""Every other election commission - like in the UK and Singapore - they all tried to understand the role of data and micro targeting in elections, they created certain forms of checks and balances, which is what normally an election commission should be doing, but we are not seeing that happen in India,"" he says. In India, the problem is compounded because it's ""a data society that was planned and built by the government without any safeguards"", Mr Kodali says. Indeed, there are some 650m smartphones users in the country - all boasting apps which could potentially share their data with a third party. But you don't necessarily need a smartphone to be vulnerable: one of the biggest holders of personal data is the government itself – and even it has been selling personal information to private companies. “The government built large databases of citizens, shared it with the private sector,” Mr Kodali says. This has all left citizens vulnerable to increased surveillance with little control over what information remains private, warns Prateek Waghre, executive director at the digital rights organisation Internet Freedom Foundation. Meanwhile, a data protection law passed by the government last year is yet to be implemented, experts say. The lack of rules is an issue, says Mr Kodali. ""It's like the wild, wild west - except on the internet."" And the result of all of this available data? As Mr Joshi puts it, India entered the election year as ""the biggest possible data mine in the world right now"". The thing is, no one is doing anything illegal, says Mr Joshi. "" I am not asking [the app], 'Give me mobile numbers of how many users you have and all the contact numbers of those users as well'. But I can ask, 'Are people eating veg or non-veg in your area?'"" he explains. And the apps are able to hand over that data – because the user gave them permission. ""For example, there are 10 different Indian apps in your mobile phone - you have given access to your contacts, to your gallery, to your mic, to your speakers, to your location, including the live location,"" Mr Joshi, whose company, Neeti I, has been using data to understand voter behaviour patterns in particular constituencies, says. And it is this data – along with data collected by party workers - which is then used to help decide who the candidate should be, where the candidate's wife should go to do a puja or aarti (offer prayers), what kind of speeches they should give - even what to wear. But does this level of targeting really work to change people’s mind? That remains unclear. But campaigners say on a basic level, it is a violation of people’s privacy. Extrapolating it further, having this level of detail could be used against people in the future. ""Just the fact that it is happening is problematic."" says Pratik Waghre, executive director at the digital rights organisation Internet Freedom Foundation. ""What we've seen is that there often doesn't seem to be a clear distinction between how data is being handled when someone is beneficiary of a government scheme and how that information is then being used by that particular political party which happens to be in power in a particular state or at a national level to then use that to micro target people with campaign messages."" The law also allows the government and government bodies to exempt themselves from vast sections on its discretion. It also has the powers to process, use or share this personal data with third parties. Mr Waghre fears future administrations could take it a step further. ""It can also be: ‘Let's collectively see who's supporting us and only give them the benefits’.” The use of such data also comes against the backdrop of India's larger misinformation problem, Mr Kodali says. And when combined with the amount of data on offer, it is a real problem. ""When you talk about artificial intelligence, targeted advertisements, micro targeting of voters - a lot of this falls under the idea of computational propaganda,"" he explains. ""Questions of this were raised heavily during the 2016 Trump election, where this election is considered as something that was influenced by foreign actors."" Mr Kodali says use of data and technology in election campaigns must be regulated just like money and ad spending currently is in order to keep elections fair. “If you have one or few set of political parties or groups with access to these technologies gaming elections, they may be free but they will stop looking fair,” he warns.

bbc,An Indian tale of love and sisterhood unfolds at Cannes,25 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl55dpd4d24o,"Indian filmmaker Payal Kapadia’s new film opens with street scenes of contemporary Mumbai. But All We Imagine as Light does not show us the rich, elite Mumbai of Bollywood stars and billionaire industrialists. Instead the filmmaker overlays the street images with voices of real immigrants of Mumbai who are the city’s heartbeat. This is Kapadia’s first narrative feature and it premiered on Thursday night in the main competition section of the Cannes Film Festival. The film received an eight-minute-long standing ovation. It's a significant achievement for the filmmaker, and also for India. This is the first time in 30 years that an Indian film has played in Cannes’ main competition section. Kapadia, 38, shares the limelight and the possibility of winning one of the festival’s prestigious awards with the likes of Francis Ford Coppola, Yorgos Lanthimos, Ali Abbasi, Jacques Audiard, and Jia Zhangke. Over the last four decades, Indian films have done fairly well on the world festival circuit. Mira Nair’s Salaam Bombay won the Camera d’Or at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival. A few days before the September 11 terrorist attacks, Nair’s 2001 classic Monsoon Wedding won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Director Ritesh Batra’s 2013 celebrated film The Lunchbox won the Grand Golden Rail Award at Cannes. And earlier this year director Shuchi Talati’s Girls Will Be Girls was awarded the Grand Jury and Audience prizes at the Sundance Film Festival. But the possibility of Palm d’Or or one of the other key Cannes awards has so far eluded India – the biggest film producing country in the world. This year, thanks to Kapadia’s beautifully realised and moving film, India stands a good chance of winning. Already the reviews have been full of high praise. The Guardian in its five-star review describes it as ""glorious… an absorbing story full of humanity"". The critic puts the film on a par with Satyajit Ray’s Mahanagar (The Big City) and Aranyer Din Ratri (Days and Nights in the Forest). And IndieWire in its A-grade review says Kapadia’s drama gives Mumbai a romantic gaze, as reflected in the way ""people occupy their space… whether alone or sharing"". Daughter of a well-known Indian artist Nalini Malani, Kapadia is very familiar with Mumbai, a multicultural and diverse city. ""It’s also a place where it’s a little bit easier for women to work as compared to many other places in the country,"" Kapadia says. ""I wanted to make a film about women who leave their homes to go to work somewhere else."" In All We Know as Light, Kapadia tracks the lives and struggles of two Indian nurses from the southern state of Kerala working in a hospital and living together in a small, congested apartment in Mumbai. One nurse – Prabha (Kani Kusruti, who played a supporting role in Girls Will Be Girls) - is married. Her husband now works in Germany and barely ever communicates with her. But then she suddenly receives a surprise gift from her husband – a rice cooker. She hugs the machine, as if it is the last sign of love in her marriage. The second nurse, Anu (Divya Prabha), is more adventurous and is carrying a secret romance with a young Muslim man Shiaz (a charming young actor, Hridhu Haroon) who is also from Kerala. Anu is Hindu and her family would not approve of her relationship with Shiaz. Mumbai’s congested environment with 22 million people clamouring for space and its harsh monsoon season does not allow Anu and Shiaz any privacy. But then suddenly a third nurse from their hospital – Parvaty (Chhaya Kadam, appearing in two films at Cannes this year) - decides to leave the city, forced out by the redevelopment of a slum for the city's rich. Could this be the chance to change the course of these characters' lives? The politics of negotiating space is no different than the struggles of students Kapadia captured in her last film – a documentary titled A Night of Knowing Nothing. The film premiered in the Directors’ Fortnight sidebar section of the Cannes festival in 2022. It won the L'Œil d'or ""Golden Eye"", the festival’s top documentary award. A Night of Knowing Nothing followed the 2015 students’ strike at the country’s prestigious government-run Film and Television Institute of India. Kapadia was part of the strike, and finally graduated from the institute with a degree in direction in 2018. In an interview in 2022 she described the documentary as a ""love letter to public universities and what they stand for – a place where ideally people of all strata of society can be together and enjoy freedom, both intellectual and physical"".

On Thursday, temperatures soared beyond 45C in many states and touched 48.8C in Rajasthan state's Barmer city. India's weather department has said that the heatwave is likely to continue till Wednesday. Several regions are facing water and electricity shortages due to spikes in power consumption.

bbc,Google to make Pixel phones and drones in India,24 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq55z7ynjyro,"Tech giant Google will soon begin making its Pixel smartphones in India, sources aware of the development have told the BBC. Google is set to manufacture the phones at an existing Foxconn facility in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The firm is also set to independently manufacture drones in the state. India has emerged as a key destination for global firms looking to diversify supply lines outside China in the midst of geopolitical tensions with the West. Last year, Google had announced plans to make Pixel smartphones in India, beginning with the Pixel 8. ""India is a priority market for Pixel smartphones, and we’re committed to bringing the best of our hardware and underlying built-in software capabilities to people across the country,"" it said in a blog post. On Friday, sources told the BBC that Alphabet's Google would make advanced versions of Pixel smartphones at the Tamil Nadu facility and that manufacturing would begin within this calendar year. Google and Foxconn have signed a contract to this end, the source said. Foxconn currently has two facilities in Tamil Nadu. At one of its facilities near Chennai city, it assembles Apple's iPhones.

bbc,Czech court okays extradition of US murder plot accused,23 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c06682y50veo,"The Czech Constitutional Court has rejected an Indian man's petition against his extradition to the US over an alleged plot to assassinate an American citizen in New York. Nikhil Gupta has been charged by the US government with trying to hire a hitman to assassinate US-based Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. Mr Gupta is in jail in Prague. A final decision on his extradition will be taken by the country's justice minister. The charges against Mr Gupta carry up to 20 years in prison. In November 2023, US prosecutors charged Mr Gupta with a plot to kill at least four Sikh separatists in North America, including Mr Pannun. They said that Mr Gupta had paid $100,000 (£79,000) in cash to a hitman to assassinate Mr Pannun, a dual US-Canadian citizen, in New York. But the hitman was actually an undercover federal agent, prosecutors said. Mr Gupta was allegedly directed by an Indian government official who was not named or charged in the indictment. India has designated Mr Pannun a terrorist, an allegation he denies, claiming to be an activist who believes in the movement for Khalistan, or a separate Sikh homeland. The White House said it raised the alleged assassination plot with India at the most senior level. India officials distanced themselves from the plot, saying such actions were against government policy. It also said it had formed a committee to investigate the allegations against Mr Gupta. In January, India's Supreme Court rejected a plea from Mr Gupta which asked it to aid his release and help him get a fair trial. The petition in India had claimed that Mr Gupta was arrested by ""self-claimed"" US federal agents and has not yet been given a fair trial. India's top court said it would not intervene in the case, adding that it was up to the government to take action. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

bbc,These elephants are dying on rail tracks - can AI save them?,21 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68988189,"The southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu is using an AI-based surveillance system to prevent elephant deaths on its railway tracks. Elephant deaths on and near the state's railway tracks are rising, with 36 fatalities recorded from train collisions in the past decade, according to official data. Eleven of these fatalities occurred on two railway tracks near Madukkarai, where the forest borders the state of Kerala. These tracks intersect with the elephants' migratory route to neighbouring forests. In 2021, the state's high court ordered the forest department and railways to prevent elephant deaths on these tracks. The forest department has now installed 12 towers along two of Madukkarai's rail tracks, each equipped with an AI camera capable of thermal and visible light imaging, along with live viewing. Project manager Ashish Rajput said that the AI system's cameras, comparable to those used by the Indian Army along the nation's borders, are programmed to even detect humans near railway lines. When elephants are detected within 100ft of the railway track, alerts are sent to forest and railway officials, who coordinate to slow down trains and guide the elephants away to prevent collisions. Four personnel continuously monitor the system in the control room near the railway track. The project, launched in February, has been executed at a cost of 72.4m rupees ($867,758; £683,976), says Supriya Sahu, secretary of the Tamil Nadu Forest Department. Previously, forest personnel conducted regular patrols along railway tracks to monitor elephant activity. Ms Sahu said this method had limitations, and ensuring complete elephant safety from accidents posed ""significant challenges"". Within months of its implementation, the AI system has detected nearly 400 instances of elephants approaching railway tracks and promptly reported to railway authorities, thus preventing potential accidents, she said. ""Alerts are sent if any animal, not just elephants, is found nearing the track,"" say Mr Manikandan, who works at the control room. This is not the first time AI is being used to protect wildlife in India. In December, India's federal railway ministry said it was implementing an AI-based surveillance system - called Gajraj - in elephant corridors across several states in the country. Under this project, officials are installing sensors using AI tech near railway tracks which send notifications to alert the railway administration and the forest department about the movement of the elephants, other animals, and humans to prevent accidents. In African countries like Gabon, Kenya and Botswana, AI camera systems are being used for elephant conservation efforts. Tamil Nadu has announced plans for its expansion of the new system to five other vulnerable areas in the state, including Coimbatore, Dharmapuri, Hosur, and Gudalur.

bbc,Delhi sizzles as temperatures cross 45C,20 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c888e0730zpo,"Northern India, including capital Delhi, is reeling under a fierce heatwave with temperatures soaring above 45C over the weekend. On Sunday, Najafgarh district in Delhi recorded a temperature of 47.8C, the highest in the country this season. The weather department has said the heat spell is likely to continue this week. The searing heat comes as India is holding its general election, the results of which will be declared on 4 June. Indian summers, which extend from March to September, are usually hot and humid. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has said the country is likely to experience longer and more intense heatwaves this year. On Saturday, temperatures crossed 45C in 10 locations in the National Capital Region (NCR), which encompasses Delhi and some districts from the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan. The IMD has predicted that maximum temperatures in Delhi and other northern cities are likely to hover around 45-46C over Monday and Tuesday. It has also predicted a fresh heat spell over parts of western and central India over the next few days. Many Indian states, reeling under the heatwave, are also going to the polls this week. On Monday, millions of voters will cast their votes in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar while Delhi will vote on 25 May. The elections are being held in seven phases from 19 April to 1 June. Many voters have expressed discomfort stepping out in the extreme heat. They say it's difficult standing in queues, especially for senior citizens. India's election authorities have extended voting timings and have asked people to protect themselves against the heat while going to vote. Summers have always been gruelling in many parts of India - especially in the northern and central regions.  While some people use air-conditioners and water coolers to keep themselves cool, others, especially in the more distant towns, have devised their own ways of coping with the heat - from keeping water cool in earthen jugs to taking drinks made with raw mango pulp to ward off heat strokes.

bbc,‘My body can’t take it’: Brutal nighttime temperatures give Delhi residents little respite from India’s searing heatwave,"Jun 22, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/21/india/india-delhi-nighttime-heatwave-climate-intl-hnk/index.html,"Nights are getting uncomfortably and dangerously hotter in India’s capital as people in the world’s most populous nation feel little respite from unrelenting temperatures. Northern India has endured a scorching summer — with one part of the capital of Delhi reaching the city’s highest temperature on record, 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 degrees Fahrenheit) earlier this month. But the stifling heat persists even after the blazing sun has set. The city is cooling down by only 8.5 degrees Celsius at night compared to a 12.2 degrees cooling down in urban outskirt areas, a report published by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) last month tracking urban heat stress in Delhi has found. The warmer nights deprive people of rest and recovery from long hours of exposure to oppressive heat, particularly for people without access to air conditioning. Bicycle rickshaw driver Sagar Mandal told CNN that he’s been getting fewer passengers because people opt for air-conditioned taxis over open-air transport. “My body can’t take it, but I have to keep cycling. We are used to physical labor, we aren’t complaining about that. But this heat is not normal, something has to change,” the 39-year-old, who pedals people around the city, said. “No one cares if we live or die, no matter who you vote for this is a problem no one can solve,” he said. Nikhil Kumar, an auto-rickshaw driver said his workdays are getting longer and tougher amid the heat. “It doesn’t get any better at night, even at night I’m sweating, it rained a little last night but look how hot it is today, there’s no relief,” the 26-year-old driver said. Hotter nights are a consequence of the climate crisis, scientists have warned, heightening the health hazards of heat stress. Studies have shown higher nighttime temperatures make it harder to fall asleep and reduce deep wave and REM (rapid eye movement), both critical to how well the body repairs and refreshes itself at night. In the United States, for example, nights are warming faster than days in most of country, the 2018 National Climate Assessment found. Mandal, the cycle-rickshaw driver said he has been sleeping on the roof of his home for some hope of cooler air but only for a couple of hours. “I barely sleep these days,” he said. Exposure to heat waves during pregnancy may be associated with adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, according to a 2019 study. Older adults may have higher heart rates and more physiological stress when sleeping in warmer temperatures. A 2008 Australian study even found deaths due to mental and behavioral disorders rose during heat waves, especially for older adults. Increasing nighttime heat is even more common in cities like Delhi because of the urban heat island effect, in which metro areas are significantly hotter than their surroundings. Areas with a lot of asphalt and dense concrete buildings absorb more of the sun’s heat than areas with ample parks, rivers and tree-lined streets. The hot days and nights are testing the limits of the country’s electricity grid and water supply, and the strain on resources is already making people sick. “We’ve been living in this neighborhood for 40 years, but we have never seen a summer like this,” said 60-year-old Kalyani Saha, a resident of the Lajpat Nagar neighborhood of the capital city. “There hasn’t been power for the last two hours, in the middle of the day that’s unbearable,” Saha told CNN, saying that power cuts also render their air-conditioning system useless. “We get water only once a day, and it’s scalding hot, unless you fill up a bucket and let it cool off all day before using it, you can’t bathe in this water,” she said. Saha also said her grandson has been ill for a week. “They’re small, they can’t cope with this, this is not a human level of heat,” she said. At least 40,000 cases of heat stroke have been reported in India since March, an official in the Ministry of Health told CNN Thursday, and at least 110 people have died across the country due to suspected heat stroke as well. Dr Ajay Chauhan, in charge of the first of its kind heat-stroke unit at Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohiya (RML) hospital says hotter nights mean increased stress on the bodies. “When a person has a heat stroke, things progress very quickly, so without early intervention the fatality rate of heat strokes is very high,” Chauhan said. Chauhan said people who work outdoors all day need time to cool down and recover but he concedes “that’s not been possible.” At least 11 people have died as a result of heat strokes at his hospital since May 29 and on Thursday alone over 20 new patients were admitted to the hospital for various heat-related illnesses. Over the past five decades, India has experienced more than 700 heat wave events claiming more than 17,000 lives, according to a 2021 study of extreme weather in the Weather and Climate Extremes journal. Delhi recorded the highest numbers of homeless deaths in the last five years during the 9-day stretch. Between June 11 and 19, Delhi saw 192 heatwave-related deaths among its homeless population, a record high compared with the same period in the last five years, according to a report from the NGO Centre for Health Development India. “Almost everyone living on the streets reported experiencing sleeplessness,” the report said, adding that they suffered from several heat-related ailments. Sarita Kumari has been sleeping on the streets of Delhi with her three children, and told CNN her three-year-old son has been running a high fever all week. “We do have a house but there’s a lot of us and when the power goes it gets suffocating,” Kumari said.",night getting uncomfortably dangerously hotter india capital people world populous nation feel little respite unrelenting temperature northern india endured scorching summer one part capital delhi reaching city highest temperature record degree celsius degree fahrenheit earlier month stifling heat persists even blazing sun set city cooling degree celsius night compared degree cooling urban outskirt area report published centre science environment cse last month tracking urban heat stress delhi found warmer night deprive people rest recovery long hour exposure oppressive heat particularly people without access air conditioning bicycle rickshaw driver sagar mandal told cnn he getting fewer passenger people opt airconditioned taxi openair transport body cant take keep cycling used physical labor arent complaining heat normal something change yearold pedal people around city said one care live die matter vote problem one solve said nikhil kumar autorickshaw driver said workday getting longer tougher amid heat doesnt get better night even night im sweating rained little last night look hot today there relief yearold driver said hotter night consequence climate crisis scientist warned heightening health hazard heat stress study shown higher nighttime temperature make harder fall asleep reduce deep wave rem rapid eye movement critical well body repair refreshes night united state example night warming faster day country national climate assessment found mandal cyclerickshaw driver said sleeping roof home hope cooler air couple hour barely sleep day said exposure heat wave pregnancy may associated adverse outcome preterm birth according study older adult may higher heart rate physiological stress sleeping warmer temperature australian study even found death due mental behavioral disorder rose heat wave especially older adult increasing nighttime heat even common city like delhi urban heat island effect metro area significantly hotter surroundings area lot asphalt dense concrete building absorb sun heat area ample park river treelined street hot day night testing limit country electricity grid water supply strain resource already making people sick weve living neighborhood year never seen summer like said yearold kalyani saha resident lajpat nagar neighborhood capital city hasnt power last two hour middle day thats unbearable saha told cnn saying power cut also render airconditioning system useless get water day scalding hot unless fill bucket let cool day using cant bathe water said saha also said grandson ill week theyre small cant cope human level heat said least case heat stroke reported india since march official ministry health told cnn thursday least people died across country due suspected heat stroke well dr ajay chauhan charge first kind heatstroke unit delhi ram manohar lohiya rml hospital say hotter night mean increased stress body person heat stroke thing progress quickly without early intervention fatality rate heat stroke high chauhan said chauhan said people work outdoors day need time cool recover concedes thats possible least people died result heat stroke hospital since may thursday alone new patient admitted hospital various heatrelated illness past five decade india experienced heat wave event claiming life according study extreme weather weather climate extreme journal delhi recorded highest number homeless death last five year day stretch june delhi saw heatwaverelated death among homeless population record high compared period last five year according report ngo centre health development india almost everyone living street reported experiencing sleeplessness report said adding suffered several heatrelated ailment sarita kumari sleeping street delhi three child told cnn threeyearold son running high fever week house there lot u power go get suffocating kumari said,-40.0,negative,2
bbc,"June 17, 2024 - Israel-Gaza news","Jun 18, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-06-17-24/index.html,"Our live coverage for the day has ended. Follow the latest Israel-Hamas war news or read through the updates below. US forces destroyed four Houthi militant radars and a surface sea drone in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen in the past 24 hours, US Central Command said. The US military also destroyed a Houthi drone over the Red Sea, according to a CENTCOM statement. “These actions were taken to protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for U.S., coalition, and merchant vessels,” it said. A UNICEF official said Monday that warnings about children dying in Gaza are falling on deaf ears. Speaking to CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, Elder said he has seen “so many children with amputations” and “children with head wounds, with terrible burns, not being able to get the medical attention because we’ve seen the systematic devastation.” “It’s just no place for children,” Elder said about the entire Gaza Strip. Israel has announced a “tactical pause” of military activity along a route in southern Gaza to allow aid to be distributed. Elder said that while “any pause in bombing anywhere on the Gaza Strip that will protect children is good news,” he said the “tactical pause” aimed at allowing more aid trucks into the enclave has not led to any improvements yet. Elder said the problem is larger than just the area that is under the pause and called for more crossings to be opened. Agencies also need to then be able to deliver the aid safely across Gaza, he said. At least nine people were arrested during an anti-government protest in Jerusalem on Monday night, according to a statement from an Israeli police spokesperson. Some were arrested on suspicion of attacking policemen and disruption, and four were arrested on suspicion of setting fire or trying to set fire, the statement said. Some officers were slightly injured, it said. “Following the fact that the protest turned into a disturbance and a violent riot, a police officer declared the protest illegal and ordered [protesters] to disperse from the place,” the statement said. Two protesters were lightly injured and taken to the hospital, according to Magen David Adom, Israel’s emergency services. Some context: Thousands of people gathered during anti-government protests on Azza Street in Jerusalem. Some attempted to break through police barriers from the legally designated protest area around the Israeli Knesset to attempt to get close to the residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, police said. Since October 7, many anti-government protests have taken place as Israelis have called for the Netanyahu government to finalize a deal that would allow for the return of all hostages being held in Gaza and for early elections to be held in Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s dissolution of the war cabinet does not change the Biden administration’s “fundamental assessment” of the war in Gaza, according to State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller. Miller would not comment specifically on the dissolution of the war cabinet, saying “ultimately, those decisions are decisions for the government of Israel and for the people of Israel.” Miller also would not offer his assessment on what the dissolution of the war cabinet might mean for US discussions on the ceasefire proposal, conversations around which continue with the governments of Israel, Qatar, and Egypt. He also said the US “very much” welcomed the announcement of a “tactical pause” by the Israel Defense Forces along a route in southern Gaza to allow for further distribution of aid, a decision that an Israeli official told CNN made Netanyahu unhappy when he first heard of it. An Israeli airstrike killed at least eight Palestinians east of Rafah on Monday, the European Hospital Media Unit told CNN. The “civilian volunteers” were securing commercial trucks in the area, it said. The hospital officials said it was in an Israeli airstrike, citing witnesses who arrived with the injured people and those who helped to pull the bodies from under the rubble. The area that was hit is designated for commercial trucks, the media unit said. The European Hospital also released the names of the people killed and said others were also injured. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment. Two Israeli hostage survivors who were held by militant groups in Gaza for weeks shared their horrific stories while in captivity, according to a news release from the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters on Monday. Danielle Aloni, who was held hostage for 49 days along with her five-year-old daughter Amelia, said they were taken into tunnels after being snatched following Hamas attack on Israel in October 7. She said they were afraid of many things: “that they would shoot us, that they would get tired of us, that they would lose patience as the days went on.” “One day, one of our guards came in armed with a weapon and sat between us — what does that mean? That they’re afraid of an IDF rescue operation? “she added. Aloni and Amelia were among the Israeli hostages released last November in a hostage for Palestinian prisoner exchange deal. “It’s very difficult to think about the day after, when everyone returns, because the long-awaited day isn’t coming,” she said. Hostage survivor Luis Har recounted his rescue after 129 days in captivity. Har was rescued in February in an early morning raid in which the Israeli military carried out airstrikes that local officials said killed around 100 people in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. “Suddenly, there was a huge explosion. I rolled towards the door and then they called out to me, “Luis, over here!” I crawled on all fours, and someone grabbed my head and leg and shouted, “Luis, IDF, IDF, we’ve come to take you home.” From that moment, all the worries and fears disappeared,” he said. Israel and Hamas are at war, after the Palestinian militant group launched a surprise cross-border attack from Gaza on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Monday claimed its military operations in Rafah have killed more than 500 Hamas militants since early May. In addition, the Israeli military said forces located and destroyed 230 tunnel shafts. CNN is unable to independently verify these claims. This comes as fierce fighting has been underway in Rafah. Meanwhile, the IDF announced a “tactical pause” of military activities along a road in southern Gaza that has been designated for humanitarian aid deliveries every day for 11 hours. Here’s what else to know: The war cabinet: In disbanding the cabinet, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may have avoided having to accede to National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir’s calls to join it, which could have further strained Israel’s relations with the US, or having to reject his demands, which could have angered the more extreme wing of Netanyahu’s coalition. Palestinian displacement: More than 1.3 million people are believed to have been displaced from Rafah to other parts of Gaza in about six weeks, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. The agency also said 193 of its staff have been killed since the war between Israel and Hamas began on October 7, calling Gaza “the most dangerous places in the world for aid workers.” Israeli settlements in occupied West Bank: Israel’s government says it is looking to “strengthen” Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank after several countries unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state. All of the proposals would be voted on at the next Security Cabinet meeting, the prime minister’s office said Sunday. More from Middle East: The Iran-backed Houthis, a militant group in Yemen, have launched more than 190 attacks on commercial shipping and US Navy assets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said on Monday. Separately, the IDF said it killed Hezbollah’s “key operative in the Rocket and Missile Department” in an airstrike in southern Lebanon on Monday. Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant approved the “tactical pause” of military activity along a specific route in southern Gaza to allow for the distribution of aid, according to an Israeli military spokesperson. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson was responding to a request from CNN asking who decided to institute the pause. He said COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for approving aid into Gaza, and the Southern Command would first make this kind of decision before it would go up the chain of command for approval, depending on the situation. When asked if this kind of decision would need approval from the Israeli government or cabinet, the spokesperson said, “this kind of decision does not necessarily need to be approved by the cabinet, and it was approved by the minister of defense.” Some background: According to an Israeli official, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was unhappy when he first heard of the “tactical pause.” According to the official who spoke to CNN on Sunday and requested anonymity, Netanyahu then contacted his military secretary and said this was unacceptable until he was assured the fighting in Rafah would continue. CNN’s Lauren Izso contributed reporting to this post. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Monday claimed its military operations in Rafah have killed more than 500 Hamas militants since early May. The IDF also said that hundreds of buildings in the southern Gaza city were rigged with explosives but without giving further details. In addition to that, the Israeli military’s forces located and destroyed 230 tunnel shafts including 100 in the Philadelphi Corridor, it said. “We have caused severe damage to Hamas’ Rafah Brigade. Of the 4 Rafah Battalions, 2 are currently at medium level of operational functioning and 2 are at a low level of operational functioning,” the IDF said in a statement. CNN is not able to independently confirm these claims made by the IDF. “We will continue our operations until we have decisively destroyed the Rafah Brigade,” the IDF added. This weekend: The fierce fighting that has been underway in Rafah continued over the weekend, with a civil defense official in Gaza telling CNN that heavy clashes were ongoing in neighborhoods in the western part of the city on Sunday On Saturday, eight IDF soldiers were killed near the city, one of the single deadliest incidents of the war for Israeli troops. The Iran-backed Houthis have launched more than 190 attacks on commercial shipping and US Navy assets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said on Monday. The Houthis, a militant group in Yemen, have launched attacks as recently as last week. On Wednesday the M/V Tutor, a bulk cargo carrier, was hit by a Houthi uncrewed surface vessel, resulting in the crew abandoning the ship and one civilian mariner going missing. On Thursday, another bulk cargo carrier the M/V Verbena was also struck in two missile attacks, seriously injuring at least one civilian mariner. The crew later abandoned the ship. Despite the ongoing attacks, however, Singh defended US efforts in the region as successful against the Houthis. More about the Houthis: The Houthis have launched dozens of missile and drone attacks directed at ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 attack. The Houthi attacks have forced some of the world’s biggest shipping and oil companies to suspend transit through one of the world’s most important maritime trade routes, which could potentially cause a shock to the global economy. The Houthis are believed to have been armed and trained by Iran, and there are fears that their attacks could escalate Israel’s war against Hamas into a wider regional conflict. CNN’s Christian Edwards contributed reporting to this post. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS) condemned Israel’s “heinous crimes” in the Gaza Strip on Monday, imploring the international community to implement Gaza-related UN Security Council resolutions and work toward a ceasefire. The Crown Prince also called on the international community to immediately recognize an independent state of Palestine based on “1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital,” which he said would “enable the brotherly Palestinian people to obtain their legitimate rights and to achieve comprehensive, just and lasting peace.” The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced a “tactical pause” of military activities along a road in southern Gaza that has been designated for humanitarian aid deliveries every day for 11 hours. The announcement comes as the strip’s population of more than 2 million grapples with humanitarian conditions that the United Nations has described as “unspeakable.” The “pause,” which the IDF announced Sunday but COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for approving aid into Gaza, said came into effect on Saturday, raised questions about what it means for the conflict and for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Human rights groups have described health concerns “beyond crisis levels” for Palestinians in the enclave, with over 75% of the population displaced, according to the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). Israel’s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies. The announcement also appeared to have deepened existing political rifts in the Israeli government, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unhappy when he first heard about it, according to one official. More about the “tactical pause:” It will take place every day from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. local time until further notice. The pause began Saturday, the IDF said, and is meant to allow trucks to move from the Kerem Shalom Crossing, the main entry point for incoming aid to southern Gaza, up the Salah al-Din Road and northwards. The IDF has designated a specific route for aid trucks to take, which starts from Kerem Shalom to Al Bayuk neighborhood and onto the European Hospital in Khan Younis. The route will be run in coordination with international organizations, the IDF said, as part of efforts to increase volumes of aid reaching Gaza. Read more about this development. Hezbollah’s “key operative in the Rocket and Missile Department” was killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon on Monday, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in a statement. The IDF said an Israeli warplane “struck and eliminated” Muhammad Mustafa Ayoub in the area of Selaa in southern Lebanon. “Over the past few months, Ayoub was involved in promoting terror attacks against Israeli civilians and communities, he promoted and planned terror attacks from southern Lebanon against the State of Israel,” the IDF statement added. Separately, Israeli fighter jets also struck Hezbollah’s “infrastructure and a military structure in the area of Meiss El Jabal in southern Lebanon,” the statement said. Hezbollah confirmed the death of Ayoup in a short statement on Tuesday, saying he “died as a martyr on the road to Jerusalem,” but without providing further details on the circumstances of his death. Why this matters: Israel and Hezbollah have been ramping up cross-border attacks after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border. With both sides trading fire for more than eight months, experts say Israel feels it can no longer ignore its northern front or delay taking action there. More than 1.3 million people are believed to have been displaced from Rafah to other parts of Gaza in a span of six weeks, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). “UNRWA estimates that 65,000 people are sheltering in Rafah,” it said on X. “Six weeks ago there were around 1.4 million.” UNRWA didn’t provide any detail as to where in Gaza those people had been displaced to. More on displaced Gazans: Last week, the Norwegian Refugee Council outlined in a report that almost a million people — half of Gaza’s population — have been displaced in the past month following Israel’s expanded military operations in Rafah. The report stated that it is becoming increasingly difficult for displaced people in Gaza to relocate, facing issues such as clogged streets, overcrowding, fuel shortages, and a sixfold surge in transport costs. It also warned of a rise in Hepatitis A cases, with the accumulation of solid waste becoming a “critical problem.” CNN’s Eyad Kourdi and Mohammad Al-Sawalhi contributed to this report. Israel’s government says it is looking to “strengthen” Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank after several countries unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state. In a statement issued on Sunday, the Prime Minister’s Office said all of the proposals for strengthening settlements in what Israel biblically refers to as Judea and Samaria would be voted on at the next Security Cabinet meeting. Norway, Ireland, Spain and Slovenia have each recognized an independent Palestinian state in recent weeks, a move motivated at least in part by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s open refusal to commit to a two-state solution. Israel’s Foreign Ministry said the move was a reward for terrorism and would strengthen Hamas. The statement also said Israel would look at what actions to take against the Palestinian Authority as it took actions against Israel in international bodies. Read more about Israel’s plans here. The Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari admitted the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) could’ve been clearer when it came to explaining its announcement of a “tactical pause” in military activity along a route in southern Gaza to allow aid distribution. Hagari said the military did not stop fighting against Hamas, and the decision was made by the military, not the Israeli government. “We are a democracy, and we are being ordered by the cabinet and our political echelon, the Ministry of Defense, and this is how the IDF works,” he explained in response to a question by Hancocks. “Our order was to make sure humanitarian aid was getting into Gaza. Israel is working according to the international law. We will keep on doing so, this is what the cabinet have ordered us to do.” On Sunday, the Government Media Office (GMO) in Gaza denied that a “tactical pause” was in effect in the southern Gaza Strip. US special envoy Amos Hochstein met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Monday, the Israeli PM’s office said in a statement. The statement didn’t detail what was discussed in the meeting but Hochstein’s visit happens as Washington is intensifying diplomatic efforts to try and prevent an escalation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. “The meeting was attended by Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Chief of Staff Rabbi Tzachi Braverman, the Prime Minister’s military secretary General Roman Goffman, political advisor Ofir Fleck and US Deputy Ambassador to Israel Stephanie Hallett,” the statement added. Hochstein also met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, where the pair discussed the necessity of securing the release of all hostages held by Hamas as well as Hezbollah’s attacks. “In their meeting, they discussed the relentless attacks and rocket fire from Hezbollah, instigated by Iran, towards Israel’s northern towns and cities, and the urgent need to restore security to the northern border and allow residents to return safely to their homes,” Herzog’s office added.” Remember: The latest fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, a powerful, Iran-backed paramilitary group that operates out of southern Lebanon, was sparked by the October 7 attacks by Hamas and the ensuing war in Gaza. Hezbollah has voiced support for Hamas and says it is fighting in support of the Palestinian people. This post has been updated with additional reporting on the meeting. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, says 193 of its staff have been killed since the war between Israel and Hamas began on October 7. “Despite this, our colleagues keep working to support families and provide aid amid the dire humanitarian crisis.” The agency added that it works in the most challenging circumstances and that its facilities continue to be targeted. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas and other militant groups of embedding themselves amid the civilian population, and it has also denied targeting civilian infrastructure. Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told CNN that he thinks there is “enough food” going into Gaza when pressed about the humanitarian crisis across the strip; however, he admitted there is “a problem with distribution.” Speaking to CNN’s Paula Hancocks at the Kerem Shalom border crossing, Hagari said the “tactical pause” was to ensure that the road is “safe for the trucks to drive on” and get more aid into the strip. He maintained that the government was fighting Hamas in Rafah. Hagari also told Hancocks that 1,200 trucks worth of aid, including food, water, medicine, and baby diapers, are currently waiting to be collected at the crossing. He pointed the finger at international aid groups for not distributing the aid. When pressed about safety concerns expressed by aid agencies, Hagari said Israel would “help them,” “monitor them,” and the “road will be safe, military wise it will be safe.” He did not give specific details about how Israel would help aid agencies secure their vehicles. Hagari previously said there would be a military presence along the route but, when pressed repeatedly by CNN, would not commit to providing military escort to convoys along the route. According to the United Nations, 254 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October. Hancocks also asked Hagari about the recent UN report that predicts half of Gaza’s population is “expected to face death and starvation” by mid-July. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has disbanded the country’s war cabinet, an Israeli official has told CNN Netanyahu’s decision comes after opposition leader Benny Gantz announced his withdrawal from the body last week, and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir’s request to join. The war cabinet was formed five days after the beginning of the war between Israel and Hamas and included not only Netanyahu and Gantz but also Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Other politicians such as Gadi Eisenkot and Ron Dermer also took part as observers. But Gantz – seen as Netanyahu’s most formidable political opponent – announced his “complex and painful” decision to withdraw from the cabinet last week, citing Netanyahu’s failure to devise a strategy for the conflict in Gaza and the future governance of the Strip. Gantz’s resignation sparked calls from far-right members in Netanyahu’s governing coalition, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, to join the war cabinet. Both men were earlier pointedly excluded from the cabinet at Gantz’s behest. By dismantling the cabinet, Netanyahu may have avoided having to accede to Ben-Gvir’s calls to join it, which could have further strained Israel’s relations with the United States, or having to reject his demands, which could have angered the more extreme wing of Netanyahu’s coalition. Another interpretation is that without Gantz – and Eisenkot who also resigned – in it, there was no longer any point in keeping the war cabinet going. Instead, an Israeli official tells CNN, Netanyahu will in the future hold smaller forums to discuss sensitive matters relating to the war with Hamas. It’s unclear whether Ben-Gvir will be excluded from these as well. Read more about Netanyahu disbanding the war cabinet here. Israel says it has introduced a daily “tactical pause” of military activity along a route in southern Gaza to allow aid to be distributed, but said there will be no let up in fighting in and around Rafah in southern Gaza. The pauses began on Saturday and will take place every day from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. local time until further notice to allow trucks to move from the Kerem Shalom Crossing, the main entry point for incoming aid to southern Gaza, up the Salah al-Din Road and northward, the Israel Defense Forces said. Soon after announcing the move, the Israeli military said “the fighting in Rafah continues,” adding “there is no change in the entry of goods into the Strip.” A bottleneck of aid has built up at Kerem Shalom amid Israeli airstrikes and fighting in much of southern Gaza. Dire humanitarian crisis: Human rights groups have described “unspeakable” living conditions for Palestinians in Gaza following eight months of Israeli bombardment. Israel’s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies. More than 50,000 children in Gaza now require treatment for acute malnutrition, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said in a post on X on Saturday. Last month, Israel pressed ahead with its ground operation in central Rafah, saying Hamas fighters are embedded in civilian areas of the enclave’s southernmost city. The operation has led hundreds of thousands of already displaced people to leave the area. Gazans say they have been bombed even when they evacuated to areas that were supposed to be safe — and that they have nowhere left to go. Internally displaced Palestinians are estimated to be crammed into an area of 69 square kilometers (27 square miles). Israeli leadership criticizes the move: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was unhappy when he first heard of the plan, according to an Israeli official. Netanyahu then contacted his military secretary and said this was unacceptable, until he was assured the fighting in Rafah would continue. It raises the question of where the “tactical pause” order originated, but it’s expected to continue. Israeli security minister Ben Gvir — a leading right-wing member of the country’s cabinet — condemned the pause. “Whoever decided on a ‘tactical pause’ for the purpose of a humanitarian transition, especially at a time when the best of our soldiers are falling in battle, is an evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position,” he said. Fighting and deadly strikes: Fierce fighting and airstrikes have rocked Rafah as the Israeli effort to destroy Hamas in Gaza continues. A civil defense official in the enclave told CNN heavy clashes were ongoing in neighborhoods of western Rafah on Sunday. Ahmed Radwan, the media officer of Rafah Civil Defense, said the organization had received pleas to collect bodies and wounded people, but it was difficult for crews to access many areas due to Israeli military operations. On Saturday, eight IDF soldiers were killed near the city, one of the single deadliest incidents of the war for Israeli troops. Eight Israeli soldiers were killed in southern Gaza on Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces says, in one of the deadliest single incidents involving its troops since October 7. The IDF told CNN that preliminary findings suggest an armored vehicle carrying soldiers as part of a convoy was hit by an explosion around 5:15 a.m. local time (10:15 p.m. ET Friday) during an operation targeting “terrorist infrastructure” in the Tal al-Sultan area near the city of Rafah. However, it’s unclear whether the blast was caused by an explosive device planted in the area or by the ignition of explosives being carried by the armored vehicle – or whether it was a mix of both. The incident remains under review. Earlier, Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, said it “carried out a complex ambush against enemy vehicles” operating in Tal al-Sultan. The militant group said it targeted a military bulldozer, which then caught on fire, killing and wounding the crew. When rescue troops arrived, the militant group then struck an armored personnel carrier, killing the soldiers, it said. The Israeli military said the damage from the explosion was so great that it was difficult to identify and locate the bodies of those killed. One of the dead soldiers was identified as Capt. Wassem Mahmoud, deputy company commander in the Engineering Battalion. The other seven names are yet to be disclosed. Rafah in crisis: The deadly explosion came as Israel continues its push into Rafah, the enclave’s southernmost city, where there were reports of more airstrikes and artillery shelling Saturday. Some of the fiercest fighting of recent days has been seen in Tal al-Sultan. The Israeli operation in Rafah has deepened the already dire humanitarian crisis for Palestinians in Gaza. Almost a million people — half of the enclave’s population — have been displaced in the past month by the operations, the Norwegian Refugee Council outlined in a report on Thursday. Gazans say they have nowhere left to go. The World Health Organization is warning of an “escalating health crisis” for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem due to rising Israeli violence, attacks on health infrastructure and increased restrictions on movement. Attacks by extremist Israeli settlers and incursions by the Israeli military in the occupied territories have spiked in the months since Hamas launched its October 7 attack from Gaza into southern Israel. The WHO has documented at least 480 attacks on health care, affecting 54 health facilities, 20 mobile clinics and 319 ambulances, with 59% of the attacks occurring in the cities of Tulkarem, Jenin and Nablus, the organization said in a statement Saturday. The WHO said access to health facilities has been further restricted by the closure of Israeli checkpoints, as well as “the siege and closure of entire towns and communities.” According to the health organization, a total of 521 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since October 7, including 126 children. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah puts the number higher, at 547 people killed, including 133 children over the same time period. US special envoy Amos Hochstein will arrive in Israel on Monday as tensions on the Israel-Lebanon border escalate, CNN analyst Barak Ravid reports, citing two Israeli officials. Israel and Hezbollah have recently been ramping up cross-border attacks after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border. Latest clashes: Hezbollah claimed at least three additional attacks against Israel on Saturday, including one that the Israel Defense Forces said started another fire. The IDF said the Hezbollah attack was carried out by drones carrying explosives. It also reported its own attack, saying an Israeli aircraft struck what it described as a Hezbollah terrorist in the area of Aitaroun in southern Lebanon, releasing aerial video of a motorbike being hit. Remember: The latest fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, a powerful, Iran-backed paramilitary group that operates out of southern Lebanon, was sparked by the October 7 attacks by Hamas and ensuing war in Gaza. Hezbollah has voiced support for Hamas and says it is fighting in support of the Palestinian people. A leader at the media organization Al Jazeera has rejected “all the excuses and accusations” that the Israeli government has made against the network and called it a “campaign of incitement” against the network’s staff in Israel. The comments come after an Israeli court upheld an order to extend the ban on Al Jazeera’s broadcasts within Israel for an additional 45 days. The Arabic news channel has produced dogged, on-the-ground reporting of Israel’s war in Gaza. Jerusalem bureau chief Walid Al Omary says the accusations against the network’s staff “endangers their lives and the lives of their families,” adding that he places “all responsibility for (the staff’s) safety on the authorities in Israel.” An Israeli court upheld an order to extend the ban on Al Jazeera broadcasts within Israel for an additional 45 days. The Israeli government requested the extension, and the Israeli High Court approved it on Thursday. According to the Tel Aviv District Court, the decision follows “a thorough review of both written and oral arguments presented by the involved parties.” CNN has contacted the Al Jazeera Media Network for comment. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Israel’s oldest and largest human rights organization, said in a statement that the court’s decision on Al Jazeera “violates freedom of expression and freedom of the press,” and the group is considering an appeal to the Supreme Court. Some background: In early May, the Israeli cabinet forced the network, which is funded in part by the government of Qatar, to close its operations in Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the time: “Al Jazeera reporters harmed Israel’s security and incited IDF soldiers. It is time to expel the mouthpiece of Hamas from our country.” CNN’s Eyad Kourdi, Eugenia Ugrinovich and Lauren Ido contributed reporting.",live coverage day ended follow latest israelhamas war news

cnn,"Train collision kills at least nine in eastern India, police say","Jun 18, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/17/india/india-west-bengal-train-crash-kanchanjunga-express-intl-hnk/index.html,"At least nine people were killed and dozens of others injured after a cargo train collided with a passenger train in eastern India on Monday, according to authorities, as a top official ordered a major emergency response. The Kanchenjunga Express, which runs between the city of Kolkata and Silchar in northeastern Assam state, was struck by a freight train south of the city of Siliguri, according to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Disaster teams have rushed to the crash location, which lies below the foothills that lead to Darjeeling, a popular mountain tourist destination famous for its tea plantations and stunning Himalayan views. Local media pictures and video footage from the scene showed at least one train car on its side, parts of it crushed into a mass of twisted metal. Another car can be seen rising into the air at a steep angle above an engine carriage. “Eight people were brought dead to the hospital and one patient who was in a very serious condition succumbed to his injuries overnight,” Sanjay Mallick, the medical superintendent of the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, told CNN. A total of 52 patients have been admitted to the hospital, he added. Banerjee wrote on X that “doctors, ambulances and disaster teams have been rushed to the site for rescue, recovery, medical assistance.” “Action on war-footing initiated,” she added. Live images from the site of the crash streamed live by local news channel TV 9 showed people gathered outside the carriages, some filming on their phones. The crash comes more than a year after India experienced one of the worst train disasters in the country’s history, when more than 280 people were killed in a three-way collision involving two passenger trains and a freight train in eastern Odisha state. That incident shocked the nation, renewing calls for authorities to confront safety issues in a railway system that transports more than 13 million passengers every day. India’s extensive rail network, one of the largest in the world, was built more than 160 years ago under British colonial rule. Today, it runs about 11,000 trains every day over 67,000 miles of tracks in the world’s most populous nation. But decaying infrastructure is often cited as a cause for traffic delays and numerous train accidents. Though government statistics show that accidents and derailments have been on the decline in recent years, they are still tragically common. More than 16,000 people were killed in nearly 18,000 railway accidents across the country in 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Most railway accidents were due to falls from trains and collisions between trains and people on the track. Train-on-train collisions are less common. On Monday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the West Bengal crash “saddening” and sent a message of condolence to the affected families. “I pray that the injured recover at the earliest. Spoke to officials and took stock of the situation. Rescue operations are underway to assist the affected,” Modi wrote on X. Upgrading India’s transportation infrastructure is a key priority for Modi in his push to create a $5 trillion economy by 2025. His government last year raised capital spending on airports, road and highway construction and other infrastructure projects to $122 billion, or 1.7% of its GDP. A significant portion of that spending is targeted at introducing more high-speed trains to India’s notoriously slow railways.

cnn,"Against the odds, the USA cricket team has captured hearts and minds with historic run at Men’s T20 Cricket World Cup","Jun 17, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/16/sport/usa-t20-cricket-world-cup-profile-spt-intl/index.html,"One is a software engineer. Another was a mobile phone sales representative, while a third only recently quit his job as a biomedical engineer. These are some of the players that are part of the USA men’s cricket team, which pulled off one of the greatest shocks in the sport’s long history in beating Pakistan at the T20 World Cup, while also giving powerhouse India a bit of a fright in the group stage. And now, it will be playing in the next round of the tournament having qualified for the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup after its game against Ireland on Friday was abandoned. Born and raised in Mumbai, India, USA bowler Saurabh Netravalkar began playing cricket from an early age. Such was the promise he showed that he was selected for India’s team for the Under-19 World Cup in 2010, finishing the tournament as the country’s leading wicket taker. After juggling playing the sport with other commitments, Netravalkar chose to focus on cricket in an attempt to make it to the full India national team. But, as the dream to represent India appeared to be fading away, Netravalkar moved to Cornell University in New York to continue his studies in computer science, though he continued to play cricket. In 2016, he got a job at technology company Orcale in San Francisco where he has worked ever since. While he was playing at weekends for club teams, Netravalkar was still a long way from international competition; not least because the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) rules at the time wouldn’t have qualified him for the USA national team. “I was on a student visa and then a work visa. So there was no question of playing for the team,” he told the BBC. However, those rules were subsequently loosened and Netravalkar quickly established himself as a vital cog in the USA’s bowling attack, being selected as the team’s captain and, at the time of writing, he is the country’s all-time leading wicket taker. But the highlight of his career to date came during that match against Pakistan. After the USA dragged the game against Pakistan to a Super Over and having set a competitive score of 18 runs, Netravalkar took the ball into his own hands. His combination of accuracy and variation bamboozled the Pakistani batters, limiting them to just 13 runs to secure a famous win in the USA’s debut appearance at the T20 World Cup. And one of the team’s key players, Aaron Jones, said that that moment was one which he and his teammates had “been dreaming about our whole lives.” “To play in a World Cup, especially in front of our home fans, and definitely to play against a full member nation and not only to play but to win against them is a great feeling,” Jones told CNN’s Patrick Snell. Full members nations are the 12 governing bodies from around the world recognised by the ICC from which representative teams are qualified to play official Test matches. Jones, was born in Queens, New York, to parents from Barbados, featuring for the Caribbean island before switching allegiances to the US. Just a few days later after beating Pakistan, the USA nearly had another famous scalp too, falling just short against India. Netravalkar once again shone with the ball, picking up the invaluable wicket of Virat Kohli, widely regarded as one of the greatest batters in cricket history, who went out facing his first ball, and then getting the wicket of India captain Rohit Sharma. Netravalkar isn’t the only the USA team player juggling work commitments. Veteran USA bowler Ali Khan was selling mobile phones in Dayton, Ohio, just a few years ago, while spinner Nosthush Kenjige gave up his job as a biomedical engineer to focus on his cricket. “The opportunity is more than a dream,” Kenjige told USA Cricket. “My life has always revolved around cricket.” The USA team boasts players with connections to India, Pakistan, South Africa and New Zealand, while its coach is Australian Stuart Law. The victory against Pakistan was one which not only shocked the cricketing world, but also broke through into the wider US sports discourse. Not only is the US one of the co-hosts for the T20 World Cup for the first time, but it is making its debut appearance on this stage. It comes at an important moment for the sport in the US too, with efforts being made to establish a foothold in the country in recent years. Notably, Major League Cricket (MLC) – a professional T20 league held in the US – began last year, with international stars from across the globe helping kickstart a new era for the sport in the country. Jones, who has been one of the USA’s key contributors during the tournament, in particular with his 94 runs in their opening game of the World Cup against Canada, believes his team’s success so far can be seed for further engagement in cricket in the country going forward. “We always want to really and truly open the eyes of Americans as it relates to cricket,” the 29-year-old batter said. “I think it’s a big market as it relates to cricket. “We are just happy that we can play home.

There had been heavy rainfall overnight ahead of the match in Lauderhill, Florida, and despite the ground staff’s best efforts, the game was unable to be played, with both teams earning a point as a result. It was a momentous point for USA, which saw its qualification for the Super 8 stage of the tournament confirmed, a remarkable achievement given the team is appearing in its first ever T20 World Cup. The USA’s performances over the course of the group stage have been one of the headline talking points of the tournament so far, having beaten powerhouse Pakistan and barely losing to India. One of the co-hosts for the T20 World Cup, the USA opened up its campaign with a convincing victory over Canada and finishes its Group A stage on five points. As a result of Friday’s abandonment, Pakistan was elimated from the tournament. The top two teams in each of the tournament’s four groups advance to the Super 8 stage where they will be split into two more groups. The four teams in those two groups will play one another in a round-robin format, with the top two advancing to the semifinal stage.

cnn,T20 Cricket World Cup: India just edges past USA despite host nation’s valiant effort,"Jun 13, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/12/sport/t20-cricket-world-cup-india-beats-usa-spt-intl/index.html,"India proved too strong for the USA at the T20 Cricket World Cup, with the joint host falling to a seven-wicket defeat in New York on Wednesday. The USA beat Pakistan in a historic victory earlier in the tournament but failed to follow it up with a win against heavy favorite India – despite the underdog pushing the cricket powerhouse close throughout. India now tops Group A with six points having won all three of its games at the World Cup, with the USA in second place with four points. Despite the defeat, the USA still has a good chance of progressing to the next round of the tournament and faces Ireland in their last group stage game, needing a win to secure its spot in the knockout stages. If there was ever hope of an upset, it looked like India quickly put a stop to it. Having won the toss, India elected to field first at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York, which has been favorable for bowlers so far throughout the tournament. Arshdeep Singh was given the new ball and with it took a wicket with the very first delivery of the game – the left-arm seamer swinging a ball back into USA’s opening batter Shayan Jahangir and getting him out leg before wicket (LBW). Singh followed it up with the wicket of Andries Gous in the same over and India was already firmly in the driving seat. The USA innings never really got going following the early dominance from the Indian bowlers and the fielding side continued to pile on the misery for the home nation. Despite Nitish Kumar’s best efforts, leading the American batters with 27 runs, the USA was reduced to 110-8 following its 20 overs batting. Singh was the star of the Indian bowling attack and took an impressive four wickets for just nine runs in the four overs he bowled. Needing just 111 to win, most onlookers would have been expecting an easy chase for India. USA bowler Saurabh Netravalkar had other ideas. The left-arm quick picked up the invaluable wicket of Virat Kohli, widely regarded as one of the greatest batters in history, who went out facing his first ball, and then Netravalkar got the wicket of India captain Rohit Sharma. Nerves would have surely been felt throughout the Indian camp but Indian batters Rishabh Pant and Suryakumar Yadav helped ease the worries with a steady partnership. Just when India looked to be cruising to the total, USA managed to pile on the pressure again with Ali Khan bowling out Pant for 18. As the pressure piled up, so did the dot balls and suddenly the underdogs were well in the game. But as all great teams do, India found a way to take back control of proceedings. Yadav, now joined by Shivam Dube, kept the runs ticking to prevent what would have been one of cricket’s greatest ever upsets and scored an impressive 50 runs for India. During the chase, the USA was also penalized for taking too much time between overs and gave five penalty runs to India, which dented US hopes at a pivotal moment. Despite being denied another historic victory, the USA can certainly be pleased with their efforts in defeat. “I’m really proud of the bowling unit today,” USA captain Aaron Jones told the broadcast after the game. “This is something that we’ve been talking about over the last couple of years, wanting more fans for USA cricket, so now is a time that we’re really enjoying it.”",india proved strong usa cricket world cup joint host falling sevenwicket defeat new york wednesday usa beat pakistan historic victory earlier tournament failed follow win heavy favorite india despite underdog pushing cricket powerhouse close throughout india top group six point three game world cup usa second place four point despite defeat usa still good chance progressing next round tournament face ireland last group stage game needing win secure spot knockout stage ever hope upset looked like india quickly put stop toss india elected field first nassau county international cricket stadium new york favorable bowler far throughout tournament arshdeep singh given new ball took wicket first delivery game leftarm seamer swinging ball back usa opening batter shayan jahangir getting leg wicket lbw singh followed wicket andries gous india already firmly driving seat usa inning never really got going following early dominance indian bowler fielding side continued pile misery home nation despite nitish kumars best effort leading american batter run usa reduced following over batting singh star indian bowling attack took impressive four wicket nine run four over bowled needing win onlooker would expecting easy chase india usa bowler saurabh netravalkar idea leftarm quick picked invaluable wicket virat kohli widely regarded one greatest batter history went facing first ball netravalkar got wicket india captain rohit sharma nerve would surely felt throughout indian camp indian batter rishabh pant suryakumar yadav helped ease worry steady partnership india looked cruising total usa managed pile pressure ali khan bowling pant pressure piled dot ball suddenly underdog well game great team india found way take back control proceeding yadav joined shivam dube kept run ticking prevent would one cricket greatest ever upset scored impressive run india chase usa also penalized taking much time over gave five penalty run india dented u hope pivotal moment despite denied another historic victory usa certainly pleased effort defeat im really proud bowling unit today usa captain aaron jones told broadcast game something weve talking last couple year wanting fan usa cricket time really enjoying,43.0,positive,0

Fifty thousand women in 22 districts across the states of Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Gujarat received a $5 payments as temperatures topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) last month in several parts of the country. “This is the first time that insurance payouts and a direct cash assistance program have been combined to supplement the income of women when it’s dangerously hot,” said Kathy Baughman McLeod, CEO of Climate Resilience for All, a not-for-profit organization that designed the insurance in partnership with India’s Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), a trade union with nearly three million members. From small farmers to casual laborers, many SEWA members depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, and that makes them particularly vulnerable to climate change. Indian women working in agriculture typically earn about 300 rupees ($3.60) per day. Outdoor work in such extreme heat can lead to chronic rashes, dizziness, burns, infections, and miscarriage, according to Climate Resilience for All. Such high temperatures can also destroy crops or merchandise, which can have a debilitating impact on household debt for low-income families. The insurance is underwritten by Swiss Re and provided locally by ICICI Lombard. More than 46,000 women were given additional insurance payments, with some receiving up to $19.80 each. Overall payments across the program amounted to over $340,000, Climate Resilience for All said in a statement on Wednesday. “The money from the program has allowed me to pay for my medical expenses and to buy food for my family,” said Arunaben Makwana, one of the beneficiaries, said in the statement. The insurance plan is currently offered to members of SEWA, who work across India’s vast informal sector. According to McLeod, the program may be rolled out to more communities across South Asia, as well as east and west Africa in the coming year. Such insurance initiatives may become critical worldwide as policymakers grapple with a much hotter planet. India has endured a scorching summer — with a part of the capital of Delhi recording the country’s highest-ever temperature of 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 Fahrenheit) last month. Rising mercury levels in the country risks reversing progress on poverty alleviation, health and economic growth, experts say. India is “expected to lose about 5.8% of daily working hours due to heat stress in 2030,” said a United Nations’ Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) report in April. “The problem is most severe for outdoor workers, particularly those employed in agriculture and construction, but also relevant for indoor factory workers,” it added.",oneofitskind insurance policy started making payouts ten thousand woman across india help cope impact extreme heat fifty thousand woman district across state rajasthan maharashtra gujarat received payment temperature topped degree celsius fahrenheit last month several part country first time insurance payouts direct cash assistance program combined supplement income woman dangerously hot said kathy baughman mcleod ceo climate resilience notforprofit organization designed insurance partnership india selfemployed woman association sewa trade union nearly three million member small farmer casual laborer many sewa member depend agriculture livelihood make particularly vulnerable climate change indian woman working agriculture typically earn rupee per day outdoor work extreme heat lead chronic rash dizziness burn infection miscarriage according climate resilience high temperature also destroy crop merchandise debilitating impact household debt lowincome family insurance underwritten swiss provided locally icici lombard woman given additional insurance payment receiving overall payment across program amounted climate resilience said statement wednesday money program allowed pay medical expense buy food family said arunaben makwana one beneficiary said statement insurance plan currently offered member sewa work across india vast informal sector according mcleod program may rolled community across south asia well east west africa coming year insurance initiative may become critical worldwide policymakers grapple much hotter planet india endured scorching summer part capital delhi recording country highestever temperature degree celsius fahrenheit last month rising mercury level country risk reversing progress poverty alleviation health economic growth expert say india expected lose daily working hour due heat stress said united nation economic social commission asia pacific escap report april problem severe outdoor worker particularly employed agriculture construction also relevant indoor factory worker added,-15.0,negative,0
cnn,Pakistan succumbs to heartbreaking defeat against archrival India in T20 Cricket World Cup,"Jun 10, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/09/sport/t20-cricket-world-cup-pakistan-india-spt-intl/index.html,"Pakistan’s heartbreaking Men’s T20 Cricket World Cup continued as it succumbed to a dramatic six-run defeat against archrival India on Sunday following its shock loss to the USA earlier in the week. After these two defeats, Pakistan’s progression in this tournament rests on a knife edge, dependent on the USA’s results, who now have a golden chance to make the knockout stages. Such a scenario seemed unlikely for most of the match as India set a relatively low score of 119 all out and Pakistan began its run chase with composure, but key wickets lost at crucial times consigned it to a damaging defeat. Often described as one of the greatest sporting grudge matches in the world, an India-Pakistan cricket match is always bound up in the geopolitical faultlines that separate the two nations. They only play each other in international tournaments, and such was the level of excitement that on the morning of the game, it cost a minimum of $2,500 for a seat at the Nassau County International Stadium in New York. Security, including monitoring the fence line, checking cars and patrolling using horses and drones, was increased ahead of the match, with a Nassau County official telling CNN that an earlier threat by terror group ISIS-K was considered credible until proven otherwise. Rain delayed the start of the match by almost an hour and the sky was still gloomy when India’s opening batsmen Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli walked out onto the crease. Rohit heaved the third ball into the stands for six to get India’s innings off to the best possible start, but they were forced to leave the field after just one over to take cover from another rain shower. It seemed that India would continue where the opening pair had left off when Kohli opened his account with a glorious cover drive for four, but he was out just two balls later. And Pakistan landed a hammer blow in the next over when Rohit hit the ball straight to Haris Rauf off Shaheen Afridi, removing both of India’s talismanic batters in quick succession. It was left to Rishabh Pant to restore order and though he hit boundary after boundary, India always looked shaky without establishing any sort of partnership and collapsed from 89-3 to 96-7 in the 15th over, leaving little hope of posting a competitive score. Eventually, the tail limped to 119 all out, a low score even on this temporary pitch which, with lots of uneven bounce and a sluggish outfield, has proven difficult to bat on throughout the tournament. Pakistan made an assured start to its run chase, chipping away at India’s total and seemed completely in control of the match with star batsman Mohammad Rizwan anchoring the innings. But the game turned on its head with six overs left when Jasprit Bumrah bowled Rizwan and took the momentum away from Pakistan. It set up a grandstand finish with Pakistan needing 18 runs off six balls in the last over and it ultimately fell just short.

cnn,"June 9, 2024 Israel-Hamas war","Jun 10, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-06-09-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended for the day. Read the latest on Benny Gantz’s resignation here. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday called on Benny Gantz to change his mind and return to the emergency cabinet. “Citizens of Israel, we will continue until victory and all the goals of the war have been achieved, most importantly, the release of all our hostages and the elimination of Hamas,” Netanyahu said. Netanyahu said his door remained open to any political party that is ready to share in the burden of fighting the war against Hamas, and will “help bring victory over our enemies and ensure the security of our citizens.” Israeli minister Benny Gantz has quit the country’s war cabinet, criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an obstacle to victory in Gaza. He had threatened to leave the emergency government if Netanyahu did not present a new plan for defeating Hamas, freeing hostages and the post-war governance of Gaza by this weekend. Gantz, who is Netanyahu’s primary political rival and leads him in public opinion polls, called for the prime minister to hold an election in the coming months. Gantz’s resignation comes shortly after a surprise Israeli operation that freed four hostages from Nuseirat, in central Gaza. The raid also led to the deadliest day of Israel’s war in Gaza in six months, with at least 274 people killed in the Nuseirat operation alone, Gazan health officials said. CNN cannot independently verify the toll. Here’s what else to know if you’re just joining us today: Outgoing Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold an election in the coming months as he announced his resignation from the country’s emergency government, eight months after the October 7 Hamas attacks. Gantz said he was quitting the war cabinet because “the situation in the country and in the decision-making room has changed.” Gantz said Netanyahu was putting his own personal political considerations ahead of a post-war strategy for the Gaza Strip. Some context: Gantz is viewed as Netanyahu’s primary political rival, and Israeli opinion polls suggest that he would win an election against the prime minister if one were held now. Gone from the war cabinet. Gone from the government. Benny Gantz is back where he was at the start of the war Hamas launched on October 7: an ex-defense minister, ex-chief of staff, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s chief political rival. You can’t say he didn’t warn us. On May 18, he announced that if Netanyahu didn’t come up with a coherent plan to bring the hostages home and for the governance of post-war Gaza (among other things), then he’d leave the war cabinet by June 8. In light of Saturday’s rescue of four Israeli hostages, he delayed making good on his threat — by a day. “Leaving the government is a complex and painful decision,” Gantz said in a news conference on Sunday evening in Israel. But, “Netanyahu prevents us from moving forward to a real victory (in Gaza).” So what now? The three most pressing areas of interest where Gantz’s resignation may be felt — at least for Israelis, the Palestinians in Gaza, and the outside world — are the Israeli government, the running of the war with Hamas, and Gantz’s own political prospects. Perhaps the most important impact of Gantz’s departure is the one it won’t have: it won’t cause the government to collapse. That’s because Netanyahu and his coalition partners still have 64 of the Knesset’s 120 seats. So unless President Biden’s — sorry, Israel’s — hostage deal gets done, and Netanyahu’s far-right ministers make good on their threats to leave the government, Netanyahu could safely stay in office until elections are due in October 2026 (opinion polls suggest that if they were held now, Gantz would win). It remains to be seen what a Gantz-free government means for the Palestinians in Gaza. Gantz is no dove, and his “moderating” hand was unlikely to have resulted in Israel going any “easier” on Hamas, or causing fewer civilian casualties. But both Gantz and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant have no qualms about disagreeing publicly with Netanyahu, and they may have been able to call him out if the prime minister were to block a potential hostage deal for personal political reasons. With Gantz gone, that seems less likely — as does the likelihood of a hostage deal being consummated any time soon. Key Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz quit Israel’s emergency government on Sunday, criticizing Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he announced his resignation. “That is why we are leaving the emergency government today — with a heavy heart, but with a whole heart,” the former Israeli defense minister said. Some background: Gantz, who is viewed as Netanyahu’s primary political rival, was originally expected to resign Saturday, which marked his self-imposed deadline to leave the government if Netanyahu did not lay out a new plan for the war in Gaza and the future of the enclave. He postponed a scheduled news conference as reports emerged of the Israeli operation to rescue four hostages in central Gaza. Gantz’s departure deals a blow to Netanyahu, who faces mounting international pressure to end the conflict in Gaza, daily mass protests in Israel, and growing domestic political pressure. What this means for Israel’s government: Gantz’s withdrawal from the government will not collapse Netanyahu’s majority in the country’s legislature, because Gantz is not part of the governing coalition. But it does risk further isolation for the embattled premier on an international stage. It also leaves the war cabinet, set up four days after Hamas’ October 7 attack, without representation from any political party other than Netanyahu’s Likud. Former Israeli defense minister and key war cabinet member Benny Gantz is speaking to reporters as uncertainty surrounds his continued membership in the country’s wartime emergency government. The war cabinet — which includes Gantz, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant — met just before Gantz started speaking, an Israeli official told CNN. How we got here: Gantz was originally expected to resign Saturday, which marked his self-imposed deadline to leave the government if Netanyahu did not lay out a new plan for the war in Gaza and the future of the enclave. Gantz, who is viewed as Netanyahu’s primary political rival, postponed a scheduled news conference yesterday as reports emerged of the Israeli operation to rescue four hostages in central Gaza. Gantz later released a statement that did not address whether he would still leave the government. He celebrated the rescue but also noted Israel’s remaining challenges, including freeing the other 120 hostages still held in Gaza. Netanyahu, meanwhile, called late Saturday for Gantz to stay in the emergency government, saying it is a time for the country to show unity. More context: Gantz’s withdrawal from the government would not collapse Netanyahu’s majority in the country’s legislature, because Gantz is not part of the governing coalition. But it would risk further isolation for the embattled premier on an international stage. This comes at a time of daily mass protests in Israel, with many demonstrators calling for immediate elections and the hostages’ release, and some wanting an end to further humanitarian aid being allowed into Gaza. Netanyahu also faces growing domestic political pressure from the country’s far-right, while the US and some Israelis urge him to accept a ceasefire deal with Hamas. This post has been updated to reflect the war cabinet meeting and Gantz speaking. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said an “enduring ceasefire” deal between Israel and Hamas is “the only credible path forward” after an Israeli hostage rescue mission that Gazan officials say killed at least 274 people. US President Joe Biden unveiled the three-phase proposal late last month, saying Israel had submitted the plan, though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments since have left some doubt over his level of support for the proposal as laid out by Biden. Civilians in harm’s way: Sullivan acknowledged the civilian toll of Israel’s military operation Saturday while saying Hamas, which took the hostages during its deadly October 7 attacks on Israel, was putting Palestinians in harm’s way. Pressed by Bash on whether the US was comfortable with how the mission was carried out, Sullivan called for a diplomatic solution “where there’s no need for military operations to get every last hostage out.” US Sen. Tom Cotton also laid blame on Hamas for keeping hostages in civilian areas Sunday. “You shouldn’t take hostages in the first place. You should release them once you have, and you certainly shouldn’t hide them in civilian areas,” Cotton told Fox News. The Arkansas Republican said the operation, which has drawn condemnation from regional leaders, was “heroic” and “well-executed.” CNN’s Ebony Davis contributed reporting to this post. Israel’s deadly operation to free four hostages from central Gaza on Saturday has received condemnation from some global leaders after 274 Palestinians were killed in the raid, according to figures from the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces disputes those numbers, saying it estimates the casualties were “under 100.” CNN cannot independently verify death tolls from the enclave due to the lack of international media access. Video and eyewitness accounts detailed scenes of horror during the operation at the Nuseirat refugee camp. Here’s what we’ve heard from leaders who condemned Israel’s attack: Survivors risked their lives to help take wounded people to hospitals in central Gaza on Saturday as a major Israeli military operation brought the deadliest day for the enclave in six months, according to the Gaza health ministry. Israel unleashed heavy shelling and artillery fire on the Nuseirat refugee camp and surrounding areas during its operation to rescue four hostages Saturday. Palestinians hurt in the attack on Nuseirat were rushed to nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. One man who was injured in the strike, speaking with bloodstained hands and his arm in what looks like a sling, said he and his friend helped transport people to the hospital despite his injuries, as he said no aid organizations were able to enter. CNN video from the hospital showed many people carrying wounded children in their arms, covered in blood. More kids crowded the floor of the emergency room. People screamed and cried as they said goodbye to loved ones at the morgue. Nidal Abdo says he was shopping in Nuseirat when a “crazy bombardment” hit. “They wiped out Nuseirat. It is hell on earth,” he said after the attack Saturday. Another local, Abu Abdallah, said the strikes hit while people were sleeping. “Dogs were eating people’s remains,” he said. Saturday was Gaza’s deadliest single day since mid-December, with 283 people killed, the Ministry of Health in Gaza reported Sunday. That brings the ministry’s total death toll during the current war in Gaza to 37,084. Most of those killed Saturday died when the Israel Defense Forces mounted a surprise operation to rescue four Israeli hostages in Nuseirat in central Gaza. The raid resulted in 274 Palestinians being killed and 698 injured, the Gaza Ministry of Health said Sunday. The IDF has disputed those numbers, saying it estimated the number of casualties from the operation was “under 100.” The health ministry does not distinguish between casualties among civilians and Hamas fighters. CNN cannot independently verify the ministry’s casualty figures due to the lack of international media access to Gaza. Palestinian civilians described “hell on earth” in central Gaza during the Israeli operation, and CNN video showed people rushing bloodied children into packed emergency rooms after the attack. An additional nine people were killed and 116 injured elsewhere in the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said. It marked the deadliest day in Gaza since December 10, when nearly 300 people were killed, according to Ministry of Health records. US response: The United States administration, which aided with intelligence gathering for the operation, acknowledged Sunday that civilians died in the attack. In response to Hamas’ claim that other hostages were killed during the mission — which it has not yet provided evidence for — Sullivan said, “We have not seen that verified or confirmed. I believe that the Israelis have said they do not have any information to that effect. But of course, that is always a risk.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the Israeli military’s “heroic operation” to rescue four hostages being held in Gaza, vowing at Sunday’s cabinet meeting that the government will continue “to do everything we can” to recover all those being held in the enclave. “Our heroic warriors charged as one man into the fire, they eliminated the terrorists and freed the hostages,” Netanyahu told cabinet members, saying he approved the “complex and dangerous operation” on Thursday evening. Netanyahu did not acknowledge in his remarks the death toll in Gaza as a result of carrying out the operation. The rescue has brought enormous relief to the families of the four rescued. Meir thanked the Israeli military and government for rescuing the hostages, but she pointed out that dozens of captives are still in Gaza and urged the government to secure their release. Hagai Levine of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said military raids alone would not secure all the hostage’s freedom. An Egyptian official has told CNN that Israel’s security operation in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza on Saturday will have a “negative effect” on negotiations to end the war in Gaza. Israel heavily bombarded central Gaza as it carried out the operation to rescue four hostages, killing more than 200 Palestinians and wounding many others, according to Gaza hospital officials. CNN is not able to independently verify the media office’s numbers, and there is no clarity on the breakdown of civilian and militant casualties. Egypt, along with Qatar, has been helping to coordinate negotiations between Israel and Hamas. Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken held a flurry of calls with key allies in the Middle East as part of an urgent campaign to push Hamas toward accepting the latest Israeli ceasefire and hostage proposal that would pause the fighting in Gaza. Blinken is expected to travel to the Middle East this week, visiting Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Qatar to “discuss with partners the need to reach a ceasefire agreement that secures the release of all hostages,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller announced Friday. Thirty-three people were arrested on Saturday in anti-government protests in Tel Aviv, according to police, as demonstrators blocked roads demanding the release of all hostages held in Gaza and calling for a ceasefire deal. Police said several hundred demonstrators on Kaplan Street, informally known as Democracy Square, violated the public order, blocking traffic, lighting fires and confronting police. Authorities arrested the 33 people who were blocking major roads and cleared the demonstrations, police said, adding that all roads have since reopened. Video of the protests on Saturday showed police deploying water cannons to clear the crowds, sparking concerns over police violence. In separate posts, opposition leader Yair Lapid and Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz expressed concern over reports of police violence and called for investigations into the allegations. Political turmoil: The Israeli government is under intense pressure to recover the more than 100 hostages still held in the Gaza Strip, with weekly protests calling for their release. Many are also demanding new elections, saying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s current government must step down. This comes as Netanyahu faces growing domestic political tension, including the possible resignation of Gantz, a key member of the country’s emergency wartime government. After the rescue of four Israeli hostages from Gaza on Saturday, the Israeli prime minister called on Gantz not to leave the wartime emergency government, saying, “We must remain united within ourselves in the face of the great tasks before us.” Israel’s operation to rescue four hostages took weeks of preparation and involved hundreds of personnel, its military said. But the mission began with a trail of destruction in central Gaza and ended in carnage, according to local authorities. Staff from Israel’s military, the domestic intelligence service, and a police special unit raided two buildings on Saturday, 200 meters (650 feet) apart, in the Nuseirat refugee camp, where intelligence reports said the hostages were being held. They rescued four hostages – Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv – eight months after they were kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7. An Israeli policeman who was part of the special counter-terrorism unit was killed in the operation. Israel heavily bombarded central Gaza as it carried out the operation, killing more than 200 Palestinians and wounding many others, according to Gaza hospital officials. CNN has no way of verifying casualty numbers reported by Palestinian officials in Gaza. Medical records in the war-torn enclave do not differentiate between civilians and militants killed. The special operation was months in the making, and Israeli forces prepared by building models of the apartments the hostages were being held in to train in, Hagari said. Previous attempts to launch such a raid had been called off at the last minute “more than three or four times,” due to unfavorable conditions. Read the full story here. The father of Almog Meir Jan, one of the four hostages rescued from Gaza on Saturday, died in his home that day before finding out that his son had been freed, according to Israel’s emergency services, the Magen David Adom (MDA). Yossi Meir passed away just hours before his son’s return to Israel, the father’s sister told CNN affiliate Channel 11 (Kan News). Authorities found Meir unconscious when they went to notify him of his son’s rescue and he was later declared dead in his home by emergency services, MDA told CNN. Almog Meir Jan, along with Noa Argamani, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv, were freed from captivity at two separate locations in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza by an Israeli special military operation, with the help of US intelligence. At least 236 people were killed in the operation and hundreds more were injured, according to hospital officials in the enclave. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has called for an emergency session of the UN Security Council to discuss what the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs called “a gruesome massacre” by Israel as it rescued four hostages. On Saturday, Israel heavily bombarded central Gaza as it carried out an operation to rescue four hostages from the refugee camp, killing more than 200 Palestinians and wounding hundreds more, according to Gaza hospital officials, who put the latest death toll figure at 236. CNN has no way of verifying casualty numbers reported by Palestinian officials in Gaza. Medical records in the war-torn enclave do not differentiate between civilians and militants killed. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) received two reports Saturday of ships being struck off Yemen’s port city of Aden. The first report came from a capital on a vessel of an incident 80 nautical miles southeast of Aden. An Antigua and Barbuda-flagged general cargo ship was heading southwest along the Gulf of Aden at a speed of 8.2 knots when the forward station was struck by a missile, according to British security firm Ambrey. The capital said the strike by an “unknown projectile” led to a small fire which has been extinguished, according to the UKMTO. All crew are safe and the vessel is proceeding to its next port call, the UKMTO said. A second incident was reported late Saturday around 70 nautical miles southwest of Aden of a ship struck by an “unknown projectile,” which resulted in a fire, according to the UKMTO. The area has seen frequent attacks on shipping by Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who are acting in solidarity with Palestinians over the war in Gaza. The Israeli military rescued four hostages held in central Gaza on Saturday in a major daytime operation. The strip’s government media office said at least 236 Palestinians were killed and more than 400 injured as Israel carried out the raid. Here’s what we know. A rare rescue: Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv were freed from captivity by the Israeli military, intelligence and special forces in two separate locations in the Nuseirat refugee camp, the Israel Defense Forces said Saturday. All four were kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7. This is only the third such successful operation since the war began. Over 200 Palestinians dead: How the operation happened: Israeli forces prepared for weeks for Saturday’s special military raid. IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the hostages had been locked in rooms of apartments in multistory civilian buildings. The IDF opted for a daytime operation for the element of surprise, and similar raids had been called off at the last minute several times, he said. Hagari estimated the number of casualties from the operation to be “under 100.” The raid also resulted in the death of an Israeli police officer who served in a special counterterrorism unit, according to Israeli police. Families reunited, but still call for action: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with rescued hostages and their families at Sheba Hospital in the city of Ramat Gan. Argamani was transferred to Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv so she can be treated there alongside her mother, who has late-stage brain cancer. Family members expressed joy at being reunited with their loved ones but also called for the Israeli government to bring back all the hostages still held in Gaza. US response: An American cell in Israel supported the rescue efforts, working with Israeli forces on the operation, a US official told CNN — referencing a team that’s been in place supporting Israel since October 7 with information gathering about the hostages. US President Joe Biden said Saturday he welcomed news of the rescue, and the White House said it is “supporting all efforts” to get the remaining hostages released.",live coverage ended day read

cnn,India’s Modi and his Hindu-nationalist party have another five years in power. What does it mean for the world?,"Jun 9, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/08/india/modi-india-foreign-policy-intl-hnk/index.html,"Narendra Modi has raised India’s stature on the global stage like no other recent leader of the world’s most populous country. The prime minister – who secured a rare third term in office this week – has positioned India and its fast-growing economy as a crucial player in global issues like climate change and development, while cementing New Delhi as a key security partner for the United States and an aspiring leader of the Global South. Modi’s victory will give the 73-year-old leader and his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) another five years to raise India’s global stature – and to manage its contentious relationships and contested borders with nuclear-armed neighbors China and Pakistan. But the election results also place Modi in a radically different position from the one he enjoyed during his first decade in power. The larger-than-life leader and his BJP fell well short of an expected outright majority and must rely on coalition partners to form a government. That has widely been seen as a shock setback for the leader and his party, who have been accused by critics of fueling Islamophobia and religious violence in India, while rolling back civil liberties and failing to solve livelihood issues like soaring youth unemployment. Now, Modi will need to “devote a lot of time to (domestic affairs to) keep the government intact with a coalition with different agendas,” said T.V. Paul, author of “The Unfinished Quest: India’s Search for Major Power Status from Nehru to Modi.” “This idea of India pushing its weight around may be much less feasible for the time being, given that foreign policy issues did not impact the (election) decision as much as people had thought.” One aspect of India’s international ambitions that’s unlikely to shift in Modi’s new term is New Delhi’s relationship with Washington – a connection that has helped burnish the prime minister’s profile as a power player. India has emerged as a key security partner for the US, a pillar of its Quad security grouping alongside Japan and Australia, and expanding cooperation on high tech and defense in the face of shared concern about an increasingly assertive and powerful China. In a congratulatory message to Modi on his win earlier this week, US President Joe Biden hailed the US-India friendship as “only growing as we unlock a shared future of unlimited potential.” That relationship is only likely to strengthen in the near term, according to analysts. “The two countries have shared concerns over regional stability and are overseeing a burgeoning defense cooperation,” said Farwa Aamer, director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York. “We can expect a more assertive India aligning closely with US interests in the Indo-Pacific and expanding tech cooperation.” Ties between New Delhi and Washington have warmed in recent years even as Modi has firmly pursued India’s policy of strategic autonomy to push for a global order not purely dominated by the US or the US-China rivalry – another goal expected to remain unchanged by the election. For example, New Delhi has refused to give up its close relations with Russia, despite US pressure for its partners to cut ties with the warring country. But one question is how Modi’s third term will affect percolating concerns in American policy circles about a widely documented backsliding of civil liberties in India under his right-wing leadership – as well as accusations the BJP aims to marginalize the country’s Muslim minority of more than 200 million. India has also faced significant allegations of extraterritorial overreach, which raise questions about the risks of the country’s growing confidence, assertiveness – and commitment to international norms – under Modi. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in September said his country was investigating “credible allegations” linking India to the killing of a Canadian citizen and prominent Sikh leader. New Delhi hit back fiercely, accusing Canada of harboring terrorists and not acting against extremists, even as it denied the allegation. Two months later, US prosecutors also alleged that an Indian agent was behind a foiled murder-for-hire plot targeting an American Sikh activist. New Delhi denied any involvement in that alleged plot and set up a high-level committee to investigate the accusation. One factor to watch following Modi’s bruising election win, experts say, is whether the new government ramps up or tones down posturing that impacts India’s relations with its South Asian neighbors. They point to how Hindu nationalism over the past decade has not only stoked division and violence within the country, but threatened to inflame frictions in the region, especially with Pakistan – often the target of heated BJP rhetoric. Now, Modi’s BJP will need to answer the interests of its coalition allies – and face stronger checks from a resurgent opposition, which could dampen its Hindu-nationalist agenda. And analysts stress it will take time to see how the BJP calibrates policy aims and rhetoric based on this new political reality. “If it is normal politics, it would seem that the elbows would not be as sharp on various issues,” said Sushant Singh, a lecturer at Yale University in the US. “But to cater to their nationalist support base, (the BJP) may actually take the other path,” to ramp up rhetoric, he added. “We’ll have to see what political call is taken.” Such a reaction could also be driven by the BJP’s relative position of weakness going into this term, observers say, noting that Modi’s landslide win in the 2019 elections followed a ratcheting of tensions with Pakistan. Then, India claimed to have launched airstrikes on what it alleged was a terrorist training camp across its de facto border with Pakistan after a car bombing killed Indian paramilitary forces, in an incident disputed by Islamabad. The BJP uses the “otherization of the image of Pakistan to rally its core Hindutva base,” said Fahd Humayun, an assistant professor of political science at Tufts University in the US, referring to the ruling party’s ideology that India is inherently a land for Hindus. “To that end, it is not difficult to imagine a scenario in which, with its back against the wall, an embattled Modi government plays up the perceptions of external threats to try and rally domestic constituencies.” In his weakened position, Modi may also be pressed to respond assertively to any perceived threats from China, observers say. Modi has appeared unwilling to risk confrontation with India’s militarily superior neighbor, despite being slammed by critics for what they say was a soft response to deadly 2020 clashes along their disputed Himalayan border. Governments and policymakers across the world will be watching for how these issues evolve in the coming months. In the meantime, some observers suggest that while the election results may not have boosted Modi, they are already a boon for India’s global clout. “If he has won a (super) majority and pushed the Hindu agenda, it would have probably dented India’s (international) agenda,” said Paul, the author, who is also a professor at McGill University in Canada. Paul said democracy was “India’s biggest soft power tradition” and its perceived resurgence in the election may boost the country’s image among liberal nations. “India coming back as a proper democracy is good for the world order in many senses,” he added. But “it all depends how Modi will play this game.”",narendra modi raised india stature global stage like recent leader world populous country prime minister secured rare third term office week

cnn,USA orchestrates shock defeat of Pakistan at Men’s T20 Cricket World Cup,"Jun 7, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/06/sport/usa-pakistan-t20-cricket-world-cup/index.html,"The US cricket team orchestrated a shocking defeat of powerhouse Pakistan following a dramatic Super Over victory at the Men’s T20 Cricket World Cup on Thursday in Dallas. The thrilling win was the biggest in US cricket history and is already being regarded as one of the biggest upsets in the sport. Team captain Monank Patel, who was named player of the match, spoke about what the landmark victory meant to the team and the country. “I am happy with the win. Playing against Pakistan for the first time in the World Cup and beating them, it was an unbelievable performance from our side,” he told reporters after the match. “I would say it’s a big day for Team USA and for the USA cricket community too,” he added. The United States is making its first appearance at the T20 World Cup and is co-hosting the tournament for the first time, along with the West Indies. The magnitude of Thursday’s victory cannot be understated. Cricket is far from a mainstream sport in the US, while Pakistan possesses significant cricketing pedigree, reaching the T20 World Cup final in 2022 and winning the competition in 2009. “Of course, beating Pakistan in the World Cup is going to open many doors for us,” said Patel. “Obviously, hosting the World Cup in USA and performing here as a team, it helps us to grow the cricket in USA.” Pakistan is ranked No. 6 in the world while the US team is No. 18. Nitish Kumar hit a match-saving boundary to force the Super Over – a tie-breaking method in which whoever scores the most runs from six balls wins – much to the delight of US fans at the Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium. In the tie-breaking over, the United States posted a competitive score of 18 runs. The US was led by bowler Saurabh Netravalkar, who took the ball in the Super Over and limited Pakistan’s batters to 13 runs, securing the win. It has been a remarkable journey for Netravalkar, a software engineer at Oracle. He was born in Mumbai but moved to the US to pursue a Master’s degree in computer engineering, graduating from Cornell University in New York, per ESPN. He played cricket recreationally after moving to the US, eventually making his debut for the national side, which he has previously captained, in 2019. He plays domestically for the Washington Freedom in Major League Cricket. The US, which won its opening game against Canada and is currently top of Group A with four points, has two more group-stage games remaining, against India and Ireland. Remaining atop the group would see the US advance to the Super 8 knockout round at the first time of asking. India, also in Group A and a pre-tournament favorite, will take on Pakistan in New York on Sunday.",u cricket team orchestrated shocking defeat powerhouse pakistan following dramatic super victory men cricket world cup thursday dallas thrilling win biggest u cricket history already regarded one biggest upset sport team captain monank patel named player match spoke landmark victory meant team country happy win playing pakistan first time world cup beating unbelievable performance side told reporter match would say big day team usa usa cricket community added united state making first appearance world cup cohosting tournament first time along west indie magnitude thursday victory understated cricket far mainstream sport u pakistan posse significant cricketing pedigree reaching world cup final winning competition course beating pakistan world cup going open many door u said patel obviously hosting world cup usa performing team help u grow cricket usa pakistan ranked world u team nitish kumar hit matchsaving boundary force super tiebreaking method whoever score run six ball win much delight u fan grand prairie cricket stadium tiebreaking united state posted competitive score run u led bowler saurabh netravalkar took ball super limited pakistan batter run securing win remarkable journey netravalkar software engineer oracle born mumbai moved u pursue master degree computer engineering graduating cornell university new york per espn played cricket recreationally moving u eventually making debut national side previously captained play domestically washington freedom major league cricket u opening game canada currently top group four point two groupstage game remaining india ireland remaining atop group would see u advance super knockout round first time asking india also group pretournament favorite take pakistan new york sunday,62.0,positive,0
cnn,Opinion: Will America finally warm to the ‘most subtle and sophisticated’ sport?,"Jun 7, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/06/opinions/t20-cricket-world-cup-india-pakistan-new-york-ravinran/index.html,"For one morning on June 9, 2024, the eyes of the cricketing world will fall on a public park on Long Island, New York. India and Pakistan will take on each other in the Men’s T20 World Cup. Don’t worry. Tickets are still available for a mere $2,500 to $10,000 (other matches start at $200). Just as cricket is the second most-watched sport in the world, India-Pakistan matches are some of the most-viewed sporting events globally. But there’s much more to cricket in America than the India-Pakistan rivalry. The fact that the US is co-hosting the World Cup for the first time, with the Caribbean, should be seen as a coming-of-age for what has been a neglected sport here. Now the cricket world wants to know: Is the sport settling in for a long stay at the crease, or is this just a flashy little cameo? In other words, can cricket ever take root in mainstream America? Beyond the glamor of this international tournament and cricket officialdom, there is another America; one where cricket has been thriving organically for years, nurtured by South Asian and Caribbean immigrants. When I moved to New York in 2012, I didn’t expect to find much cricket here. My own cricket career peaked when I represented Singapore at the Under-13 level and ended after a forgettable stint for my Oxford college. But I soon realized that one of the unexpected pleasures of cricket in America was seeing the sport bloom between the cracks. I met groups of brown and Black immigrant teens who’d been separated from their greatest passion but found ingenious ways to play it: on pot-holed, trash-strewn fields, in public parks and empty parking lots. I realized I had a lot in common with these teens. Growing up as a diasporic Indian kid in Chinese-majority Singapore, cricket gave me a sense of identity and connection to my Indian heritage. Cricket has fared better in Singapore than in the US, though it’s nowhere as popular there as say, soccer or rugby. In Singapore, cricket training was where the brown kids often found each other, and where I found the vast cricket universe, complete with its own myths, heroes, laws and language. Silly mid-off? Fine leg? Years later, I saw cricket providing a similar sense of identity for these teens in New York. It was a connection to their lives back home, and to the new ones they were forging in New York. “Cricket here is not just a sport. It’s a way for me to hold on to my culture while finding a community I can rely on,” Tanvir Ahmed, a young Bangladeshi cricketer based in Brooklyn, told me. Through their eyes, the New York cricket world continued to bloom in front of me. I discovered weekend leagues, a high school league and peculiarly, the NYPD Youth Cricket League — the subject of my upcoming feature documentary. Past the US Open tennis courts and the Citi Field baseball stadium, in a small section of Corona Park, Queens, the NYPD has been organizing a youth summer cricket league since 2008. Created to rebuild trust with the Muslim community after 9/11, the league became a surprise hit due to pent-up demand amongst immigrant teens, desperate to play their favorite sport in a country that cared little for it. The American cricket community, who’ve been slogging uphill for years, are seeing progress in other parts of the country, too. Last year, Grand Prairie in Texas and Morrisville in North Carolina co-hosted the inaugural Major League Cricket season. This year there’s a second competition, the National Cricket League, headquartered in Dallas, home to a large South Asian community. Elsewhere, university teams filled with international students have played in the American College Cricket league since 2008. And Fort Lauderhill in Florida, with its large Guyanese, Trinidadian and Jamaican expat population, has hosted three India-West Indies series since 2016. Still, cricket remains an oddity to most Americans. Cricket lovers here are often forced onto the back foot when trying to explain it. We’re tempted to invoke the game’s longer history in the US, the well-known immigrant refrain of “we’ve been here longer than you think.” Sports journalists have joined our voices this week, reminding readers that the first international cricket match took place in New York between the US and Canada in 1844. We fans lament that cricket was played widely until, during the Civil War, it was defeated by baseball, its own protégé. We simplify the game’s intricacies, hoping to be accepted, to be understood. I admit I’ve told Americans some version of the following: Cricket is baseball’s more excitable, older cousin, in which the bowler hurls the ball against the ground on its way to the batter, who then scores runs by sprinting back and forth in straight lines, rather than around a diamond. And then there’s T20 cricket, the shortest version of the game designed for big hits and the format for the World Cup happening this June. “It doesn’t last 5 days! T20 takes 3 hours!” we diehards insist. But if cricket is, in Indian historian and intellectual Ramachandra Guha’s words, the most “subtle and sophisticated game known to humankind,” what chance of mass appeal does it have in the land of slam dunks and the Super Bowl? Quite a bit, the World Cup organizers hope. The US is “a massive market… and part of the objective is to grow the sport”, said tournament director Fawwaz Baksh. They’ve enlisted some big names to their cause. Usain Bolt is a tournament ambassador. Sean Paul sang the theme song. Local news teams have marveled at the temporary, purpose-built 34,000-person stadium in Eisenhower Park, Long Island — after backlash forced it to move from its originally proposed Bronx location. In Manhattan, live screenings of World Cup matches are taking place next to One World Trade Center, where a fan zone has been built. Giant 400-pound, eight-foot tall replicas of the official T20 World Cup cricket ball have landed in Times Square, Dallas and the Greater Fort Lauderdale area. At the Bangladesh vs. India warm-up last Saturday, the first match played in the brand-new Long Island stadium, the crowd was unsurprisingly mostly South Asian. But I did see ‘cricketing America’ and ‘mainstream America’ co-exist briefly. Two Bangladeshi brothers admitted to me there that they’d signed up for stadium security jobs so they could watch their country play on US soil for the first time — for free! On the other hand, a solitary Yankees fan at his first cricket match, was telling people he hoped the next game he attends would be more of a nail-biter. Although cricket will officially be part of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, it’s no shock that winning over America at large will be tough. Meanwhile, the initial public ballot for the India-Pakistan match was “more than 200 times over-subscribed,” according to organizers, and there were over 6 million ticket requests for the tournament. It remains to be seen how many new converts will be found among the cricket faithful who are flocking to stadiums in Texas, Florida and New York this summer. But after facing years of head-scratching and raised eyebrows in the US, this June the cricket diaspora strikes back.",one morning june eye cricketing world fall public park long island new york india pakistan take men world cup dont worry ticket still available mere match start cricket second mostwatched sport world indiapakistan match mostviewed sporting event globally there much cricket america indiapakistan rivalry fact u cohosting world cup first time caribbean seen comingofage neglected sport cricket world want know sport settling long stay crease flashy little cameo word cricket ever take root mainstream america beyond glamor international tournament cricket officialdom another america one cricket thriving organically year nurtured south asian caribbean immigrant moved new york didnt expect find much cricket cricket career peaked represented singapore level ended forgettable stint oxford college soon realized one unexpected pleasure cricket america seeing sport bloom crack met group brown black immigrant teen whod separated greatest passion found ingenious way play potholed trashstrewn field public park empty parking lot realized lot common teen growing diasporic indian kid chinesemajority singapore cricket gave sense identity connection indian heritage cricket fared better singapore u though nowhere popular say soccer rugby singapore cricket training brown kid often found found vast cricket universe complete myth hero law language silly midoff fine leg year later saw cricket providing similar sense identity teen new york connection life back home new one forging new york cricket sport way hold culture finding community rely tanvir ahmed young bangladeshi cricketer based brooklyn told eye new york cricket world continued bloom front discovered weekend league high school league peculiarly nypd youth cricket league subject upcoming feature documentary past u open tennis court citi field baseball stadium small section corona park queen nypd organizing youth summer cricket league since created rebuild trust muslim community league became surprise hit due pentup demand amongst immigrant teen desperate play favorite sport country cared little american cricket community whove slogging uphill year seeing progress part country last year grand prairie texas morrisville north carolina cohosted inaugural major league cricket season year there second competition national cricket league headquartered dallas home large south asian community elsewhere university team filled international student played american college cricket league since fort lauderhill florida large guyanese trinidadian jamaican expat population hosted three indiawest indie series since still cricket remains oddity american cricket lover often forced onto back foot trying explain tempted invoke game longer history u wellknown immigrant refrain weve longer think sport journalist joined voice week reminding reader first international cricket match took place new york u canada fan lament cricket played widely civil war defeated baseball protg simplify game intricacy hoping accepted understood admit ive told american version following cricket baseball excitable older cousin bowler hurl ball ground way batter score run sprinting back forth straight line rather around diamond there cricket shortest version game designed big hit format world cup happening june doesnt last day take hour diehard insist cricket indian historian intellectual ramachandra guhas word subtle sophisticated game known humankind chance mass appeal land slam dunk super bowl quite bit world cup organizer hope u massive market part objective grow sport said tournament director fawwaz baksh theyve enlisted big name cause usain bolt tournament ambassador sean paul sang theme song local news team marveled temporary purposebuilt person stadium eisenhower park long island backlash forced move originally proposed bronx location manhattan live screening world cup match taking place next one world trade center fan zone built giant pound eightfoot tall replica official world cup cricket ball landed time square dallas greater fort lauderdale area bangladesh v india warmup last saturday first match played brandnew long island stadium crowd unsurprisingly mostly south asian see cricketing america mainstream america coexist briefly two bangladeshi brother admitted theyd signed stadium security job could watch country play u soil first time free hand solitary yankee fan first cricket match telling people hoped next game attends would nailbiter although cricket officially part los angeles olympics shock winning america large tough meanwhile initial public ballot indiapakistan match time oversubscribed according organizer million ticket request tournament remains seen many new convert found among cricket faithful flocking stadium texas florida new york summer facing year headscratching raised eyebrow u june cricket diaspora strike back,36.0,positive,0
cnn,India wants to be the next China. Half of its population holds the key,"Jun 6, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/05/economy/india-election-economy-challenges-women-intl-hnk/index.html,"India, the world’s fastest growing major economy, is not firing on all cylinders. That’s a problem for Narendra Modi, who has just won a third consecutive five-year term as prime minister, although without a simple majority. The 73-year-old wants to make the country a $5 trillion economy before the end of the current decade. His plans for reform have been complicated by the narrower-than-expected election victory, and there are major challenges ahead. One entrenched problem standing in the way of India’s superpower ambitions is the lack of jobs for hundreds of millions of citizens, particularly women. There are over 460 million women of working age in India — more than the entire population of the European Union — and they are more educated, aspirational and healthier than any previous generation. But their dreams are clashing against a harsh reality. Take Gunasri Tamilselvan, 22, who fears having to quit the job that she loves. The engineering graduate started working at Finnish electronics manufacturer Salcomp’s factory in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu last year. Tamilselvan is part of a sought-after team making mobile chargers for major smartphone brands, but she has had to fight both at home and at work for her right to be financially independent. And now, she is running out of time. Her family wants to arrange a marriage for her as soon as possible. In South Asia, it is still a norm for parents find spouses for their children. “My father has not been very comfortable with my work,” she told CNN. “He has given me 10 months, after which he will choose a husband for me and get me married.” If that happens, she would then have to negotiate with her husband and in-laws to continue working. It’s not the only battle she wants to win. At the factory, she says she often works much harder to prove to her male colleagues that she deserves her place in the automation department, which involves dealing with the latest machinery. Only about one-third of India’s working age women are active in the labor force, according to the World Bank, much lower than the global average of around 50%. As a result, the country is missing out on billions of dollars. The World Bank said in 2018 that India could boost its rate of economic growth to 9% per year if around 50% of women were in the work force. (The economy grew by 8.2% in the fiscal year that ended in March.) During Modi’s 10 years in power, India has jumped four spots to become the world’s fifth largest economy, and analysts are confident that his government can turn the country into an economic superpower, behind only the United States and China by 2027. This historic opportunity for India comes at a time when China is struggling with an unprecedented economic slump, and the world is looking for a new growth engine. Western manufacturers are also keen to diversify their supply chains. But there are also fears that India might miss out. According to McKinsey, the contribution of women to India’s GDP is only 18%, one of the lowest proportions in the world. This is in stark contrast with China, where for several decades, women have been powerful players in the economic boom. Job creation, particularly for women, is “literally an unspoken emergency” in the country, said Chandrasekhar Sripada, a professor at the Indian School of Business, adding that “the problem is so humongous that there are no magic solutions and silver bullets.” From restrictive cultural norms to office harassment, there are many reasons why women, even when highly skilled, choose to stay at home. “Indian women spend about seven to eight hours a day minimum in unpaid work,” as most domestic and childcare duties still fall on them, said Sripada. Like India, women in China were also relegated to subordinate roles for centuries. Foot binding, which improved a woman’s marriage prospects, was perhaps the most extreme practice that limited her ability to work. But this changed drastically after the Communist Party took over the country in 1949, with Chairman Mao Zedong banning feudal marriage and advocating gender equality. “Women hold up half the sky,” Mao had declared famously. Today, they contribute over 40% to the world’s second largest economy, according to McKinsey. Over the last decade, the Modi government has introduced policies to encourage more women to join the workforce. Since 2017, the country has mandated 26 weeks of paid maternity leave, which is more than China’s 98 days. The new government is expected to try to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington. As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including major Apple (AAPL) suppliers such as Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India, and many of them are hiring women in large numbers, government officials in Tamil Nadu told CNN. According to market research firm Canalys, up to 23% of iPhones will be made in India by the end of 2025, up from 6% in 2022. Much of this change is visible in Tamil Nadu, India’s industrial powerhouse where companies such as Foxconn and Samsung have manufacturing plants. Over 40% of India’s female factory employees work in the southern state, said Vishnu Venugopalan, chief executive of Guidance Tamil Nadu, the state’s investment promotion agency. India’s most valuable conglomerate, the 156-year-old salt-to-software Tata Group, is also trying to improve diversity at its various manufacturing plants across India. One of its units, Tata Power, has built a new solar cell and module factory where 80% of the workers are women. Deepesh Nanda, the president of renewables at Tata Power, told CNN that while it can be difficult at times to improve diversity in an “existing setup,” having a “clean slate” helped the company set a benchmark. The facility, located in Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu, is hiring workers largely from the local community, to make it easier for the many Indian women who still prefer to live with their parents or spouses to apply. To get these women to enter and stay in the workforce, the company is offering benefits ranging from affordable housing to cabs with security guards. Such benefits are crucial as India is considered to be one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a women because of the high risk of sexual violence and slave labor. Parameshwari J, a chemistry graduate who is a trainee at the Tata plant, said she would have thought twice about taking the position if she had to relocate to a new city, because of concerns ranging from safety to language barriers. Like many of her peers, the 26-year-old, who recently got married, had to seek her family’s approval to work. “When I decided to get married, I told my in-laws that I will work and I need to be independent,” she told CNN. The Tamil Nadu government is building vast housing projects for women workers to provide safe and hygienic accommodation and support the state’s burgeoning smartphone manufacturing ecosystem. Two of those projects, accommodating over 36,000 women, will be occupied by Foxconn workers, while another with a capacity of 11,000 will be taken by a Tata Group company, said Arun Roy, the state’s industries secretary. In China, migrant workers often live in sprawling dormitories provided by companies, and such arrangements have been instrumental in making the country the world’s factory. Foxconn’s facility in Zhengzhou in central China, the world’s largest iPhone factory, normally houses some 200,000 workers. India may not be able to set up such gigantic facilities. “It is difficult to replicate the Chinese model fully as their scale is massive,” said Roy. “That kind of land acquisition is not easy in India.” The dormitory culture may not take off in a big way for other reasons too. “Migration is painful,” said Sripada. “We should plan for less migration. We should plan for more decentralized economy.” Tamil Nadu says it has done exactly that, which is part of the reason why it has so many women in its workforce. “The manufacturing clusters in the state are not just in large cities,” said Venugopalan. “There’s a fair amount of distribution regionally, which means you don’t need to look at large scale migration of people into one single growth center.”",india world fastest growing major economy firing cylinder thats problem narendra modi third consecutive fiveyear term prime minister although without simple majority yearold want make

cnn,"Opinion: For Indian Muslims like me, an unshakable feeling of doom","Jun 5, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/05/opinions/india-election-modi-indian-muslims-salam/index.html,"It has not been easy being a Muslim in Narendra Modi’s India. With the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) steadfastly refusing to allow my community even a token representation in corridors of power, India’s largest minority, the third largest Muslim population in the world, is left voiceless. For the first time since India’s Independence in 1947, the ruling party did not have a single Muslim Member of Parliament. Tuesday’s election results, in which Prime Minister Modi sealed a rare third term, only enhance the sense of gloom and doom for Indian Muslims like me. My community may once again not have an MP in the government. With the BJP back in power – albeit without the supermajority it had vowed – my only hope lies in a politically weakened Modi now. A weakened Modi shall, hopefully, translate into a more robust India and more secure minorities. It may still be a long haul though. After the recently concluded, hate-driven campaign led by Modi himself, things may only get worse. As it was before the vote, India is poised to continue transforming itself from a secular democratic republic into possibly a Hindu majoritarian state, with reduced rights and presence of minorities in general – and of Muslims in particular. If after Modi’s first victory in 2014, there was a sense of cautious hope, 10 years later, my Muslim community stands orphaned, not just jettisoned by the ruling BJP, but repeatedly marked out as the group responsible for the supposed ills of the nation. There is an overriding feeling of belonging to a group under siege. The prime minister kickstarted the invidious campaign by calling India’s 200 million Muslims “infiltrators” in one of his early election speeches. His vitriol was, to put it mildly, unprovoked; the state of Rajasthan where he delivered his divisive speech has a strongly guarded border with Muslim-majority Pakistan. The state has only sent one Muslim candidate to the Lok Sabha – the Lower House of Parliament – since the first election back in 1952. In this year’s election, the two leading political parties, the BJP and the Indian National Congress (INC or, simply, “Congress”), did not give a ticket to a single Muslim to contest the elections in Rajasthan. Yet the invisible Muslim ghost was punched with relish by Modi. It’s worth remembering this is the man who, back in 2002, was the Chief Minister of the state of Gujarat when large-scale violence claimed over 1,000 lives, a vast majority of them Muslims. (Modi denied any wrongdoing, and the Supreme Court cleared him of complicity). But let us return to 2024. As the 6-week-long election wore on, Modi mocked the Muslim community’s supposed high fertility rate and repeatedly targeted the community using the opposition – especially Congress – as a mere pretext, accusing it of reserving 15% of the Union Budget for Indian Muslims. (Congress rejected the claim). Of course, Modi denied discriminating against Muslims, and in a widely televised interview claimed to have celebrated the Muslim festival of Eid with his friends. Meanwhile the Islamophobia within the BJP hit a new low when the party’s promotional video showed caricatures of Congress party leaders placing an egg marked “Muslims” in a nest next to three eggs marked “SC,” “OBC” and “ST” (three lower caste groups). As the eggs hatch, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is shown feeding “funds” to the chick wearing a skullcap while ignoring the other chickens. The allusion was not lost on anyone. The video ran for days on social media before the Election Commission wrote to Twitter to take action. Muslims stood silenced by the unceasing vitriol. Some were intimidated. Others hoped the election would bring an end to BJP rule. It proved a false hope. The BJP’s much-hyped claim of getting over 400 seats in the Lower House of Parliament did not materialize. The party, in the end, needed help from allies, Telugu Desam and Janata Dal (United), to form a government for the third time in succession – a feat hitherto performed only by the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s Congress immediately after Independence. Except for one candidate in the constituency of Kerala, the BJP refused to put up Muslim candidates. This had an unfortunate ripple effect with the number of Muslims getting tickets from other parties showing a decline. The main opposition party, Congress, failed to put up a Muslim candidate in the capital, New Delhi, as well as in the commercial center Mumbai and in Mahatma Gandhi’s home state, Gujarat. In fact, the number of Muslim candidates put up by major political parties showed a steep decline, falling from 115 in the 2019 elections, to 78 in 2024. In the days and months to come, things could get seriously tough for Indian Muslims. With the prime minister failing to condemn the frequent lynching of Muslim men by right-wing vigilantes since 2015, and state governments ruled by the BJP using bulldozers to demolish Muslim establishments as a means of cowing even the odd voice of protest, it is going to be a question of survival for my community. Our food habits, clothing, education centers and places of worship are all likely to be under greater scrutiny, possibly even violent attacks in the days of come. Already, medieval Indian mosques, some as old as 900 years, are being contested by Hindu outfits in various courts. There have been noises that the world-famous Taj Mahal was originally a Hindu temple, and that the historic Qutb Minar in Delhi was built after demolition of temples. A community which has seen the 16th century mosque, the Babri Masjid, become a Hindu temple during Modi’s second term has reason to fear the worst. We’ve seen BJP leaders talking of closing Islamic seminaries across the states of Uttar Pradesh and Assam. In the state of Uttarakhand, a hurriedly cobbled together Uniform Civil Code is in place – essentially a single set of laws for all residents that does not take into account the customs or religious laws of different religions or minority groups. It could be the norm for the rest of India soon as the BJP tries to deny Indian Muslims the right to follow Islamic laws in civil matters, a right granted by the Indian Constitution. With Hindu Rashtra a virtual reality, it is difficult to see a silver lining for Indian Muslims who chose pluralist India over the theocratic state of Pakistan at the time of Independence.

cnn,‘Still a strong story.’ Why India’s election shock won’t derail its economic boom,"Jun 5, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/05/business/india-economy-what-next-intl-hnk/index.html,"Narendra Modi has declared victory in India’s election but he’ll need the support of smaller parties to govern, a shock result that could make it harder for him to pass major economic reforms. India boomed during Modi’s first two terms as prime minister, leapfrogging the United Kingdom to become the world’s fifth biggest economy and growing by 8.2% in the last fiscal year. But the new government will need to make more big changes to sustain that pace if India is to become an economic superpower and a manufacturing rival to China. “With a more fragmented government, we believe policy making in general is going to become more difficult going forward,” said Peeyush Mittal, a portfolio manager at Matthews Asia, a San Francisco-based investment fund. Experts have highlighted land reform as an example of policies that might now be tougher for Modi to implement. Companies face more barriers to accessing land in India than in China. It is also much harder to hire or fire workers. India will need to address those issues if it is to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington. Some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple (AAPL) supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India. But while the country has emerged as a major hub for electronics manufacturing, it is still lagging behind China in sectors such as clothing, toys and furniture. Despite the surprise electoral setback for Modi’s right-wing, Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), experts say the world’s fastest growing major economy will continue to live up to its billing. “The Modi administration still has enough of a mandate to enact reforms that will keep potential growth at 6% to 7%,” Shilan Shah, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a note on Tuesday. “That would leave the economy on course to more than double in size over the next decade.” The BJP fell short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners. The party’s underperformance led to a plunge on India’s stock market, which had its worst day in four years Tuesday. Investors had been hoping for a strong, business-friendly government and had sent stocks to record highs Monday after weekend exit polls suggested Modi was on track for a bigger win. But analysts say that the next government will still be strong enough to ensure India becomes a global growth engine and remain an attractive destination for investors and companies. On Wednesday, stocks were up 3% The Indian economy is poised to become the world’s third largest behind only the United States and China before the end of this decade. “The lack of absolute majority doesn’t derail this broad economic agenda envisaged by the BJP,” said Aditya Suresh, head of India equity research at Macquarie Capital. In the long-term, he sees the government focusing on job creation, manufacturing and “improving ease of doing business.” India’s so-called “demographic dividend,” the potential economic growth arising from a large working-age population, represents a major opportunity. Its vast consumer market and pool of affordable labor should continue to draw more attention from global brands and trading partners. Asia’s third biggest economy will also benefit from friend-shoring, a trade practice where supply chains are moved through allies, said Shah. While tensions between Beijing and the US are rising, New Delhi enjoys warm relations with Western nations. Modi’s government has overseen a construction boom, spending billions building roads, railways and airports. Apart from that physical infrastructure, India has also built a range of public digital platforms, including the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), that have transformed lives and businesses and should continue to aid with economic expansion.

cnn,Modi declares victory in India election but party faces shock losses and will need coalition,"Jun 5, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/04/india/india-election-modi-victory-declaration-intl-hnk/index.html,"India’s transformative yet divisive Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Tuesday evening, but his goal of winning an unassailable majority was left in tatters after voters delivered a shock result that reduced the extent of his party’s grip on power. “Today is a glorious day… National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to form the government for the third time, we are grateful to the people,” Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New Delhi, referring to the initials of his political alliance. “This is a victory for the world’s largest democracy.” Modi is set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies – a third consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India. But Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party fell short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners to form a government. Modi’s NDA alliance won 292 seats combined, out of which his BJP alone secured 240. This is a personal blow to Modi, who had triumphantly vowed to win a 400-seat supermajority in this year’s election – and romped to victory the last two contests with a simple majority for the BJP, turning his Hindu nationalist right-wing party into an electoral juggernaut. India’s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi’s divisive style. Rahul Gandhi, the leader of India’s National Congress, said early election results showed that the “country has unanimously and clearly” stated that it does not want Modi and his party to run the country. “We do not appreciate the way they have run this country for the last 10 years so that is a huge message for Mr. Narendra Modi,” he said outside his party’s headquarters in New Delhi. Congress led an alliance of opposition parties that tried to topple Modi. While they look set to have failed in that task, they have dented his previous aura of electoral invincibility. Results also show they have chipped away at BJP seats, including in some of the ruling party’s traditional strongholds. Meanwhile Indian stocks plunged Tuesday as Modi’s dream of a landslide victory slipped away, raising doubts about his ability to push through more aggressive economic reforms. From April 19 to June 1, more than 640 million people cast their vote at polling stations across the country, from the high peaks of the Himalayas to the remote jungles of the west. And though turnout slightly dipped from the record levels of 2019, that a democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity. To his millions of supporters in the Hindu majority nation, 73-year-old Modi is an icon whose policies have transformed ordinary people’s lives and helped realize the nascent promise of social mobility in a country still riven by class divide. “No one can do for us what our Prime Minister Modi can,” said BJP worker Rajgopal Kashyap, from the party’s headquarters in New Delhi. “He has come to us as an instrument of God. He will take our country forward and is the only one who can run the country.” Over the last decade his administration has upgraded the country’s aging transport network, building highways to connect small villages with major cities. He has overseen the development of new power plants and maritime projects and, according to recent remarks from Modi himself, subsidized the construction of some 40 million concrete homes for improvised families. At his rallies, tens of thousands gather in religious devotion to glimpse a man they hope never loses his grip on power. Modi’s face is plastered on buses and billboards across the country, and his voice enters the homes of millions every month via his flagship radio program and increasingly pliant media landscape. But his decade in power has not been without controversy. Modi faced widespread criticism early in his tenure when he banned India’s 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes, deeming them “worthless pieces of paper,” sparking panic in the cash heavy economy. In 2019, he faced the wrath of angry farmers when they took to the streets to demand guaranteed prices for their crops in the biggest protests the country has ever seen. Two years later, critics blamed him for mismanaging the country’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to more than half a million deaths, according to official figures. Religious persecution and Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s Hindu-nationalist dreams. They say the prime minister is dragging India away from the constitutionally secular roots and transforming India into a majoritarian Hindu state, an evolution with potentially profound implications in a giant nation with a troubled history of explosive inter-communal violence. Given India’s strategic position in Asia and its booming economy, Modi’s victory will reverberate far beyond its borders, capturing the attention of the United States, China and Russia in particular. Washington has long seen New Delhi as a regional crucial bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. But at the same time India remains close to Moscow and has thirstily snapped up cheap Russian oil despite the invasion of Ukraine and western-led sanctions. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047, the centenary of independence from colonial British rule. He inherited a rising economy and India’s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce. But that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with youth unemployment spiraling and much of the country’s growing wealth distributed unequally. Despite his reduced mandate, supporters say Modi remains the best person to deliver on those economic promises and cement the country’s rank as a major global player. “For us middle-class people, (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) is the only one who has done anything, who has shined India’s name abroad,” said Surjeet Singh, a driver in New Delhi. Political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot says such sentiment “can be seen across the board.” There’s a feeling that Modi makes Indians “proud again,” said Jaffrelot. “There is a sense in India of vulnerability, lack of self-esteem. So, to be recognized as a great power despite everything is attributed to him.” This breaking news story has been updated.",india transformative yet divisive prime minister narendra modi declared victory national election tuesday evening goal winning unassailable majority left tatter voter delivered shock result reduced extent party grip power today glorious day national democratic alliance nda going form government third time grateful people modi told cheering supporter party headquarters new delhi referring initial political alliance victory world largest democracy modi set form government help nda ally third consecutive term landmark make one successful politician postindependence india modis ruling bharatiya janata party fell short securing seat needed win outright majority parliament stunning upset leaf reliant coalition partner form government modis nda alliance seat combined bjp alone secured personal blow modi triumphantly vowed win seat supermajority year election romped victory last two contest simple majority bjp turning hindu nationalist rightwing party electoral juggernaut india opposition largely written poll many analyst portrayed result rejection modis divisive style rahul gandhi leader india national congress said early election result showed country unanimously clearly stated want modi party run country appreciate way run country last year huge message mr narendra modi said outside party headquarters new delhi congress led alliance opposition party tried topple modi look set failed task dented previous aura electoral invincibility result also show chipped away bjp seat including ruling party traditional stronghold meanwhile indian stock plunged tuesday modis dream landslide victory slipped away raising doubt ability push aggressive economic reform april june million people cast vote polling station across country high peak himalaya remote jungle west though turnout slightly dipped record level democratically elected leader third term speaks level popularity million supporter hindu majority nation yearold modi icon whose policy transformed ordinary people life helped realize nascent promise social mobility country still riven class divide one u prime minister modi said bjp worker rajgopal kashyap party headquarters new delhi come u instrument god take country forward one run country last decade administration upgraded country aging transport network building highway connect small village major city overseen development new power plant maritime project according recent remark modi subsidized construction million concrete home improvised family rally ten thousand gather religious devotion glimpse man hope never loses grip power modis face plastered bus billboard across country voice enters home million every month via flagship radio program increasingly pliant medium landscape decade power without controversy modi faced widespread criticism early tenure banned india rupee bank note deeming worthless piece paper sparking panic cash heavy economy faced wrath angry farmer took street demand guaranteed price crop biggest protest country ever seen two year later critic blamed mismanaging country response covid pandemic led half million death according official figure religious persecution islamophobia also increased sharply watch critic accusing tacitly endorsing sectarianism bolster party hindunationalist dream say prime minister dragging india away constitutionally secular root transforming india majoritarian hindu state evolution potentially profound implication giant nation troubled history explosive intercommunal violence given india strategic position asia booming economy modis victory reverberate far beyond border capturing attention united state china russia particular washington long seen new delhi regional crucial bulwark increasingly assertive china time india remains close moscow thirstily snapped cheap russian oil despite invasion ukraine westernled sanction modi set sight deepening transformation india goal turning vast country developed nation centenary independence colonial british rule inherited rising economy india growth remains impressive filled populous young workforce workforce also chronically underemployed youth unemployment spiraling much country growing wealth distributed unequally despite reduced mandate supporter say modi remains best person deliver economic promise cement country rank major global player u middleclass people prime minister narendra modi one done anything shined india name abroad said surjeet singh driver new delhi political scientist christophe jaffrelot say sentiment seen across board there feeling modi make indian proud said jaffrelot sense india vulnerability lack selfesteem recognized great power despite everything attributed breaking news story updated,44.0,positive,2

India’s benchmark Sensex index, which tracks 30 large companies, and the broader Nifty 50 index each closed down by nearly 6%. The worst daily drop for Indian stocks since 2020 came just 24 hours after both indexes hit record highs as weekend exit polls prompted experts to predict a resounding victory for Modi. The world’s biggest election concluded on Saturday. The 73-year-old ran on his economic record over the past 10 years, a period of robust growth for India. His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was aiming to win a 400-seat supermajority in the 543-seat lower house of parliament, but preliminary results show the opposition Congress party is performing better than some analysts expected. A party or a coalition needs 272 seats to form a government. In India’s last election in 2019, the BJP won 303 seats. If the final results confirm that Modi has underperformed in the polls, key economic reforms may be put on the back burner. “The (early) election results are showing a less than halfway mark (272 seats) for the current BJP government, pointing towards a coalition government,” said Yashovardhan Khemka, Senior Manager, Research & Analytics at Mumbai-based asset management firm Abans Holdings. “This will lead to dependence on allies in making key policy decision… which will lead to policy paralysis and uncertainty in the government’s functioning,” he added. India is the world’s fastest growing major economy and is comfortably placed to expand at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, but analysts say it needs to achieve growth of 8% or more if it wants to become an economic superpower. Sustained expansion would push India higher up the ranks of the world’s biggest economies, with some observers forecasting the country to become number three behind only the United States and China by 2027. The country’s stock markets have performed well during Modi’s tenure. Earlier this year, the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) overtook both the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Exchange to become the world’s sixth largest bourse, data from the World Federation of Exchanges showed. But investors have complained about the high price of Indian stocks and some analysts believe a correction could be healthy for markets.

cnn,Who will lead India? World’s largest nation begins a mammoth day of vote counting after weeks-long election,"Jun 4, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/03/india/india-general-election-vote-counting-day-intl-hnk/index.html,"Hundreds of millions of votes cast, more than six weeks of polling, and billions of dollars spent: India on Tuesday will declare a new leader after a mammoth nationwide election that has become a referendum on the last decade of leadership by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. His powerful right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had set out to win a supermajority in the lower house of parliament – or Lok Sabha – a goal which, if successful, would give it an unstoppable mandate to further enshrine its Hindu-nationalist agenda, deepening India’s move away from its secular foundations. But as preliminary results began rolling in throughout Tuesday, that ambitious goal appeared to be at risk, with the main opposition Indian National Congress performing better than some analysts expected — despite the BJP still in a comfortable lead. For real-time election results and analysis, follow CNN’s live coverage here. Given India’s strategic position in Asia and its booming economy, the election result will reverberate far beyond its borders, capturing the attention of the United States, China and Russia in particular. Some 642 million people cast their vote in the world’s largest election, as swathes of the country was blanketed in searing heat, making people sick and killing dozens. Hoping to unseat India’s charismatic but divisive leader is an alliance of more than two dozen parties, led by the Congress party, which is running on a platform of reducing inequality and upholding democratic institutions which it argues are at risk. Since assuming power in 2014, Modi has attained levels of popularity not seen in decades, owing to a raft of development and welfare programs, mixed with a strident brand of Hindu nationalism in a country where about 80% of the population are followers of the polytheistic faith. Under Modi’s leadership, the country of 1.4 billion people has become the world’s fastest-growing major economy and a modern global power, making strides in technology and space. Yet, despite these successes, poverty and youth unemployment persist – particularly in rural areas – and the wealth gap has widened. Critics also say a decade of Modi’s governance has led to growing religious polarization, with Islamophobia marginalizing much of the country’s more than 200 million Muslims, and religious violence flaring up in a nation with a long history of communal tensions. Polling began on April 19 and ended on June 1. Nearly 1 billion Indians were eligible to vote for 543 seats in the lower house of parliament. The leader of the party that wins a majority will become prime minister and form a ruling government. Modi has set an ambitious target of securing a 400-seat supermajority, with 370 directly controlled by his BJP – up from 303 in 2019 – and the others from its National Democratic Alliance. His BJP centered its manifesto on job creation and anti-poverty programs, with a focus on women, the poor and farmers. He’s promised to turn India into a developed nation by 2047 and transform the country into a global manufacturing hub. Yet, on the campaign trail, he has been accused of deploying openly divisive rhetoric that has been condemned as Islamophobic, while casting himself as an instrument chosen by God. Modi sparked a row over hate speech when he accused Muslims – who have been part of India for centuries – of being “infiltrators,” and echoing a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists that Muslims are displacing the country’s Hindu population by deliberately having large families. His BJP released several political videos targeting Muslims, one of which is under investigation by police. Congress has governed India for much of its independent history, having been instrumental in ending nearly 200 years of British colonial rule. But over the last decade, it has struggled to find relevance – partly due to a series of corruption scandals and infighting – unable to break through Modi’s popularity. Rahul Gandhi, the son of the famed Gandhi dynasty, is the face of the party but lost the past two elections to Modi. He is contending once again from the southern state of Kerala and the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh in the north, also India’s most populous. Opposition leaders and parties have faced a slew of legal and financial challenges in the run-up to this year’s election, with many accusing the BJP of using state agencies to stifle opponents. The arrest in March of the popular Aam Aadmi Party leader, chief minister of Delhi and staunch Modi critic Arvind Kejriwal sparked protests in the capital and prompted claims of a political “conspiracy” by his party – claims the BJP has denied. Kejriwal’s release on interim bail last month galvanized the opposition to put up a tough fight against the BJP, uniting a group of political leaders who were once divided over ideological differences. The Congress’ manifesto has also been dubbed one of India’s most progressive, pledging “freedom from fear” and vowing to protect freedom of speech, expression and religious belief espoused in the constitution. Turnout across all seven phases has slightly dipped from the record highs of 2019, yet India’s general election remains the largest exercise in democracy, with hundreds of millions showing up to determine who will lead the world’s most populous country.",hundred million vote cast six week polling billion dollar spent india tuesday declare new leader mammoth nationwide election become referendum last decade leadership prime minister narendra modi powerful rightwing bharatiya janata party bjp set win supermajority lower house parliament lok sabha goal successful would give unstoppable mandate enshrine hindunationalist agenda deepening india move away secular foundation preliminary result began rolling throughout tuesday ambitious goal appeared risk main opposition indian national congress performing better analyst expected despite bjp still comfortable lead realtime election result analysis follow cnns live coverage given india strategic position asia booming economy election result reverberate far beyond border capturing attention united state china russia particular million people cast vote world largest election swathe country blanketed searing heat making people sick killing dozen hoping unseat india charismatic divisive leader alliance two dozen party led congress party running platform reducing inequality upholding democratic institution argues risk since assuming power modi attained level popularity seen decade owing raft development welfare program mixed strident brand hindu nationalism country population follower polytheistic faith modis leadership country billion people become world fastestgrowing major economy modern global power making stride technology space yet despite success poverty youth unemployment persist particularly rural area wealth gap widened critic also say decade modis governance led growing religious polarization islamophobia marginalizing much country million muslim religious violence flaring nation long history communal tension polling began april ended june nearly billion indian eligible vote seat lower house parliament leader party win majority become prime minister form ruling government modi set ambitious target securing seat supermajority directly controlled bjp others national democratic alliance bjp centered manifesto job creation antipoverty program focus woman poor farmer he promised turn india developed nation transform country global manufacturing hub yet campaign trail accused deploying openly divisive rhetoric condemned islamophobic casting instrument chosen god modi sparked row hate speech accused muslim part india century infiltrator echoing false conspiracy voiced hindu nationalist muslim displacing country hindu population deliberately large family bjp released several political video targeting muslim one investigation police congress governed india much independent history instrumental ending nearly year british colonial rule last decade struggled find relevance partly due series corruption scandal infighting unable break modis popularity rahul gandhi son famed gandhi dynasty face party lost past two election modi contending southern state kerala crucial state uttar pradesh north also india populous opposition leader party faced slew legal financial challenge runup year election many accusing bjp using state agency stifle opponent arrest march popular aam aadmi party leader chief minister delhi staunch modi critic arvind kejriwal sparked protest capital prompted claim political conspiracy party claim bjp denied kejriwals release interim bail last month galvanized opposition put tough fight bjp uniting group political leader divided ideological difference congress manifesto also dubbed one india progressive pledging freedom fear vowing protect freedom speech expression religious belief espoused constitution turnout across seven phase slightly dipped record high yet india general election remains largest exercise democracy hundred million showing determine lead world populous country,-12.0,negative,0
cnn,Dozens killed by extreme heat in India as polls close in world’s largest election,"Jun 3, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/02/india/india-heatwave-poll-worker-deaths-intl-hnk/index.html,"Extreme heat in India has killed at least 77 people over the past 10 days, including dozens of poll workers, as voting wrapped up in the world’s largest general election. India has endured a scorching summer — with a part of the capital of Delhi recording the country’s highest-ever temperature of 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 degrees Fahrenheit) on Tuesday last week — as voters have hit the polls over a six-week election. At least 33 poll workers died in a single day in India’s most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, the state’s chief election officer, Navdeep Rinwa, told reporters Sunday. Their families will receive $18,000 each in compensation, he said. Despite being fitted out with water dispensers, mist machines and shaded areas, polling stations in Delhi were unusually quiet on Saturday, the penultimate day of voting. For some, casting a ballot was not worth the risk. Others urged eligible voters to try and tolerate the heat. Standing on the sweltering streets, a Delhi resident called Haseem told CNN that voting is “a fundamental right and the foremost duty for every citizen of any republic or any democracy. We should be coming out, whatever the weather.” A woman selling lemonade on the streets of Delhi told the AFP French news agency: “The heat is so harsh here, that when the wind comes, it feels like someone is slapping your face.” With the peak of summer still weeks away, temperatures are expected to rise further. “I don’t know what we will do,” she said. Home to more than 1.4 billion people, about 969 million Indians were eligible to cast their vote in the election — more than the populations of North America and the European Union combined. Around 642 million showed up, the most ever to participate, Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar told a press conference on Monday. Voters and election workers have endured an extended period of extreme heat since polls opened on April 19, in a mammoth democratic exercise that ended Sunday. Polls suggest Prime Minister Narenda Modi will secure a rare third consecutive term in office, with results expected Tuesday. To carry out such a huge election, India relies on a network of some 15 million polling officials and security staff, with some of these election workers traveling via road, boat, camel, train and helicopter to reach citizens across the vast nation. But the event has been marred by the deaths of dozens of poll workers and voters. Some 20 people were reported dead due to “sun stroke” between May 31 and June 2 in the eastern state of Odisha, according to the state’s disaster management agency. “In Odisha we have been experiencing severe temperatures the last few days, the heat here isn’t as high as northern India but here high humidity is also a factor,” Satyabrata Sahu, Odisha’s special relief commissioner told CNN Monday. Sahu said rainfall over the weekend could reduce the heat in the coming days. Another 24 people died across the capital territory of Delhi, the eastern Indian states of Bihar and Jharkhand and the western Indian state of Rajasthan since May 24, local officials said. Election duty is compulsory in India for public sector employees, who are assigned by the election commission before polling begins. “Heat wave conditions over Northwest, Central & East India are likely to continue with reduced intensity during next 3 days,” the Indian Meteorological Department said on Sunday. India is among the countries expected to be worst affected by the climate crisis, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), threatening its development while risking reversing its progress on poverty alleviation, health and economic growth. The country often experiences heat waves during the summer months of May and June, but in recent years they have arrived earlier and become more prolonged. Experts say the climate crisis is only going to cause more frequent and longer heat waves in the future, testing India’s ability to adapt.

India’s benchmark Sensex index, which tracks 30 large companies, and the broader Nifty 50 index each ended the day at their all-time closing highs, having gained more than 3%. The surge comes after India concluded its mammoth, weeks-long election this weekend. “I can say with confidence that the people of India have voted in record numbers to reelect the … government,” Modi said on X on Saturday, shortly after polls closed. The 73-year-old ran on his economic record over the past 10 years, a period of robust growth for India. Results will be declared on Tuesday. In India’s last election in 2019, Modi’s party won 303 seats in parliament. Analysts cited multiple local exit polls that point to a much bigger Modi victory this time as the major reason for the market optimism. “With the exit polls pointing towards 370 seats mark and ahead of street expectations of 320-350 seats, markets have reacted positively,” said Manish Chowdhury, head of research at brokerage StoxBox. “We expect to see higher flows both from domestic as well as foreign investors going ahead,” he added. The surge in stocks also comes after the country posted bumper economic growth numbers on Friday. The economy expanded by more than 8% in the fiscal year that ended in March, cementing India’s status as the world’s fastest growing major economy. The country is comfortably placed to expand at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, but analysts say it needs to achieve growth of 8% or more if it wants to become an economic superpower. Investors hope that if Modi wins a big majority in parliament, his government will unleash key land and labor reforms needed for the next phase of growth. Sustained expansion will push India higher up the ranks of the world’s biggest economies, with some observers forecasting the country to become number three behind only the United States and China by 2027. Shares in ports-to-power conglomerate Adani Group also surged on Monday. Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship firm was up over 7%, while Adani Power was up 16%. Last week, its founder Gautam Adani overtook fellow countryman Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, to become Asia’s richest man once again, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Both Ambani and Adani are considered vocal champions of Modi. Adani’s rising fortunes come a year and half after his group was rocked by an unprecedented crisis when an American short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of engaging in fraud over decades. Adani denounced Hindenburg’s report as “baseless” and “malicious.” Since then, the tycoon has made a remarkable comeback, with shares in some of his companies touching record highs as investors cheer his ability to adroitly bet on sectors prioritized for development by Modi. The country’s stock markets have performed well during his tenure. The value of companies listed on India’s exchanges surpassed $4 trillion late last year.

But nothing will stop me from embracing my joy,"Jun 3, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/02/opinions/india-election-dalit-women-caste-joy-rao/index.html,"I come from India’s Dalit community of some 200 million people, a community that suffers the worst health outcomes, lacks access to clean water and sanitation and has been deprived of educational and occupational opportunities for centuries. Dalits were once contemptuously dismissed as “untouchables,” a term which today is understood to be a slur. My community of Dalit women are doubly oppressed by caste and gender. Women in my community are the most vulnerable to sexual violence in India, for example. But to say that we are only limited by our misfortunes would be misguided, and far too reductive. The Dalit woman’s experience is unique. In our daily lives, and in myriad ways, we also embrace joy. Our reality is far more complex and encompasses much more than the casteist gaze that fetishizes our pain and reduces our culture to our oppression. Dalit women like me are bound together by a sense of sisterhood woven with each other for as long as anyone can remember, and long before that. While cruelties continue to be perpetrated on us as part of India’s age-old hierarchy, we refuse to be defined by pain and oppression alone. “You don’t look Dalit” is something that I and many accomplished women from my background have heard at least once in their lives, a clueless statement fueled by the caste-influenced thinking that Dalit women are defined — even in how we look — by an eternal state of oppression. Too often, social media and news stories focus only on violent atrocities against my community. Dalit women’s achievements, success and joy are achingly sidelined. Yes, there are tragic stories about Dalits, but there are other stories about us that deserve to be told — stories about Dalit women becoming lawyers, journalists, policy analysts, engineers, athletes, fashion models, writers, civil service officers and musicians. These stories have changed my life as a young woman by offering examples of a way up and a path out, in the process altering my own trajectory. I think of my mentor, Beena Pallical, who made history by becoming the first Dalit woman to address the UN General Assembly. She has long been a role model and inspiration. Pallical is the foremost policy expert on gender equity and caste justice in India. She once told me she feels joy when she hears about the impact of her work not just on big stages like the UN. She also deepens her bonds within the community by welcoming the occasional supporter — perhaps a new mother who may stop by her office, baby in tow — or by taking a Dalit protegee like me under her wing. She is a consummate example of how Dalit women lean on each other and the mutual care and support that we give each other and take from each other to keep moving forward. And she is a reminder to me of something else a Dalit woman can be — a world beater and achiever, not just a victim of our identity. While cruelties continue to be perpetrated on us as part of India’s age-old hierarchy, my community refuses to be defined by pain and oppression alone. Although gaining the constitutional right to equal education and employment has led to significant victories and more freedom than ever before in India’s caste-tainted history. Despite harsh realities faced by the people in my community, many have defied the odds and have overcome their struggles. I cannot help thinking, as India wraps up its general election, about the ways that we’ve gained via the political process, through anti-discrimination laws that have opened up new possibilities in work and education. But even these victories have come at a significant cost. The ignorant debates that continue to be spewed against affirmative action label us as undeserving. But these advances have led Dalit women to significant victories and more freedom than ever before in India’s caste-tainted history. After centuries of oppression and subjugation, such inroads will never be enough. Maybe there have been some promises that have been fulfilled by politicians seeking our votes. At least as often, there have been promises broken, a reminder that in the end, as we have always done, we need to fend for ourselves and lean on each other. Without the accomplishments of other Dalit women exemplars, I would not have dared believe that I could achieve what I have early in my career, getting into law school, becoming an activist, journalist, a perhaps a future diplomat. Maybe one day, a Dalit girl or woman will take heart from my example and find the strength to keep pushing forward in her goals too. Here’s what leaning into joy as a Dalit woman looks like: Sitting in my grandmother’s lap as a child, as she moved mountains with her storytelling. Seeing the only Dalit woman hockey player score a hat-trick at the Olympics, becoming the first Indian woman to do so. Joy is ranking number one in my exams toward the dream of becoming the first lawyer in my family. Joy is also going to the Buddha Vihara to give thanks the day my best friend gets a job. It is dancing in a sea of blue, with a crowd of women I have never met before, on Ambedkar Jayanti, the holiday celebrating the birthday of India’s revered Dalit constitutionalist leader. Joy is also singing Bhim Geet, the folk songs of praise for our leader on the way there. And there is joy in seeing the women of my community represent us on global stages and being inspired by their courage, because who I am today would never be a reality without the sisterhood I inherited from my community. Dalit women insist on moving past the societal conditioning that defines my community only by our suffering. We want to be seen as multifaceted individuals with a full palette of human experience and emotion, heard for our struggles, but also celebrated for our achievements. Watching the women of my community find their joy in this makes all the difference.",come india dalit community million people community suffers worst health outcome lack access clean water sanitation deprived educational occupational opportunity century dalits contemptuously dismissed untouchable term today understood slur community dalit woman doubly oppressed caste gender woman community vulnerable sexual violence india example say limited misfortune would misguided far reductive dalit woman experience unique daily life myriad way also embrace joy reality far complex encompasses much casteist gaze fetishizes pain reduces culture oppression dalit woman like bound together sense sisterhood woven long anyone remember long cruelty continue perpetrated u part india ageold hierarchy refuse defined pain oppression alone dont look dalit something many accomplished woman background heard least life clueless statement fueled casteinfluenced thinking dalit woman defined even look eternal state oppression often social medium news story focus violent atrocity community dalit woman achievement success joy achingly sidelined yes tragic story dalits story u deserve told story dalit woman becoming lawyer journalist policy analyst engineer athlete fashion model writer civil service officer musician story changed life young woman offering example way path process altering trajectory think mentor beena pallical made history becoming first dalit woman address un general assembly long role model inspiration pallical foremost policy expert gender equity caste justice india told feel joy hears impact work big stage like un also deepens bond within community welcoming occasional supporter perhaps new mother may stop office baby tow taking dalit protegee like wing consummate example dalit woman lean mutual care support give take keep moving forward reminder something else dalit woman world beater achiever victim identity cruelty continue perpetrated u part india ageold hierarchy community refuse defined pain oppression alone although gaining constitutional right equal education employment led significant victory freedom ever india castetainted history despite harsh reality faced people community many defied odds overcome struggle help thinking india wrap general election way weve gained via political process antidiscrimination law opened new possibility work education even victory come significant cost ignorant debate continue spewed affirmative action label u undeserving advance led dalit woman significant victory freedom ever india castetainted history century oppression subjugation inroad never enough maybe promise fulfilled politician seeking vote least often promise broken reminder end always done need fend lean without accomplishment dalit woman exemplar would dared believe could achieve early career getting law school becoming activist journalist perhaps future diplomat maybe one day dalit girl woman take heart example find strength keep pushing forward goal here leaning joy dalit woman look like sitting grandmother lap child moved mountain storytelling seeing dalit woman hockey player score hattrick olympics becoming first indian woman joy ranking number one exam toward dream becoming first lawyer family joy also going buddha vihara give thanks day best friend get job dancing sea blue crowd woman never met ambedkar jayanti holiday celebrating birthday india revered dalit constitutionalist leader joy also singing bhim geet folk song praise leader way joy seeing woman community represent u global stage inspired courage today would never reality without sisterhood inherited community dalit woman insist moving past societal conditioning defines community suffering want seen multifaceted individual full palette human experience emotion heard struggle also celebrated achievement watching woman community find joy make difference,26.0,positive,0
cnn,"2024 men’s T20 World Cup: Boasting over a billion fans across the world, cricket is set to enjoy ‘fiery vibes’ in New York","Jun 2, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/01/sport/2024-mens-t20-cricket-world-cup-opening-spt-intl/index.html,"Cricket is the second most popular sport around the globe – it has over one billion fans – but one market it has failed to crack is the US. That is despite cricket’s first ever international match having been played in Manhattan in 1844. And now, 180 years later, international cricket returns to the US with the men’s T20 World Cup. Here’s all you need to know about the ninth edition of the tournament which is being staged in the US and across the Caribbean. While cricket is certainly not one of the most popular sports in the US, it has slowly been making inroads over the last few years. Notably, Major League Cricket (MLC) – a professional T20 league held in the US – began last year, with international stars from across the globe helping kickstart a new era for the sport in the country. Three venues across the country – in Lauderhill, Florida, New York and Dallas – have been constructed to host T20 World Cup games. Dallas and Lauderhill will stage four matches apiece, while the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York – which has a capacity of 34,000 – will host eight games, including one of the matches of the tournament when India face Pakistan on June 9. The outfield at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium has been provided by the company who makes the turf at the home stadium of Inter Miami in Major League Soccer as well as both of New York’s Major League Baseball teams. It wasn’t an easy task to prepare the ground though, with pitches traveling in 20 semi-trailer trucks from Florida for 20 hours over 2,000 kilometers through six different states to reach the ground. The pitch’s square – the center of the field where bowlers and batters contest the game – has been overseen by the grounds people at the Adelaide Oval where Australia plays some of its international matches. “New York sports fans are the best. They just understand energy. They know how to bring the fiery vibes to their team, they’re maniacal about their teams,” Victor Cruz – Super Bowl-winning wide receiver for the New York Giants – said ahead of the tournament. “Well I think it’s just the overall intrigue (cricket in New York), right? They want to know what it’s about. They want to learn the rules. They want to see it in person. “So I think being able to see it with their own eyes in action would change their perspective.” The US team is led by 31-year-old wicket-keeper batter Monank Patel and includes former New Zealand international Corey Anderson. The 33-year-old Anderson, who represented the Black Caps in the 2015 men’s Cricket World Cup final, is eligible to play for the team as his wife is American and it has been over four years since he last played for New Zealand. Anderson once set the record for the fastest century in the history of one day international cricket, reaching 100 off just 36 balls in 2014. The US bowling attack is led by fast bowler Ali Khan who has recovered from a hamstring injury in time to feature for his country. Born in Pakistan, Khan moved to Ohio when he was a teenager and has featured in cricket leagues across the globe. “I am so excited,” the 33-year-old Khan told the Guardian on the eve of the tournament. “I believe we are capable of taking any side down. We have four games in our first round and we’re looking forward to every one of them.” While cricket in the US is very much in its nascent stage, the same cannot be said about the sport in the Caribbean. Cricket has long been established in the region, with some of its most famous players – Brian Lara, Viv Richards and Chris Gayle to name but a few – coming from the islands. However, the West Indies team has fallen on hard times lately, even if the Caribbean still remains a hotbed for fandom of cricket. Six venues across the Caribbean region will host 41 matches. The semifinals of the tournament will be hosted in Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana before the final which will be played in Barbados on June 29. Antigua & Barbuda, Saint Lucia and St. Vincent & the Grenadines will also host games. T20 cricket is one of the sport’s shortest formats, with both teams getting 20 overs apiece to bat as they seek the highest amount of runs. This version of cricket has become renowned for explosive action, big scores and dramatic finishes. The tournament will incorporate a record number of teams, with 20 nations gathering to battle for the crown of the best international cricket side in this short format of the game. Both North American teams will be making their first appearances in this edition, while Uganda are the other debutants. “I’ve been playing for 27 years for the national team, to see this dream is making me so, so happy,” Uganda’s 43-year-old spinner Frank Nsubuga told Reuters. “We want to leave a legacy … we want to leave something the world can see.” The teams are split into four groups of five, with the top two teams progressing to the next stage and the bottom three being eliminated. The remaining eight teams are split into two more groups, playing three further games against the sides in their group, with the top two countries in these new groups advancing to the semifinals. The 2024 men’s T20 World Cup begins on Saturday, June 1, with the two North American debutants – the US and Canada – opening proceedings against one another. The two team will raise the curtain on the tournament from Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium, Dallas, with the first ball being bowled at 7.30 p.m. local time/6.30 p.m. ET/1.30 a.m. UK time on Sunday June 2. The West Indies will begin its campaign in Guyana against Papua New Guinea on Sunday. Fans in the US and Canada can watch via WillowTV. The action will be shown on Sky Sports in the UK Star Sports Network and Disney + Hotstar in India.

cnn,India’s scorching heat and lack of water leave Delhi’s poor to suffer worst of climate crisis,"Jun 1, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/01/india/india-scorching-heat-climate-crisis-intl-hnk/index.html,"There’s no fresh water in the slums of Delhi’s Chanakyapuri neighborhood. It’s 49.9 degrees Celsius, or 121 Fahrenheit – the hottest temperature on record. The sun belts off the tin roofs of the shanties. Desperate people wait for drinking water to be delivered. When it arrives, there’s chaos. Dozens of people run to the truck, some even climbing on top of it to throw pipes in, pushing in to get their containers filled with water. It’s first come first served, and many people miss out. Mother-of-six Poonam Shah is one of those people. “There are 10 people in my family – six kids, me and my husband, my in-laws, relatives come over sometimes – can we all bathe in one bucket of water?” she asks. Today her family may not even have one bucket. Poonam was working her street food stall when the water truck arrived. She tried to run back for it – but it was too late, the water had run out. “What are we supposed to do? There’s no water. I work in a shop, there’s no water there. But forget about the shop, we don’t have water for our kids.” She’ll now look to buy water – it’ll cost up to half of the $3 she usually earns in a day selling samosas and other snacks. As record heat grips northern India, the Delhi government has been forced to ration these free water deliveries. Previously, Poonam’s neighborhood received two to three tanker deliveries per day. Now it’s just the one. Temperatures in Delhi have been hovering above 40 degrees Celsius over the last week and on Tuesday they hit an all-time high of 49.9 degrees Celsius in one area of the capital, according to the Indian Meteorological Department. At least one death has been reported in the city so far, and dozens more across the country. At Ram Manohar Lohiya (RML) hospital in Delhi, a heatstroke unit with cold immersion tanks is treating more and more patients suffering extreme heatstroke, exhaustion and dehydration. The hospital’s ice baths and air conditioning can help a handful of the millions of people who have no choice but to brave the Delhi heat to earn a living, but only if they get to hospital quickly. “The mortality rate of heatstroke is very, very high, it is close to 60% to 80%,” Dr Ajay Shukla, medical superintendent of the hospital, told CNN. “People can survive if they get immediate and very early medical care and that involves rapidly cooling the body.” “If people get that rapid cooling, they stabilize, they survive. But if they get to the hospital late and the intervention is late, the mortality rate is so high. We’re unable to save them if they come to us late.” The patient who died in Delhi had been admitted to RML hospital. He was a 40-year-old migrant laborer, and like many working outdoors in the harsh sun, he succumbed to the heat. “He was working in a factory… he was working in an area where there was no cooling, a very small congested area with a tin shed so there were multiple workers inside,” Dr Shukla said, adding that it was too late by the time he arrived at the hospital. The man’s name has not been released, for privacy reasons. Most of the hospital’s heatstroke patients are from poorer communities, where working people have no choice but to spend long stretches out in the summer sun. Kali Prasad sells water and lemon juice outside the India Gate. Each day he pushes his water cart to the famed spot, from his home some eight kilometers (five miles) away. “The heat has risen drastically over the last five to 10 days, it’s very hot, people aren’t even coming here because of it,” he said. He says he has no choice but to stand all day under the scorching sun, as there is no one else to provide for his wife, children and parents. In recent years, the summer heat has come earlier, temperatures have risen higher and higher, and heatwaves have lengthened. Northwest and central India have been experiencing maximum temperatures above 42 degrees Celsius with some towns even crossing the 50-degree mark, according to the Indian Meteorological Department. The trend is “a clear manifestation of the escalating impacts of climate change,” says Farwa Aamer, the director of South Asia initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “This alarming spike in temperatures underscores the urgent need for robust adaptation strategies and proactive measures in India and the region to protect lives and livelihoods, especially among vulnerable populations, from the devastating health effects of such intense heat,” said Aamer, who researches climate vulnerabilities in South Asia. For many in Delhi, the climate crisis has already made life during summer unbearable. “We have to deal so we deal, we are poor people so we have to die, we have to work no matter how hot it is,” Kali Prasad said. “We don’t have any other option.”",there fresh water slum delhi chanakyapuri neighborhood degree celsius fahrenheit hottest temperature record sun belt tin roof shanty desperate people wait drinking water delivered arrives there chaos dozen people run truck even climbing top throw pipe pushing get container filled water first come first served many people miss motherofsix poonam shah one people people family six kid husband inlaws relative come sometimes bathe one bucket water asks today family may even one bucket poonam working street food stall water truck arrived tried run back late water run supposed there water work shop there water forget shop dont water kid shell look buy water itll cost half usually earns day selling samosa snack record heat grip northern india delhi government forced ration free water delivery previously poonams neighborhood received two three tanker delivery per day one temperature delhi hovering degree celsius last week tuesday hit alltime high degree celsius one area capital according indian meteorological department least one death reported city far dozen across country ram manohar lohiya rml hospital delhi heatstroke unit cold immersion tank treating patient suffering extreme heatstroke exhaustion dehydration hospital ice bath air conditioning help handful million people choice brave delhi heat earn living get hospital quickly mortality rate heatstroke high close dr ajay shukla medical superintendent hospital told cnn people survive get immediate early medical care involves rapidly cooling body people get rapid cooling stabilize survive get hospital late intervention late mortality rate high unable save come u late patient died delhi admitted rml hospital yearold migrant laborer like many working outdoors harsh sun succumbed heat working factory working area cooling small congested area tin shed multiple worker inside dr shukla said adding late time arrived hospital man name released privacy reason hospital heatstroke patient poorer community working people choice spend long stretch summer sun kali prasad sell water lemon juice outside india gate day push water cart famed spot home eight kilometer five mile away heat risen drastically last five day hot people arent even coming said say choice stand day scorching sun one else provide wife child parent recent year summer heat come earlier temperature risen higher higher heatwaves lengthened northwest central india experiencing maximum temperature degree celsius town even crossing degree mark according indian meteorological department trend clear manifestation escalating impact climate change say farwa aamer director south asia initiative asia society policy institute alarming spike temperature underscore urgent need robust adaptation strategy proactive measure india region protect life livelihood especially among vulnerable population devastating health effect intense heat said aamer research climate vulnerability south asia many delhi climate crisis already made life summer unbearable deal deal poor people die work matter hot kali prasad said dont option,-20.0,negative,2
cnn,India records bumper economic growth as election draws to a close,"May 31, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/business/india-gdp-q4-growth-intl-hnk/index.html,"India’s economy grew by more than 8% in the fiscal year that ended in March, according to data published Friday that gives a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi just hours before the country concludes its mammoth, weeks-long national election. Gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 8.2%, according to the Statistics Ministry, cementing India’s status as the world’s fastest growing major economy. The rate of growth was higher than the Modi government’s forecast of 7.6%. For the final quarter of the fiscal year, GDP expanded at a faster-than-expected rate of 7.8%, compared with the same period in 2023. GDP had risen by 8.6% in the October-December period. “We expect economic activity to moderate a bit further over the coming quarters, but India will remain a global outperformer,” said Ankita Amajuri, assistant economist at Capital Economics. There’s less than 24 hours to go before polls close in the election. Modi is running on his economic record over the past 10 years, a period of robust growth for India. The country went from the ninth largest economy in the world to the fifth largest during that time. It also experienced the largest percentage growth in GDP over the decade compared to other major economies. Results will be declared on June 4. If Modi wins a third term, “any deceleration (in the economy) will be mild,” added Amajuri. Sustained expansion will push India higher up the ranks of the world’s biggest economies, with some observers forecasting the country to become number three behind only the US and China by 2027. India is widely seen as an alternative to China for countries and companies looking to diversify their supply chains, particularly as the relationship between Washington and Beijing sours. Some of the world’s biggest companies, including Apple (AAPL) supplier Foxconn, are already expanding their operations there. “After China, India is the only economy that can achieve economies of scale, due to its large market,” wrote Nomura economists in a report earlier this week. “India is one of the few economies that is garnering investor interest across a variety of sectors,” they added. Despite the euphoria surrounding the growth figures, economists say there are enormous challenges facing the Indian economy in the next decade. The new government will have to create hundreds of millions of jobs for a population that remains largely impoverished. With an average age of 29 years, India’s population is one of the youngest globally, but the country is not yet able to reap the potential economic benefits from its youthful demographics. According to a recent report by the International Labour Organization, educated Indians between the ages of 15 and 29 are more likely to be unemployed than those without any schooling, which reflects “a mismatch with their aspirations and available jobs.” Youth unemployment rates in India are now higher than global levels, it said. Analysts fear that if Modi’s party underperforms in the polls, it may put key land and labor reforms on the backburner. But one of the biggest long-term threats facing the Indian economy is climate change. The country is particularly vulnerable to extreme heat and some places there are pushing the limits of human survivability, experts say. Earlier this week, India’s capital territory of Delhi recorded its highest-ever temperature of 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 degrees Fahrenheit), and the oppressive heat wave forced authorities to impose water rationing. Rising mercury levels in India risks reversing progress on poverty alleviation, health and economic growth, experts say. The country is “expected to lose about 5.8% of daily working hours due to heat stress in 2030,” said a United Nations’ Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) report in April. “The problem is most severe for outdoor workers, particularly those employed in agriculture and construction, but also relevant for indoor factory workers,” it added.",india economy grew fiscal year ended march according data published friday give boost prime minister narendra modi hour country concludes mammoth weekslong national election gross domestic product gdp increased according statistic ministry cementing india status world fastest growing major economy rate growth higher modi government forecast final quarter fiscal year gdp expanded fasterthanexpected rate compared period gdp risen octoberdecember period expect economic activity moderate bit coming quarter india remain global outperformer said ankita amajuri assistant economist capital economics there le hour go poll close election modi running economic record past year period robust growth india country went ninth largest economy world fifth largest time also experienced largest percentage growth gdp decade compared major economy result declared june modi win third term deceleration economy mild added amajuri sustained expansion push india higher rank world biggest economy observer forecasting country become number three behind u china india widely seen alternative china country company looking diversify supply chain particularly relationship washington beijing sour world biggest company including apple aapl supplier foxconn already expanding operation china india economy achieve economy scale due large market wrote nomura economist report earlier week india one economy garnering investor interest across variety sector added despite euphoria surrounding growth figure economist say enormous challenge facing indian economy next decade new government create hundred million job population remains largely impoverished average age year india population one youngest globally country yet able reap potential economic benefit youthful demographic according recent report international labour organization educated indian age likely unemployed without schooling reflects mismatch aspiration available job youth unemployment rate india higher global level said analyst fear modis party underperforms poll may put key land labor reform backburner one biggest longterm threat facing indian economy climate change country particularly vulnerable extreme heat place pushing limit human survivability expert say earlier week india capital territory delhi recorded highestever temperature degree celsius degree fahrenheit oppressive heat wave forced authority impose water rationing rising mercury level india risk reversing progress poverty alleviation health economic growth expert say country expected lose daily working hour due heat stress said united nation economic social commission asia pacific escap report april problem severe outdoor worker particularly employed agriculture construction also relevant indoor factory worker added,5.0,neutral,0
cnn,Indian airline gives female travelers option to choose seats next to other women,"May 31, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/travel/indigo-indian-airline-female-travelers-seating-intl-hnk/index.html,"One of India’s biggest airlines has just launched a new feature that allows female travelers to see where other women are sitting when selecting seats for their flights. According to a statement sent to CNN, low-cost carrier IndiGo Airlines is offering the feature on a pilot basis to female passengers checking in for their flights online. The carrier, founded in 2006, operates more than 2,000 domestic and international flights per day in India. In the statement, IndiGo said the feature, which will be available to women traveling solo or as part of a family booking, aligns with their “#GirlPower ethos.” “IndiGo is proud to announce the introduction of a new feature that aims to make the travel experience more comfortable for our female passengers,” said the airline. “We are committed to providing an unparalleled travel experience for all our passengers, and this new feature is just one of the many steps we are taking towards achieving that goal.” CNN has reached out to IndiGo for more information on the rollout of the new feature. Though the airline didn’t specify a reason for giving women the option of seeing where other females are seated, assaults against women and children during commercial flights are reported regularly all over the world. In the US, crimes aboard aircraft fall within the FBI’s jurisdiction. In a report released in April aimed at raising awareness of sexual assaults on planes, it said it opened 96 in-flight sexual assault cases in 2023. “Sexual assault aboard aircraft – which usually takes the form of unwanted touching – is a felony that can land offenders in prison,” said the report. “Typically, men are the perpetrators, and women and unaccompanied minors are the victims.”",one india biggest airline launched new feature allows female traveler see woman sitting selecting seat flight according statement sent cnn lowcost carrier indigo airline offering feature pilot basis female passenger checking flight online carrier founded operates domestic international flight per day india statement indigo said feature available woman traveling solo part family booking aligns girlpower ethos indigo proud announce introduction new feature aim make travel experience comfortable female passenger said airline committed providing unparalleled travel experience passenger new feature one many step taking towards achieving goal cnn reached indigo information rollout new feature though airline didnt specify reason giving woman option seeing female seated assault woman child commercial flight reported regularly world u crime aboard aircraft fall within fbi jurisdiction report released april aimed raising awareness sexual assault plane said opened inflight sexual assault case sexual assault aboard aircraft usually take form unwanted touching felony land offender prison said report typically men perpetrator woman unaccompanied minor victim,-16.0,negative,2

Modi will visit the Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari, a pilgrimage site off India’s southernmost tip, from May 30 to June 1, according to Indian state broadcaster DD News. The site is where popular Hindu monk and philosopher Swami Vivekananda attained enlightenment. Modi has twice before ended an election campaign with meditation. But he has recently been making increasingly grand displays of piety, to capitalize on Hindu-nationalist sentiment as he eyes a third consecutive five-year term in power. In an interview last week with local news channel NDTV, Modi said: “I’m convinced that God has sent me for a purpose, and when that purpose is finished, my work will be done.” “God doesn’t reveal his cards. He just keeps making me do things,” he continued. India is constitutionally bound to secularism, but since assuming power in 2014 Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have promoted a strident brand of Hindu nationalism that has deepened religious divides. When he first contested national elections a decade ago, Modi chose India’s spiritual capital Varanasi as his constituency, making the ancient city the perfect backdrop to meld his religious and political ambitions. At the end of that campaign, Modi visited Pratapgad in the western state of Maharashtra, where the Hindu-led Maratha forces won a historic battle against the Mughal empire army in the 17th century. Toward the end of the 2019 national elections, which he also won, Modi went to meditate in the revered Kedarnath shrine dedicated to Hindu deity Lord Shiva high in the Himalayas. In January, just months before campaigning began, Modi consecrated the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, a controversial Hindu temple that was built on the site of a destroyed mosque, taking on a role typically reserved for priests. In a country where about 80% of the population are followers of the polytheistic faith, critics say Modi’s brandishing of Hinduism has led to rising Islamophobia and persecution of the country’s more than 200 million Muslims. Modi and the BJP have increasingly resorted to overtly Islamophobic language during his recent election speeches. In a controversial speech last month, Modi said that if the opposition wins, they would distribute the country’s wealth among “infiltrators” and “those who have more children,” in apparent reference to the Muslim community.",india prime minister narendra modi way meditate inside island shrine two day cap week election campaigning latest public display religiosity day proclaiming sent god india election world largest mammoth exercise democracy taken place six week final day voting take place saturday result announced three day later modi visit vivekananda rock memorial kanyakumari pilgrimage site india southernmost tip may june according indian state broadcaster dd news site popular hindu monk philosopher swami vivekananda attained enlightenment modi twice ended election campaign meditation recently making increasingly grand display piety capitalize hindunationalist sentiment eye third consecutive fiveyear term power interview last week local news channel ndtv modi said im convinced god sent purpose purpose finished work done god doesnt reveal card keep making thing continued india constitutionally bound secularism since assuming power modi bharatiya janata party bjp promoted strident brand hindu nationalism deepened religious divide first contested national election decade ago modi chose india spiritual capital varanasi constituency making ancient city perfect backdrop meld religious political ambition end campaign modi visited pratapgad western state maharashtra hinduled maratha force historic battle mughal empire army th century toward end national election also modi went meditate revered kedarnath shrine dedicated hindu deity lord shiva high himalaya january month campaigning began modi consecrated ram mandir ayodhya controversial hindu temple built site destroyed mosque taking role typically reserved priest country population follower polytheistic faith critic say modis brandishing hinduism led rising islamophobia persecution country million muslim modi bjp increasingly resorted overtly islamophobic language recent election speech controversial speech last month modi said opposition win would distribute country wealth among infiltrator child apparent reference muslim community,16.0,positive,2
cnn,"Indian capital of Delhi breaks all-time heat record, as authorities impose water rationing","May 29, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/29/weather/india-heat-record-water-rationing-intl/index.html,"India’s capital territory of Delhi sweltered to its highest-ever temperature of 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 degrees Fahrenheit) on Tuesday, as an oppressive heat wave forced authorities to impose water rationing. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said the new record was measured in the suburb of Mungeshpur, surpassing Delhi’s previous high of 49.2 degrees Celsius (120.5 degrees Fahrenheit), observed in May 2022. Some areas of Delhi are struggling to access water, while others have none at all, said Atishi Marlena Singh, a senior minister in the Delhi government, at a news conference. Areas that normally receive water supplies twice a day will now have their delivery cut to once a day to redirect resources to areas that have had little to no supply at all, Singh said. The water shortages were caused by the “acute heatwave,” as well as a lack of water deliveries from the northern state of Haryana to Delhi, which are not being made as usual, Singh said. Delhi was not alone, as the mercury spiked across northwestern India. The temperature in the city of Churu in the state of Rajasthan soared to 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit). Sirsa, a city in the state of Haryana, saw thermometers reach 50.3 degrees Celsius (122.5 degrees Fahrenheit), Indian authorities said. Heatwave conditions will prevail in Delhi on Wednesday but are expected to subside starting Thursday, the IMD said. Extreme heat is becoming more common and intense in much of the world because of the human-caused climate crisis. India is particularly vulnerable to extreme heat and some places there are pushing the limits of human survivability, experts say. One study found that heat waves have killed more than 24,000 people in the country since 1992. The increase in heat events in coming years could threaten India’s development, and risk reversing its progress on poverty alleviation, health and economic growth, the study said.",india capital territory delhi sweltered highestever temperature degree celsius degree fahrenheit tuesday oppressive heat wave forced authority impose water rationing indian meteorological department imd said new record measured suburb mungeshpur surpassing delhi previous high degree celsius degree fahrenheit observed may area delhi struggling access water others none said atishi marlena singh senior minister delhi government news conference area normally receive water supply twice day delivery cut day redirect resource area little supply singh said water shortage caused acute heatwave well lack water delivery northern state haryana delhi made usual singh said delhi alone mercury spiked across northwestern india temperature city churu state rajasthan soared degree celsius degree fahrenheit sirsa city state haryana saw thermometer reach degree celsius degree fahrenheit indian authority said heatwave condition prevail delhi wednesday expected subside starting thursday imd said extreme heat becoming common intense much world humancaused climate crisis india particularly vulnerable extreme heat place pushing limit human survivability expert say one study found heat wave killed people country since increase heat event coming year could threaten india development risk reversing progress poverty alleviation health economic growth study said,-17.0,negative,2
cnn,More than 50 killed by Cyclone Remal in India and Bangladesh,"May 29, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/26/india/cyclone-remal-india-bangladesh-landfall-intl-hnk/index.html,"More than 50 people have died in India and Bangladesh after Tropical Cyclone Remal lashed the area with torrential rain and heavy winds, according to local officials. Remal made landfall at the start of the week and while it weakened it has brought torrential rain to much of Bangladesh and northeastern India. The death toll across both nations has now risen to 51 people. The northeastern Indian state of Mizoram has been hit hardest with landslides killing 27 people, according to local officials. “Electricity and water supply will be stifled due to damage of infrastructure,” the Mizoram government said in a statement on X. Cyclone-related deaths were also reported in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal and the southern Indian state of Telangana as well as Bangladesh. The Indian Meteorological Department on Tuesday said Remal weakened into a depression over east Bangladesh after losing some force earlier on Monday. It caused widespread damage in both countries, toppling trees, turning roads into rivers and leaving millions without electricity. More than 1 million people in India and Bangladesh were evacuated Sunday as the cyclone made landfall near the border between the two countries. Authorities said that volunteers and army staff were mobilized to assist with clean-up efforts, and distribute food and water to displaced families. Remal made landfall roughly 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of the Indian city of Kolkata, packing gusts of up to 135 kilometers per hour (84 miles per hour), and is moving northwards across Bangladesh and its adjoining West Bengal coasts, the Indian Meteorological Department said. The storm weakened after it hit the coast with wind speeds of up to 115 kilometers per hour (71 mph). Remal is expected to dump more than 89 millimeters (3.5 inches) of rain and bring wind-driven storm surges of 2.5 to 3.7 meters to the coasts of the Bay of Bengal, according to CNN Weather. The ports of Mongla and Payra in Bangladesh put up the Great Danger Signal 10 — the highest alert signal — on Sunday, and all boats were advised to remain in shelter by the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. About 2 million people live in storm-affected areas in Bangladesh, according to non-profit BRAC. At least half a million of these people “live in houses made of materials such as clay, wood, plastic sheets, straw or tin,” said Dr. Md Liakath Ali, a disaster expert at BRAC. The country is one of the world’s most vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis, studies show. Millions are without power as authorities shut down electricity supply to many areas in advance to avoid accidents, according to Ali. Fallen trees and broken lines disrupted supply, he said. An especially vulnerable group are the stateless Rohingya communities who fled persecution in nearby Myanmar during a military crackdown in 2017. They are already living in the world’s largest refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, which is at risk of landslides and floods, owing to the flimsy structure of their shelters. Many live in bamboo and tarpaulin shelters perched on hilly slopes that are vulnerable to strong winds, rain, and landslides. Video taken by a BRAC volunteer early Monday in Mongla showed a woman struggling to walk through the floodwaters as gusts of wind nearly toppled her over. In India, video from the country’s National Disaster Response Force showed workers removing broken trees in the state of West Bengal as heavy rain lashed down on them. The Coast Guard was closely monitoring Remal’s landfall, with ships and hovercraft on standby to respond to any challenges, it said. Hundreds of flights were also impacted following the closure on Sunday of the main international airport in Kolkata, West Bengal state’s capital. Air traffic in and out of the airport resumed on Monday, but disruptions continued with dozens of flights delayed, according to the airport’s official website. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said he had reviewed disaster management and preparation efforts. “I pray for everyone’s safety and wellbeing,” Modi wrote on X. Cyclones, also known as typhoons and called hurricanes in North America, are enormous heat engines of wind and rain that feed on warm ocean water and moist air. And scientists say the climate crisis is making them more potent. A study published in 2021 by researchers at the Shenzhen Institute of Meteorological Innovation and the Chinese University of Hong Kong and published in Frontiers in Earth Science found that tropical cyclones in Asia could have double the destructive power by the end of the century, with scientists saying the human-made climate crisis is already making them stronger. The cyclone comes as parts of western and central India continue to bake under severe heat, with temperatures soaring beyond 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some cities, causing illness and forcing some schools to close. Climate scientists have long warned that these extremes of weather will only continue to intensify because of the climate crisis, with millions of people in India vulnerable to the risks associated with it.

cnn,"May 28, 2024 - Israel-Hamas war","May 29, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-05-28-24/index.html,"Our live coverage of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza has moved here. Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley wrote “Finish Them!” on Israeli artillery shells during a Memorial Day visit to Israel, according to photos in a post from Danny Danon, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, who accompanied her on the trip. Her visit to the northern Israeli border came a day after an Israeli strike that killed 45 at a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the strike as “a tragic error”. Haley’s message echoes her previous sentiment during a Fox News interview in which she condemned Hamas’ attacks and called on Netanyahu to “finish them.” CNN has reached out to representatives for Haley for comment. She also reaffirmed her commitment to Israel, saying during the tour, saying “Don’t listen to what is being said in the media. I reassure you: America stands with Israel!” During the Memorial Day weekend trip, Haley visited Kibbutz Nir Oz, the site of the Nova festival, and Sderot. She reflected in a social media post about a nurse she met whose “life changed forever’ after October 7. “When she escaped, she tried to treat victims who were butchered and left to slowly die. Now, she bravely tells her story to bear witness for the hundreds who can’t — raped, tortured, kidnapped, and murdered simply for being Israeli,” she continued. Algeria has circulated to all UN Security Council members a proposed draft resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the unconditional release of all hostages, a UN diplomat told CNN on Tuesday. It’s unknown how the US will vote on this. Algeria’s draft resolution comes after 45 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Rafah camp housing displaced people on Sunday. A Greek owned and operated merchant ship in the Red Sea reported being struck by three anti-ship ballistic missiles launched Tuesday by Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, according to US Central Command. Merchant Vessel Laax continued on its voyage and there were no injuries reported, CENTCOM said in a statement. During the same time, US forces destroyed five Houthi drones over the Red Sea that were launched from a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen and “presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels in the region,” the statement added. At least 940,000 people have been displaced from Rafah in the past three weeks as a result of “the intensification of hostilities and issuance of evacuation orders” by Israeli forces, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). Many of the displaced Palestinians are attempting to evacuate following devastating Israeli strikes – but they don’t know where to go. Here are more headlines you should know: More on the Rafah strike: International reaction to the Rafah strike: Other Israeli attacks: Broken pier: US-made munitions were used in a deadly Israeli strike on a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah, a CNN analysis of video from the scene and a review by explosive weapons experts found. CNN geolocated videos showing tents in flames in the aftermath of the strike on the camp for internally displaced people (IDPs) known as “Kuwait Peace Camp 1.” In video shared on social media, which CNN geolocated to the same scene by matching details including the camp’s entrance sign and the tiles on the ground, the tail of a US-made GBU-39 small-diameter bomb (SDB) is visible, according to four explosive weapons experts who reviewed the video for CNN. The GBU-39, manufactured by Boeing, is a high-precision munition “designed to attack strategically important point targets,” and result in low collateral damage, explosive weapons expert Chris Cobb-Smith told CNN. However, “using any munition, even of this size, will always incur risks in a densely populated area,” said Cobb-Smith, a former British Army artillery officer. Trevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member who also identified the fragment as being from a GBU-39, explained to CNN how he drew his conclusion. CNN’s identification of the munition is consistent with a claim made by Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari in a briefing about the tragedy on Tuesday. Hagari said the strike – which he said targeted senior Hamas commanders – used two munitions with small warheads containing 17 kilos of explosives, adding these bombs were “the smallest munitions that our jets could use.” The traditional GBU-39 warhead has an explosive payload of 17 kilos. Additionally, serial numbers on the remnants match those for a manufacturer of GBU-39 parts based in California – more evidence the bombs were made in the US. The Pentagon declined to comment and referred CNN to comments from Israel on its operation. CNN has also reached out to the US National Security Council. Read the full story. French UN Ambassador Nicolas de Rivière warned of any further escalations in Rafah, saying “it is high time,” for the UN Security Council (UNSC) “to take action and to adopt a new resolution” about the war in Gaza. He added that the Security Council “must fulfill its mandate and take action now,” “It must allow the UN to play its full role in the Gaza Strip, in order to cover the immediate needs of the population,” he said. “France will remain committed to building a state for the Palestinians and security guarantees for Israel,” Rivière added. The situation in Rafah is “very miserable,” according to a doctor currently working in the southern Gaza city. “All night, we couldn’t sleep,” Dr. Safa Jaber told Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF (Médecins Sans Frontières), in an Arabic audio message shared by the group on X with English subtitles. Displaced Palestinians are attempting to evacuate following devastating Israeli strikes in southern Gaza – but they don’t know where to go. Speaking to a CNN stringer in Khan Younis, north of Rafah, people said they did not know where else to go, as they tried to head north toward Deir El-Balah in central Gaza. Video from the stringer shows mattresses, wooden panels, chairs, and various other belongings piled on top of vehicles and donkey carts. The roads, lined by tents and piles of garbage, were busy with people and vehicles moving in search of empty spaces. Walking on crutches, Mohamed Jarbou, said, “The elderly have been humiliated. Children humiliated. What’s wrong? They are all civilians. The resistance is not here. The resistance is fighting somewhere else. We are displaced. Why are you hitting the displaced people?” Israeli strikes over the past two days in Rafah have forced the already displaced people to flee. More than two dozen people were killed in Israel strikes on two camps on Tuesday, according to Palestinian officials. The Israeli military denied striking a humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi, telling CNN, “Contrary to the reports from the last few hours, the IDF did not strike in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.” CNN has asked if the military struck elsewhere in Al-Mawasi, and for comment on a strike that hit the Tal al-Sultan camp. The Israeli military is looking into the possibility that Sunday’s strike on Rafah may have unintentionally set off possible stored weapons in a nearby compound and a large fire that decimated part of a camp housing displaced Palestinians, according to spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari. Hagari described it as one of several possibilities and did not provide any verifiable evidence to bolster the claim. He also said Israel is assessing social media footage from the night of the strike that appears to show secondary explosions. Hagari then played the audio of an allegedly intercepted call, described by the Israel Defense Forces as “between two Gazans about the strike in Rafah.” An unidentified speaker says an ammunition warehouse exploded, causing secondary explosions. The unknown speaker also said the Israeli strike was “small” and did not create a large crater. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the audio, when it was recorded, or what information the speakers in the audio had. Hagari said the incident was being investigated by the General Staff’s Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism who he said would conduct a transparent investigation. CNN posed a follow-up question to Hagari, about whether Israel could confirm that none of the civilians killed were killed in the initial Israeli strike, only in the ensuing secondary explosions or the fire. Hagari could not confirm that, repeating that the investigation was ongoing. Protesters in cities across Europe gathered to voice opposition to the deadly strike carried out Sunday by Israel on a camp housing displaced people in Rafah in southern Gaza. In Paris, a huge crowd congregated in Place de la République, a famous spot for protests. The demonstrators then marched to the nearby Canal Saint Martin, according to a CNN producer in Paris. Large crowds also gathered outside the home of UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on London’s Downing Street. In social media videos, they could be heard chanting slogans, “Blood on your hands” and “Stop arming Israel” in the direction of Downing Street. Sunak has faced intense pressure in recent months from campaigners and opposition lawmakers to stop selling arms to Israel. In Italy,  at least 1,000 protesters occupied Bologna’s main train station, according to the authority of the train station. The protesters marched from the university district to the station and caused delays across the region, according to Italy’s national railway company. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Tuesday that Sunday’s airstrike that killed dozens of people at a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah, Gaza, did not cross President Joe Biden’s red line. Kirby added that he had “no policy changes to speak to” when asked if this strike would change policy – but emphasized that this strike “just happened.” At least 45 people were killed and more than 200 others injured after a fire broke out at the camp following the strike on Sunday, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and Palestinian medics. When asked whether the president has seen some of the images from Rafah over the weekend, Kirby said he could not speak on that but that the president has been “kept apprised throughout the weekend.” Footage obtained by CNN showed the camp in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. Pressed on whether Israel tanks seen in central Rafah constitute a major ground operation, Kirby pointed to comments from the Israelis saying that they are operating in Rafah in a “targeted” and “precise” way. “That’s what the Israelis have said, we’re not on the ground,” Kirby told reporters. At least 940,000 people have been displaced from Rafah in the past three weeks as a result of “the intensification of hostilities and issuance of evacuation orders” by Israeli forces, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). “Attacks on Rafah have continued unabated, and civilians displaced by hostilities lack shelter, they lack food, they lack water and other supplies essential to their human survival,” UNOCHA said in a statement Tuesday read by Deputy UN spokesman Farhan Haq. “While the Kerem Shalom crossing remains open in principle, it is extremely difficult for aid organizations to access from the Gaza side due to the hostilities, challenging logistical conditions, and complex coordination procedures,” UNOCHA said, citing aid workers in Gaza. At least 29 Palestinians have been killed in two separate Israeli attacks in Rafah on Tuesday, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health and the Emergency Committee of the Rafah Governorate. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN on Tuesday that its forces are “operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities.” “In stark contrast to Hamas’ intentional attacks on Israeli men, women and children, the IDF follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm,” the IDF added. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said his staff are “terrified” and are packing up and moving following strikes in Tal al-Sultan in the early hours of Tuesday. Lazzarini said the main offices of the UN in Gaza are in the Tal al-Sultan area and that most of the staff could not make it to work. “UNRWA running out of medical supplies and basic medicines. Little to no electricity with very patchy internet as the telecommunications network continues to be interrupted. People search for safety to no avail,” he said. Some context: Officials in Gaza and residents said an Israeli attack happened at around 3 a.m. on Tuesday (local time) in Tal al-Sultan camp in western Rafah, hitting three tents and killing at least eight people. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment. Residents of the Tal al-Sultan displacement camp in western Rafah have recounted to CNN the horrifying scenes that followed an Israeli strike Tuesday, which according to Palestinian and UN officials killed eight people. Video of the aftermath from a CNN stringer shows torn up tents, burnt sheets of metal and a clutter of furniture and clothing thrown on the ground. Walls are pierced with holes and the wooden structures holding up the tents are completely damaged. CNN has reached out to the IDF regarding the strike, but has not received a response. One resident, Hind Al-Ashqar, told CNN she was asleep with her family when she awoke to the sound of her neighbors screaming. “Our children were terrified; I have a 5-year-old that was so horrified. We were all scared, children and adults,” she said. Al-Ashqar’s daughter Ayat said she ran out of their tent to check on their neighbors, some of whom were her relatives, only to find them dead on the ground. “I was so terrified to see the remains of people. We have been displaced and living in nylon tents. We see remains and body parts of martyrs, we see the strikes and shrapnel hitting us. If we were in our homes, we wouldn’t be afraid of shrapnel. But inside tents, any shrapnel can hit us and even burn us,” Ayat continued. Another resident, Imad, pulled out the remains of a person while rummaging through the torn-up tents, saying “this is the safe place they talk about.” Another resident, Mohammed, told CNN people were asleep when they were killed, including his cousin. He said he has been picking up dead bodies of children and body parts since the morning, pointing to his blood-stained shirt. “Instead of waking up and saying thank God, we woke up and picked up body parts…. every day there is a war. Enough is enough…the whole world is living freely and happily except us. Why? How is the whole world unable to stop Israel and Netanyahu?” he said. A displaced woman Suhad told a CNN stringer she had been sheltering in a nearby camp when she heard there had been a strike on her brother’s camp. “I didn’t sleep all night. I was told he was martyred, then he wasn’t. He was martyred, then he wasn’t. She said her brother’s four daughters, the youngest three months old, survived but were injured. CNN stringer video from the scene shows dozens of people dismantling the remains of their makeshift tents, gathering what’s left of their belongings and loading them onto trucks and donkey carts. They told a CNN stringer on the ground that they are forced to flee again, some for the sixth time, out of fear of being killed. “We were in the North, they struck our home, and my dad was martyred. They said go east of the valley, we went to Nuseirat. They hit Nuseirat, we fled to Khan Younis. They entered Khan Younis, we fled to Rafah. After they entered Rafah, we wanted to go back to Khan Younis. God knows where we shall go next. There is no safe place in Gaza,” Mohammed said. Another man, wearing a gray baseball cap, said, “For God’s sake, look at us, show us some respect. We want nothing from you. We want to live like in all other countries. We want freedom. We want stability… We are not beggars waiting for aid. The people of Palestine are not a field for experimentation. Enough, enough.” The temporary pier constructed by the US military to transport aid into Gaza broke apart in heavy seas on Tuesday in a major blow to the American-led effort to create a maritime corridor for humanitarian supplies into the war-torn enclave, according to four US officials, Part of the pier, which consists of a narrow causeway to drive aid into Gaza and a wider parking area to drop off supplies transported by ship, disconnected on Tuesday, the officials said. The parking area will have to be reconnected to the causeway before the pier can be used again. The setback came one day after heavy seas forced two small US Army vessels to beach in Israel, according to US Central Command, while another two vessels broke free of their moorings and were anchored near the pier. The effort to reassemble the causeway and connect it once again to the parking area will resume when sea conditions allow, officials said. The temporary pier, called the Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS), requires very good sea conditions to operate. CNN reported previously that JLOTS can only be operated safely in a maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour. Heavier sea conditions delayed the deployment of the pier for several weeks, as the system sat docked in the Israeli port of Ashdod waiting for favorable conditions. The US has stressed that the temporary pier is only meant to augment humanitarian shipments going through the land crossings between Israel and Gaza. On Thursday, Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, deputy commander of US Central Command, said 820 metric tonnes of aid had been delivered through the pier to the Gaza beach, where the United Nations was responsible for distributing it to the Palestinian population Daniel Dieckhaus, the director of USAID’s levant response management team, told reporters Thursday that there were “thousands and thousands of tonnes” of aid waiting in Cyprus to be delivered through the maritime corridor. But those shipments are now paused with the temporary pier inoperable. The United States “will be watching” the results of the Israeli investigation into the deadly strike and subsequent fire in Rafah “closely,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Tuesday, saying that the findings should be “presented openly and transparently to us and to the world.” Miller said the US will withhold its assessments until it sees the final findings of Israel’s investigation. “As soon as the United States saw reports of this incident, we reached out to the government of Israel to express our deep concern over what happened, ask for more information and urge them to undertake a full investigation,” he said. “Earlier today, Israel announced the results of a preliminary investigation and said that this strike was carried out using the smallest bomb in their arsenal, targeting terrorists 1.7 kilometers (1 mile) away from the Al Mawasi area, where this fire took place,” Miller said. “The IDF is continuing to investigate this matter (and has) promised that its investigation will be swift, comprehensive and transparent. We will be watching those results closely. And we will continue to emphasize to Israel their obligation to comply fully with international humanitarian law, minimize the impact of their operations on civilians, and maximize the flow of humanitarian assistance to those in need,” he said. Miller added that it is important to “find out what the actual cause of the fire is,” noting the Israeli claim that there might a weapons depot nearby. Some background: At least 45 people were killed and 200 others were injured in the strike. Video from the site showed scenes of horror: charred bodies being pulled from rubble, a man holding the headless body of a child, fire raging from tents in the background. At least 29 Palestinians have been killed in two separate Israeli attacks in Rafah on Tuesday, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health and the Emergency Committee of the Rafah Governorate. The first attack happened at around 3 a.m. on Tuesday (local time) in Tal al-Sultan displacement camp in western Rafah when a strike hit three tents, according to residents and a CNN stringer in Rafah. At least eight people were killed and transferred to a field hospital in Tal Al-Sultan camp, according to the committee. The Tal al-Sultan camp is located next to a UN warehouse, whose walls were damaged from the strike according to video from a CNN stringer on the ground. The camp that was hit on Tuesday is about 150 meters away from another displacement camp that an Israeli strike and ensuing fire hit just two days ago, killing at least 45 people and wounding more than 200 others. Video from CNN’s stringer on the ground shows displaced people dismantling their makeshift living arrangements in Tal al-Sultan camp, and gathering their belongings and evacuating the area on trucks and donkey carts. Gaza’s Ministry of Health says a second attack happened on Tuesday afternoon local time when an Israeli strike hit a displacement camp in the southern coastal town of Al-Mawasi, killing at least 21 people, including 13 women, and injuring at least 64 people with 10 in critical condition. However, the Israeli military has denied striking a humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi. It told CNN in a statement: “Contrary to the reports from the last few hours, the IDF did not strike in the humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi.” CNN has followed up, asking if the IDF has struck elsewhere in Al-Mawasi, such as the UN warehouse that is in the vicinity of the camp, but has not received a reply. This post has been updated to include a response from the IDF. Israeli tanks have been seen in central Rafah for the first time in Israel’s seven-month war against Hamas, signaling a new phase of its offensive as Israel presses on despite mounting international pressure. The ground offensive comes just days after Israel launched an airstrike on a displacement camp in the southern Gaza city, killing dozens and sparking global outrage. Meanwhile, three European countries on Tuesday recognized a Palestinian state, and others are considering taking the same step. Here are the latest developments: The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are operating in Rafah in a “targeted” and “precise” way, spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Tuesday, in response to a question on reports of tanks advancing in the southern Gazan city. “Today, and the day before, we’ve again detected tunnels along the Philadelphi Corridor, those are tunnels going to Sinai,” he added. Hagari said the IDF is demolishing the tunnels into Sinai and speaking with the Egyptian government. His comments came shortly after eyewitnesses told CNN that Israeli tanks had reached the center of Rafah – a first in the seven-month war. Some context: The Philadelphi Corridor is a 14-kilometer (about 8.7-mile) long and 100-meter-wide strip of land running along the border between Gaza and Egypt. Israeli troops moved into the corridor and took control of the Rafah crossing earlier this month. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the deadly fire at displacement camp in Rafah was not caused solely by weapons used by the Israeli military. Hagari said the IDF is “looking into all possibilities, including the option that weapons stored in a compound next to our target, which we did not know of, may have ignited as a result of this strike.” Hagari showed aerial footage of a strike on a structure, in which, he says senior Hamas commanders were meeting. He added that the strike used two munitions with small warheads with 17 kilos munitions – “the smallest munitions that our jets could use.” Hagari also said the Israeli military had carried out aerial surveillance assessing the civilian presence in the area before carrying out the strike, “to minimize civilian harm.” The surveillance video released by the IDF shows at least three people on the road near the targeted buildings at the moment of the strike. Alongside the aerial surveillance, Hagari said the Israeli military had delayed the attack “to further assess expected civilian presence.” Some background: At least 45 people were killed and 200 others were injured in the strike. Video from the site showed scenes of horror: charred bodies being pulled from rubble, a man holding the headless body of a child, fire raging from tents in the background. France has called for Israeli operations in Rafah to cease ahead of an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, the foreign ministry said in a statement Tuesday. The statement also called for the UN to be allowed to meet the “immediate needs” of the population and to allow the Palestinians to “govern a territory that must be an integral part of their state.” The ICJ last week ordered Israel to halt its military operation in Rafah, as international pressure mounts on Israel to rein in its assault. Israel has presented mediators with new ideas on the hostage-for-ceasefire, a diplomatic source familiar with the negotiations said Tuesday. The source could not expand on what the new ideas are. The diplomatic source has not heard of any wider meetings happening Tuesday. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas were paused three weeks ago without an agreement. CNN reported Tuesday that Egypt muddied the negotiations after independently changing the terms of a framework that Israel had signed on to and presented it to Hamas who then declared they accepted it. The proposal had been changed without the knowledge of Israel or the other mediators, the US and Qatar, prompting anger and frustration. Hamas announced earlier this month that it had accepted a deal, but Israel swiftly said the terms were “far from” meeting its demands. Israeli military tanks were seen in central Rafah on Tuesday for the first time since the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) entered the southern city earlier this month, two eyewitnesses told CNN. A Rafah resident, Alaa Abu Ibrahim, told CNN that Israeli tanks were seen in Al Awda roundabout in the center of the city. Another Rafah resident, Salma AlKadoomi, said she saw Israeli armored vehicles in the downtown area of the city near the Abu Hashem building. The sighting of tanks comes after Israel launched a missile strike on a displacement camp near Rafah, killing dozens and prompting international calls for Israel to abide by the ruling of the International Court of Justice, which ordered Israel to halt its offensive in the city. Ireland formally recognized the State of Palestine at a government meeting Tuesday. Ireland will appoint an ambassador to the State of Palestinian and a full Irish embassy, to be based in Ramallah. Harris said that a two-state solution is “the only way for Israel and Palestine to live side by side in peace and security,” and called on Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “stop the humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza. Ireland, Norway and Spain each publicly announced plans on May 22 to recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday, which are all now formally in effect. More than 370 trucks carrying humanitarian aid went into Gaza on Monday, including 154 trucks that had arrived at the Kerem Shalom crossing from Egypt, Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) said. Some 70 World Food Programme (WFP) trucks, that had arrived to Ashdod Port, entered Gaza carrying flour, COGAT said. Hundreds of aid trucks have not yet been picked up by UN agencies for distribution inside the territory, COGAT said. The UN have said the retrieval and distribution of aid remains difficult due to the conditions on the ground. UNRWA said on Monday that the aid agency picked up only 30 trucks for distribution on the Gaza side due to heavy movement restrictions, ongoing Israeli airstrikes, the launch of rockets by Hamas and limitations on the routes that can be used. Norway’s foreign minister said Tuesday marks “a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine,” as the country officially recognizes a Palestinian state. “For more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state,” Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement Tuesday, as the country’s formal recognition came into effect. “I have confidence that the Palestinian government will continue the difficult job of reform and lay the foundations for governing both the West Bank and Gaza after a ceasefire.” “The international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution,” he added. Eide handed the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority Mohammed Mustafa “a formal document of recognition” when they met in Brussels on Sunday. Norway, Spain and Ireland each publicly announced plans on May 22 to formally recognize a Palestinian state on May 28. Earlier today, Spain announced it had done so. Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said last week that “there will be no peace in the Middle East without a two-state solution.” Støre added that a Palestinian state was “a prerequisite for achieving peace in the Middle East.” The Spanish government officially recognized a Palestinian state on Tuesday in a cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares told a news conference in Madrid. Just before the cabinet meeting, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said in a nationally televised address that Spain would join “more than 140 countries that already recognize Palestine” and that it “is the only way to realize the solution that we all recognize as the only possible one to achieve a future of peace: that of a Palestinian State that coexists alongside the State of Israel in peace and security.” Spain, Ireland and Norway each publicly announced plans on May 22 to formally recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday. The Slovenian government will consider a proposal this week to recognize an independent Palestinian state, according to Prime Minister Robert Golob. A government meeting on Thursday will consider forwarding “the recognition of Palestine” to the country’s legislature for approval, Golob in a statement. “In the meantime, we will continue to coordinate with a group of like-minded countries in order to create maximum pressure for an immediate ceasefire and release of the hostages,” the prime minister said. Golob initiated the process “of recognizing Palestine as an independent and sovereign state” on May 9. On Sunday, Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon told Al Jazeera: “We’ve decided we have a moral duty, at least a symbolic duty, to give hope to Palestinians with this further step on recognition.” Fajon added there is a need to help “reform Palestinian authorities in Ramallah to be able, one day, also to control Gaza,” as she also expressed hope that “other countries will follow us.” Last week, the governments of Ireland, Norway and Spain announced plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Cameron has weighed in on the airstrike in Rafah that killed at least 45 people on Sunday — many of whom were women and children — calling for the investigation by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to be “swift, comprehensive & transparent.” The foreign secretary also called for an urgent deal “to get hostages out & aid in” and reiterated the need for a pause in fighting to enable work towards a long-term sustainable ceasefire. The Israeli military General Staff’s Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism is investigating the airstrike carried out in Rafah on Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement Monday. In addition to those killed, at least 200 were wounded in the strike on a camp for displaced people in Rafah, according to the government media office in Gaza. Spain will not recognize any changes to Palestinian borders after 1967 “other than those agreed to by the parties,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Tuesday. Spain will approve the official recognition of a Palestinian state today, Sanchez said, just before his cabinet was due to meet to take that step. Norway and Ireland will also formally recognize a Palestinian state from today — a move that will bolster the global Palestinian cause but has further strained relations between Europe and Israel. EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday for the first time engaged in a “significant discussion” on sanctioning Israel if the country doesn’t comply with a ruling from the UN’s top court, Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin said after the meeting. On Friday, the UN’s top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), ordered Israel to immediately halt its controversial military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, further increasing international pressure on Israel over its war against Hamas. Martin said “Israel should adhere to those provisional orders to open the border crossing at Rafah and also to cease its military operation in Rafah.” The Irish foreign minister said that within the EU, “there’s some distance between people articulating the need for a sanctions-based approach” if Israel does not comply with the International Court of Justice’s rulings, versus “an agreement at an EU Council meeting, given all of the different perspectives there.” About one million people have fled Rafah over the past three weeks, according to the UN’s main relief agency in Gaza (UNRWA). “Day after day, providing assistance & protection becomes nearly impossible,” the agency said. Over a million Palestinians had been sheltering in Rafah before Israel ramped up airstrikes and ground operations there, many having fled to the city from other areas of Gaza after Israel launched its war on Hamas. Israel had ordered thousands of civilians to leave some areas of Rafah as it intensified its military operations in the city. Remember: Israel has vowed to press on with its Rafah offensive despite international outrage and a US warning not to proceed. The International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to halt its offensive in the city, adding to the unprecedented level of diplomatic pressure that Netanyahu is facing over the war in Gaza. Days after the ICJ ruling, an Israeli airstrike on a displacement camp in Rafah killed at least 45 people, drawing global condemnation. The Spanish government will approve the official recognition of a Palestinian state today, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said, just before his cabinet was due to meet to take that step. He called the recognition “a historic decision — to contribute to Israelis and Palestinians living in peace.” Norway, Spain and Ireland will formally recognize a Palestinian state from today — a move that will bolster the global Palestinian cause but has further strained relations between Europe and Israel. Formally recognizing a Palestinian state “will not bring Israelis and Palestinians any closer to a comprehensive conflict-ending solution,” a former peace negotiator for the US State Department said Tuesday. Norway, Spain and Ireland will formally recognize a Palestinian state from today — a move that will bolster the global Palestinian cause but has further strained relations between Europe and Israel. “Right now in the wake of the October 7 attack, we are still a very long way away from any sort of negotiation that could create a better pathway to states living alongside in peace and security,” he said. US President Joe Biden told CNN earlier this month that he’d halt some shipments of American weapons to Israel – which he acknowledged have been used to kill civilians in Gaza – if it invades Rafah. In giving Netanyahu this ultimatum in May, Biden set a red line on Israel’s actions in Gaza. Deadly strike: Israel’s strike on a displacement camp in Rafah on Sunday killed at least 45 people and wounded 200 others. It is among the deadliest strikes by the Israeli military on Gaza’s southernmost city since Israel began its operation there on May 7. What the US is saying: Biden is yet to comment publicly on Sunday’s strike. A US National Security Council spokesperson said the strike was “heartbreaking,” and that the US was “actively engaging” with Israel to determine what happened. But the spokesperson also said that “Israel has a right to go after Hamas.” The US has supported Israel’s efforts to go after Hamas while warning against an invasion of Rafah, which would lead to widespread civilian casualties. In recent weeks, Biden’s top national security aide Jake Sullivan engaged Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, emphasizing the US position. Sullivan said he had detected “refinements” to Israel’s Rafah plan, which he said was now more “targeted and limited” in scale. Israel digs in: Last week, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel would expand its ground operation in Rafah. After meeting Sullivan, he said: “I emphasized to him Israel’s duty to expand the ground operation in Rafah, to dismantle Hamas and return the abductees.” Global outcry: The strike on the Rafah camp, which killed and wounded many women and children, has sparked a mounting global outcry. The UN is holding an emergency session on the strike on Tuesday — adding to the unprecedented pressure on Israel over its Gaza offensive, and on its staunch ally the United States. Mounting pressure: It also came just days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to “immediately halt” its military operation in Rafah, and any action in the city “which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.” Spain, Ireland and Norway are set to formally recognize a Palestinian state today — a move that will bolster the global Palestinian cause but has further strained relations between Europe and Israel. The three European nations say their landmark decision is the best way to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East, but it sparked swift condemnation from Israel, as its foreign minister ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors from those countries. Most of the world already recognizes Palestinian statehood: More than 140 out of 193 member states of the United Nations have made their recognition official. But only some nations in the 27-member European Union are among them. Nations that don’t include staunch allies of Israel such as the United States and Germany. On May 10, a non-binding vote at the UN General Assembly showed overwhelming international support for an independent Palestinian state, leaving the US and a few of Israel’s allies isolated. Israel and the US maintain that a Palestinian state should only be established through a negotiated settlement. Pressure on Israel: The planned recognition symbolizes the huge amounts of pressure Israel is under after seven months of war that has devastated Gaza, caused a humanitarian crisis and killed more than 36,000 people in Gaza since October 7. It comes after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to immediately halt its military operation in Rafah. And Israel is facing unprecedented levels of diplomatic pressure to rein in its military offensive in Gaza. Read the full story. Israeli bombings in various areas of Gaza killed at least six people and wounded several others, the Palestinian news agency Wafa said early Tuesday morning, citing medical sources in Gaza. An Israeli strike on a house in the Daraj neighborhood of Gaza City killed at least two people and wounded others, Wafa said. Israeli artillery shelling targeting a tent of displaced people in Tal al-Sultan, northwest of Rafah, killed three people and wounded several others, Wafa reported. Israeli artillery shelling in the city of Rafah killed a young man, according to Wafa. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment. International outcry is mounting over Israel’s airstrike on a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah that killed at least 45 people and wounded 200 others, many of whom were women and children. In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike a “tragic error” and said that Israel was investigating the incident. Footage obtained by CNN showed the camp in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. Graphic video shows scale of devastation in Rafah: The strike came days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to halt its offensive in the city, and several humanitarian organizations have called on the UN Security Council to enforce the court’s orders, saying “immediate action is required.” A growing list of countries, world leaders and aid agencies have now condemned the strike, saying “there is no safe space in Gaza.” Here are some of the international reactions: This post has been updated after additional review of the translation from Hebrew to English, to clarify the wording used by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he referred to a deadly Israeli strike on Rafah, Gaza. The word “error” was originally translated as “mistake”. The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting today to discuss a deadly Israeli airstrike on a displaced person tent camp in the southern Gaza city of Rafah on Sunday, according to a UN diplomat. The meeting was requested by Algeria, the diplomat said. The Security Council will hold private discussions on Tuesday afternoon at 3.30 p.m., the diplomat said. UN Secretary-General Antònio Guterres issued a blistering condemnation on Monday. Palestinians with disabilities in Gaza fear they will be killed first because of limited opportunities to flee due to their impairment, the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons and Disabilities (CRPD) said in a release on Monday. Among the examples cited was that of a 14-year-old girl with cerebral palsy who had lost her assistive devices, including a wheelchair, and had to be carried by her parents while fleeing from the north of Gaza to the south amid Israel’s offensive. At one point, the girl told her family: “Leave me here, and you run away,” the committee said. The girl survived but is at risk of being displaced again, it added. The CPRD called for an immediate ceasefire and underscored the obligation to the Convention on the Rights of Persons and Disabilities, which calls for all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of people with disabilities in situations of risk, including in armed conflict. CNN has previously reported on the struggles of disabled Palestinians in Gaza. The Israeli attack on the Philadelphi corridor creates an “uncontrollable situation, in the field and psychologically, that can lead to an escalation,” Egyptian state-affiliated Al-Qahera News reported on Monday, citing an Egyptian security source. What’s happening: The relationship between Egypt and Israel became tense after Israeli troops moved into an area known as the Philadelphi Corridor and took control of the Rafah crossing earlier this month. The corridor is a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) long and 100-meter-wide strip along the border between Gaza and Egypt. Egypt’s military spokesperson said a person was killed during a shooting Monday on the border. Israel’s military also acknowledged that a “shooting incident” had occurred. Investigations are underway. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Sunday’s deadly Israeli airstrike on a Rafah camp had gone tragically wrong, but that he would not end the war in Gaza until the military’s goals were completed. At least 45 people were killed and 200 wounded after the Israeli strike hit a camp for displaced people, according to the government media office in Gaza. The Israeli military’s General Staff’s Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism is investigating an airstrike carried out in Rafah on Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Monday. Speaking in Hebrew to the Knesset, Netanyahu said he would not “surrender” or “end the war before all its objectives are completed.” This post has been updated after additional review of the translation from Hebrew to English, to clarify the wording used by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he referred to a deadly Israeli strike on Rafah, Gaza. The word “error” was originally translated as “mistake”. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said he will ask European Union member states to officially back the International Court of Justice (ICJ) order for Israel to halt its military operation in Rafah. Speaking Monday alongside the Irish and Norwegian foreign ministers at a news conference in Brussels, Albares said he would ask the other 26 EU members to declare their backing of the ICJ’s decision and that, if Israel opposes the court’s decision, “to take the right measures to enforce that decision and to back one of the most important bodies of the UN charter.” Last week, Spain, Ireland and Norway announced they will formally recognize a Palestinian state. Some background: On Friday, the ICJ ordered Israel to immediately halt its military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, further increasing international pressure on Israel as it wages its war against Hamas. Qatar said Israel’s strike on a Rafah displacement camp could “hinder” ongoing negotiations aiming for the release of hostages and reaching a ceasefire in Gaza. The Qatari foreign ministry said Monday that the strike is a “serious violation of international laws” and expressed concern that it “would complicate the ongoing mediation efforts.” Israel said it killed two Hamas commanders using “precise munitions” in the strike. Gaza health authorities said 35 people were killed, mostly women and children. Video obtained by CNN shows tent-like structures on fire and charred bodies being pulled from rubble. Talks to resume: Negotiations between Israel and Hamas for a ceasefire-and-hostage-swap deal are set to resume in Cairo on Tuesday, according to an Egyptian official. Talks between Israel and Hamas have stalled for months, with both parties failing to reach an agreement over differences on key demands. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed strong opposition to the demands made by Hamas. The Kuwaiti Hospital in central Rafah was forced to close on Monday after the Israeli military attacks increased around the hospital. Recent, “repeated and deliberate” attacks by Israeli forces had led to the death of two staff working in the hospital, as well as the injury of five medical staff, according to Dr. Suhaib Al-Hims, director of the Kuwaiti hospital. The remaining medical teams were being transferred to a field hospital that is being prepared in the Al-Mawasi area of Gaza, Al-Hims said. Earlier on Monday, the Ministry of Health in Gaza reported that an Israeli drone strike killed two staff members while they were on duty in front of the gate. They were identified as Rashid Mohammed Saeed Barhoum, 23, and Musab Sami Dakhlallah Al-Araj, 22. Several global aid organizations penned a joint letter on Monday calling on the UN Security Council to enforce the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) orders that Israel “immediately halt” its

cnn,India’s election campaign turns negative as Modi and ruling party embrace Islamophobic rhetoric,"May 29, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/28/india/india-narendra-modi-hate-speech-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is increasingly resorting to overtly Islamophobic language during his election campaign, critics and observers say, as he seeks a third straight term governing the world’s most populous nation. As turnout in the polls so far shows a slight dip from five years ago, the popular leader – and overwhelming favorite – has embraced negative campaigning, they say, and received little pushback from civil society or election authorities. Followers of Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – and some of its top figures – have long been accused of using inflammatory language to describe the country’s 200 million Muslims, but rarely Modi himself. However this election has brought a clear shift, critics say. “What is unique about what we’ve seen recently, is that these statements are being uttered by the Prime Minister himself,” Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow and director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Not necessarily by surrogates – the Home Minister, or by the chief minister – or by other kind of party apparatchiks.” The shift in tone is making many Indian Muslims nervous. “Modi and the BJP have for a long time been making references to the community, but it’s moved on from the dog whistle,” said political researcher and columnist Asim Ali. “It’s painting us as an existential threat to Hindus. It’s coming directly from the prime minister. It’s anti-Muslim, and it’s dangerous.” Modi and his BJP have repeatedly said they do not discriminate against minority groups. But analysts and observers have noted multiple speeches he’s made during this six-week election campaign, that began last month, specifically refer to Muslims and paint them in a negative light. Calling Muslims “infiltrators” with “large families,” Modi has accused his main opposition, the Indian National Congress, without evidence, of intending to redistribute the country’s wealth to Muslims. He warned women that the opposition would take their gold and redistribute it to Muslims. He accused Congress of wanting to choose players on the Indian cricket team “on the basis of religion.” And he has claimed the party is conspiring to commit “vote jihad” by uniting “a certain community” against him. The BJP did not respond to a request for comment on the rhetoric being used by party leaders during this campaign. BJP national spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill previously told CNN that the party is not prejudiced against Muslims, and the community has benefited from Modi’s leadership. For Irfan Nooruddin, a professor of Indian politics at Georgetown University, the rhetoric has “become much more starkly and overtly communal.” “These are very central views within the BJP that are sometimes suppressed to avoid negative press or civil society pushback. With the media and civil society neutralized, the BJP no longer fears such consequences and so can pull back the veil,” he said. “The BJP understands that its path to a majority in parliament – especially a super-majority that would allow it to amend the constitution – is to consolidate the Hindu vote and to prevent the opposition from making inroads through economic appeals,” added Nooruddin. The prime minister has set an ambitious target for his alliance to win 400 seats in the country’s Lok Sabha, or lower house of Parliament, in this election. Many in the country say their lives have been transformed under his leadership, aided by his far-reaching welfare and development schemes. Weeks before voting began, analysts were certain his party would sweep the polls yet again. Since April 19, millions have flocked to polling booths to cast their vote. But turnout across six phases so far has slightly dipped from the record highs of 2019, and this might be causing anxiety among BJP leaders, analysts say. The chief minister of Delhi, popular opposition leader and staunch Modi critic, Arvind Kejriwal, was temporarily allowed out of prison earlier this month after being arrested on corruption charges, in a case his allies claimed was politically motivated. His release has galvanized a once flattened opposition, uniting them to deliver a tough fight to Modi and his BJP. “This election is becoming competitive,” said political researcher Ali, suggesting that a tighter race in key seats might be motivating the ruling party to ramp up the inflammatory language. “The BJP is a favorite but their target is ambitious, and this rhetoric appeals to their vote bank.” Many have accused the prime minister of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his Hindu-nationalist credentials, while diverting from policy failures – such as youth unemployment, which now stands at close to 50% among 20- to 24-year-olds, and the vast wealth gap in the country, which according to a recent study is more unequal than it was during British rule. “The BJP’s track record on economic growth, job creation, and poverty alleviation is weak,” Nooruddin, from Georgetown University, said. “These bread-and-butter issues are central to election campaigns and the opposition has really sought to emphasize them. So, I think the BJP’s resort to overt communal rhetoric is an effort to fight an election on its preferred terms rather than on issues where it is vulnerable.” Muslim independent journalist Alishan Jafri noted that the day-to-day struggles brought by poverty and unemployment are “affecting Muslims as much as it’s affecting poor Hindus,” pointing to some 800 million people dependent on rations provided by the government. “To tell (Hindus) that Muslims will take away even half of that is surely going to scare them and divide the communities on religious lines. That the mainstream media has refused to push back tells us two things: they are compromised, or they support it.” Modi’s government posits India as a leader on the global stage. His calendar last year included diplomatic trips to Australia and the United States, and he presents himself as a statesman cementing the country as a modern power. Last year India overtook China to become the world’s most populous nation, while the year before it surpassed former colonial power Britain to become the world’s fifth-largest economy. According to Vaishnav, the muted response to Modi’s divisive language from Western leaders must be seen through the prism through which they view India – as a balance against an increasingly assertive China. At home, analysts say, his grip on power has allowed him to make such comments with little pushback from civil society. “The Election Commission is pretty toothless and what powers it has had have been further weakened by changes made to how commissioners are appointed by making the Prime Minister’s Office more central to that process,” Nooruddin said. Modi’s April 21 speech about “infiltrators” has ignited widespread anger among Muslim leaders and opposition politicians, and calls for election authorities to investigate. BJP party spokespeople subsequently said Modi was talking specifically about undocumented migrants. The election commission has asked the BJP to respond to the allegations. But opposition groups and critics say the response is not strong enough. Globally, independent polls suggest that India’s image is declining in some countries around the world and there is some criticism about the government’s Hindu nationalist ambitions. “The anti-Muslim rhetoric used on the campaign trail will unfortunately further damage India’s reputation globally. This is unnecessary at a time when India should be ascendant,” Nooruddin said. For Jafri, the journalist, the effects are clear. “I can’t express what millions of people feel as a collective, but I am sure that nobody likes being constantly abused, bullied, betrayed, and singled out,” he said. “Some feel attacked and humiliated. Many have become cynical, and they don’t expect any better from this regime and its supporters.”",indian prime minister narendra modi increasingly resorting overtly islamophobic language election

cnn,Modi’s latest campaign message to supporters: ‘God has sent me’,"May 28, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/28/india/india-narendra-modi-chosen-by-god-intl-hnk/index.html,"India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a new message for supporters on the campaign trail: God has chosen him. “I’m convinced that God has sent me for a purpose, and when that purpose is finished, my work will be done,” he told local news channel NDTV in an interview last week. “This is why I have dedicated myself to God.” Modi continued: “God doesn’t reveal his cards. He just keeps making me do things.” Since assuming power in 2014, Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have promoted a strident brand of Hindu nationalism in a country where about 80% of the population are followers of the polytheistic faith. And while he has used such language in the past, his message of being a leader chosen by God has become much more apparent as attempts to win a third consecutive five-year term in power. Throughout India’s mammoth weeks-long national election, which declares results on June 4, Modi has given multiple media interviews and speeches that echo the comments made to NDTV. He has taken on the persona of an openly devout Hindu, said Subir Sinha, Director of the South Asia Institute at SOAS University of London. This, he added has “rallied his base who feel pride in such religiosity.” India is a deeply religious country. But historically its post-Independence leaders have remained publicly secular, in part to avoid being seen to pander to any one side in a nation with a long history of inter-religious violence. “(He is) the first prime minister, they say, to be unashamed about this faith,” Sinha said. When he first contested elections a decade ago, Modi chose India’s spiritual capital Varanasi as his constituency, making the ancient city the perfect backdrop to meld his religious and political ambitions. “Mother Ganga has called me to Varanasi,” Modi said at the time, referring to the holy Ganges River, considered to be the body of the Hindu deity Ganga by many followers of the faith. Standing on its banks earlier this month, Modi made another reference to his perceived divinity. “Until my mother was alive, I had believed that perhaps my birth was a biological one,” Modi told CNN affiliate CNN News-18. “But after her death, when I look at my life experiences, I’m convinced that God has sent me here.” God has, Modi said, made him “nothing but an instrument.” Modi’s grandest display of divinity was on display in January this year, when he consecrated the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, a controversial Hindu temple that was built on the site of a destroyed mosque. Billboards celebrating the temple’s opening featured an image of Hindu deity Ram alongside Modi’s face, with the leader of his BJP even dubbing the prime minister “The King of Gods.” Modi fasted for 11 days in a purification ritual before the event and visited temples across the country, performing customs sacramental to India’s majority faith. He publicly called himself “an instrument” of Lord Ram, picked by the divine to “represent all the people of India.” At the consecration, Modi presided over the “Pran Pratishtha” – the unveiling of the much-anticipated Ram idol – taking on a role typically reserved for priests. During the election Modi has also sparked a row over hate speech when he accused Muslims – who have been part of India for centuries – of being “infiltrators,” and echoing a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists that Muslims are displacing the country’s Hindu population by deliberately having large families. It ignited widespread anger among Muslim leaders and opposition politicians and calls for election authorities to investigate. BJP party spokespeople subsequently said Modi was talking about undocumented migrants. The election commission has asked the BJP to respond to the allegations.",india prime minister narendra modi new message supporter campaign trail god chosen im convinced god sent purpose purpose finished work done told local news channel ndtv interview last week dedicated god modi continued god doesnt reveal card keep making thing since assuming power modi bharatiya janata party bjp promoted strident brand hindu nationalism country population follower polytheistic faith used language past message leader chosen god become much apparent attempt win third consecutive fiveyear term power throughout india mammoth weekslong national election declares result june modi given multiple medium interview speech echo comment made ndtv taken persona openly devout hindu said subir sinha director south asia institute soas university london added rallied base feel pride religiosity india deeply religious country historically postindependence leader remained publicly secular part avoid seen pander one side nation long history interreligious violence first prime minister say unashamed faith sinha said first contested election decade ago modi chose india spiritual capital varanasi constituency making ancient city perfect backdrop meld religious political ambition mother ganga called varanasi modi said time referring holy ganges river considered body hindu deity ganga many follower faith standing bank earlier month modi made another reference perceived divinity mother alive believed perhaps birth biological one modi told cnn affiliate cnn news death look life experience im convinced god sent god modi said made nothing instrument modis grandest display divinity display january year consecrated ram mandir ayodhya controversial hindu temple built site destroyed mosque billboard celebrating temple opening featured image hindu deity ram alongside modis face leader bjp even dubbing prime minister king god modi fasted day purification ritual event visited temple across country performing custom sacramental india majority faith publicly called instrument lord ram picked divine represent people india consecration modi presided pran pratishtha unveiling muchanticipated ram idol taking role typically reserved priest election modi also sparked row hate speech accused muslim part india century infiltrator echoing false conspiracy voiced hindu nationalist muslim displacing country hindu population deliberately large family ignited widespread anger among muslim leader opposition politician call election authority investigate bjp party spokespeople subsequently said modi talking undocumented migrant election commission asked bjp respond allegation,5.0,neutral,2
cnn,India celebrates historic Grand Prix win at the Cannes Film Festival,"May 28, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/27/style/payal-kapadia-india-cannes-grand-prix-intl-hnk/index.html,"Filmmaker Payal Kapadia made history Saturday, as she became the first person from India to clinch the prestigious Grand Prix at the 77th Cannes Film Festival, the second highest prize after the Palme d’Or. Kapadia’s film “All We Imagine As Light” is a drama centered on two Malayali nurses who have moved to a beautifully-shot Mumbai, and are navigating life, love and sisterhood. It is the first Indian movie in three decades to compete in Cannes’ main competition. “It was already a dream to be selected in competition and this was beyond my imagination,” Kapadia said in her acceptance speech, turning to face the Cannes’ jury, which this year include director Greta Gerwig and actor Lily Gladstone. “Please don’t wait another 30 years to have an Indian film,” she said to the audience. The win has reverberated across the country, with many on social media including top politicians, remarking on its significance. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on X that the country was “proud” of Kapadia’s “historic feat.” “Her remarkable talent continues to shine on the global stage, giving a glimpse of the rich creativity in India. This prestigious accolade not only honors her exceptional skills but also inspires a new generation of Indian filmmakers.” Rahul Gandhi, a leader of India’s main opposition political party, the Indian National Congress, also congratulated the director, along with Anasuya Sengupta, the first Indian actor to win Best Actress for her role in “The Shameless,” in the festival’s Un Certain Regard section. “Indian stars shining bright… These women have scripted history, and inspired the entire Indian film fraternity,” he wrote on the platform. Sooni Taraporevala, the screenwriter on “Salaam Bombay!” which won the festival’s Camera d’Or in 1988, told CNN that Kapadia’s “unprecedented” win “has personally touched women and those in the indie film space.” “(It’s) allowed us to dream and hope and celebrate her with unabashed pride and joy,” she said, adding that India’s independent film scene can feel “hopeless” in an industry “dominated” by mainstream productions. “All We Imagine As Light” received an eight-minute standing ovation when it premiered during the festival. Some have pointed to the film’s depiction of the romance between main character Prabha (Kani Kusruti) and her Muslim boyfriend (Hridhu Haroon) as particularly bold, given the country has become increasingly polarized along religious lines. India is the largest film producing country in the world, but still lags behind Hollywood when it comes to making movies that gain international recognition and pick up major awards. Last year the Telegu-language historical fantasy “RRR” became the country’s first feature film to win an Oscar for best original song. The tune “Naatu Naatu” was praised for its catchy beat and vibrant dance moves. “The Elephant Whisperers,” directed by Indian filmmaker Kartiki Gonsalves, also took the prize for best documentary short at the ceremony. In 1947, filmmaker Chetan Anand took Cannes’ top prize for his film “Neecha Nagar,” becoming the only Indian to win the accolade. Kapadia had previously won the festival’s L’Oeil d’Or award in 2021 for her acclaimed documentary “A Night of Knowing Nothing,” about how a film student in India tries to continue a relationship with her ex, despite being from a different caste.",filmmaker payal kapadia made history saturday became first person india clinch prestigious grand prix th cannes film festival second highest prize palme dor kapadias film imagine light drama centered two malayali nurse moved beautifullyshot mumbai navigating life love sisterhood first indian movie three decade compete cannes main competition already dream selected competition beyond imagination kapadia said acceptance speech turning face cannes jury year include director greta gerwig actor lily gladstone please dont wait another year indian film said audience win reverberated across country many social medium including top politician remarking significance india prime minister narendra modi said x country proud kapadias historic feat remarkable talent continues shine global stage giving glimpse rich creativity india prestigious accolade honor exceptional skill also inspires new generation indian filmmaker rahul gandhi leader india main opposition political party indian national congress also congratulated director along anasuya sengupta first indian actor win best actress role shameless festival un certain regard section indian star shining bright woman scripted history inspired entire indian film fraternity wrote platform sooni taraporevala screenwriter salaam bombay festival camera dor told cnn kapadias unprecedented win personally touched woman indie film space allowed u dream hope celebrate unabashed pride joy said adding india independent film scene feel hopeless industry dominated mainstream production imagine light received eightminute standing ovation premiered festival pointed film depiction romance main character prabha kani kusruti muslim boyfriend hridhu haroon particularly bold given country become increasingly polarized along religious line india largest film producing country world still lag behind hollywood come making movie gain international recognition pick major award last year telegulanguage historical fantasy rrr became country first feature film win oscar best original song tune naatu naatu praised catchy beat vibrant dance move elephant whisperer directed indian filmmaker kartiki gonsalves also took prize best documentary short ceremony filmmaker chetan anand took cannes top prize film neecha nagar becoming indian win accolade kapadia previously festival loeil dor award acclaimed documentary night knowing nothing film student india try continue relationship ex despite different caste,91.0,positive,2
cnn,Fire at gaming arcade kills at least 20 people in India,"May 27, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/25/asia/fire-arcade-india-intl-latam/index.html,"At least 20 people are dead after a fire broke out at an arcade in the western Indian city of Rajkot on Saturday, local officials said.

cnn,India’s ‘King of Bollywood’ is ‘doing well’ after heatstroke hospitalization reports,"May 24, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/23/india/india-shah-rukh-khan-hospitalized-heat-wave-intl-hnk/index.html,"Shah Rukh Khan’s manager has said India’s “King of Bollywood” is recovering well after reports he was hospitalized with heatstroke, as parts of the country swelter during a weeks-long general election. The 58-year-old superstar was admitted for treatment on Wednesday in the city of Ahmedabad in western Gujarat state, police told local reporters. Maximum temperatures there climbed to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) this week. “To all of Mr Khan’s fans and well wishers - he is doing well. Thank you for your love, prayers and concern,” his manager Pooja Dadlani wrote on X on Thursday. Khan “was admitted to K D Hospital after suffering from a heat stroke,” the Press Trust of India reported Wednesday, citing Ahmedabad (Rural) Superintendent of Police Om Prakash Jat. Video broadcast by a local news agency showed Khan’s wife, Gauri, arriving at the hospital on Thursday morning to visit him. CNN has contacted KD Hospital for comment. Also known as “King Khan,” the actor has near-demigod status in India, having starred in more than 90 movies and earned multiple accolades. He received India’s fourth-highest civilian honor in 2005, and a spot on Time magazine’s 100 most influential list in 2022. Khan was in Ahmedabad to attend an Indian Premier League cricket match between the Kolkata Knight Riders, a team he co-owns, and the Sunrisers Hyderabad. His hospitalization comes as heatwave conditions continue to engulf parts of the country, causing illness and forcing some schools to shut, as temperatures once again rise to levels that threaten human limits of survivability. Temperatures soared beyond 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in various cities in the north this week, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which has issued a warning for a “severe heatwave” in the states of Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, and the capital territory of Delhi. Authorities in Delhi this week ordered schools to shut early for the summer holidays after temperatures hit 47.4 degrees Celsius (117 Fahrenheit), while Barmer city in Rajasthan recorded a maximum temperature of 48 degrees Celsius (118 Fahrenheit) on Wednesday, according to the IMD. Temperatures are expected to remain high for the next few days, it said. The severe heat comes as the nation of 1.4 billion people carries out a national election. Delhi, a city of more than 11 million, will head to the polls on Sunday. The country often experiences heatwaves during the summer months of May and June, but in recent years they have arrived earlier and become more prolonged. Experts say the climate crisis is only going to cause more frequent and longer heatwaves in the future, testing India’s ability to adapt. India is among the countries expected to be worst affected by the climate crisis, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, threatening its development while risking reversing its progress on poverty alleviation, health and economic growth.",shah rukh khan manager said india king bollywood recovering well report hospitalized heatstroke part country swelter weekslong general election yearold superstar admitted treatment wednesday city ahmedabad western gujarat state police told local reporter maximum temperature climbed degree celsius degree fahrenheit week mr khan fan well wishers well thank love prayer concern manager pooja dadlani wrote x thursday khan admitted k hospital suffering heat stroke press trust india reported wednesday citing ahmedabad rural superintendent police om prakash jat video broadcast local news agency showed khan wife gauri arriving hospital thursday morning visit cnn contacted kd hospital comment also known king khan actor neardemigod status india starred movie earned multiple accolade received india fourthhighest civilian honor spot time magazine influential list khan ahmedabad attend indian premier league cricket match kolkata knight rider team coowns sunrisers hyderabad hospitalization come heatwave condition continue engulf part country causing illness forcing school shut temperature rise level threaten human limit survivability temperature soared beyond degree celsius fahrenheit various city north week according india meteorological department imd issued warning severe heatwave state rajasthan punjab haryana uttar pradesh capital territory delhi authority delhi week ordered school shut early summer holiday temperature hit degree celsius fahrenheit barmer city rajasthan recorded maximum temperature degree celsius fahrenheit wednesday according imd temperature expected remain high next day said severe heat come nation billion people carry national election delhi city million head poll sunday country often experience heatwaves summer month may june recent year arrived earlier become prolonged expert say climate crisis going cause frequent longer heatwaves future testing india ability adapt india among country expected worst affected climate crisis according intergovernmental panel climate change threatening development risking reversing progress poverty alleviation health economic growth,-7.0,negative,2
cnn,"May 22, 2024 Israel-Hamas war","May 23, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/iran-israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-05-22-24/index.html,"Our live coverage is over for Wednesday. Please scroll through the posts below to learn about what happened in the region today. Colombian President Gustavo Petro ordered the opening of an embassy in the Palestinian city of Ramallah, Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo said Wednesday. Murillo told reporters the move is part of the foreign policy objective Petro is promoting together with other governments to recognize a Palestinian state. The announcement was made hours after Spain, Ireland and Norway said they would recognize a Palestinian state, and weeks after Petro announced that Colombia would break diplomatic relations with Israel over its actions in Gaza. Murillo reiterated Wednesday that Colombia condemns the aggressions of Hamas, but rejects Israel’s response. He also argued that the intention to open an embassy in Ramallah is not a measure against Israel but rather in favor of the two states. It’s unclear when a Colombian embassy in Ramallah would open and what steps would need to be taken to do so. CNN has reached out to the Israeli embassy in Colombia for comment. Spain, Norway and Ireland on Wednesday announced plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the countries of supporting terror and Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors from those countries. The recognition will come into force on May 28. Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin said Ireland’s decision followed “growing impatience” with Israel’s lack of political will for a two-state solution. Here’s what else you should know: More on the Palestinian recognition announcement Newly released hostage footage More Palestinian deaths: Other developments in the United States House Speaker Mike Johnson said he spoke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this afternoon and they are working to coordinate a date for the Israeli leader to give a joint address to Congress. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs is considering further diplomatic steps against Norway, Ireland and Spain after they declared their intention to recognize a Palestinian state, according to a source familiar with the matter. Steps under consideration include canceling visits by officials from these countries to Israel and revoking visas from the countries’ diplomats, which would limit their ability to visit areas in the West Bank under the control of the Palestinian Authority. Israel is also considering reaching out to the United States to seek diplomatic support in providing clarification from Norway, Ireland and Spain on their intended decision, and to ask the US to try and convince other countries not to follow suit. An Israeli military operation in the West Bank city of Jenin killed at least 11 Palestinian people, according to an updated death toll from officials. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah said Israelis killed 10 Palestinians, adding that 25 people have been injured, with four of them injured seriously. In addition, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said crews recovered one more dead person from Haifa Street in Jenin after receiving a report of injuries. The PRCS said the victim was taken to the hospital and that the area around Haifa Street site was being searched for other possible victims. Since October 7 of last year, 517 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and Jerusalem, according to Palestinian officials. Ireland’s decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state came amid “growing impatience” with Israel’s lack of political will for a two-state solution, the country’s Foreign Minister Micheál Martin said Wednesday. “The integrity of that two-state solution has been undermined in recent years by the strategy of the Israeli government and, particularly, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has declared opposition to it,” Martin told CNN’s Richard Quest. Martin also said that Netanyahu “hasn’t really dealt with the violent settlers” in the West Bank, who continue to attack Palestinians. Martin acknowledged however, that within the European Union “there are different perspectives on this, some for historic reasons,” but “there are a lot of like-minded states within the European Union that have been engaged on this issue.” Alongside Ireland, Spain and Norway also announced plans on Wednesday to formally recognize a Palestinian state next week. US House Speaker Mike Johnson is set to speak with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, days after the International Criminal Court announced it is seeking an arrest warrant for the Israeli leader. Ahead of the call, Johnson said he spoke with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and agreed to sign the invitation for Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress. Johnson said House Republican leaders are getting down to the “fine points” on how to respond to the ICC. Johnson confirmed Monday they were looking at sanctions in response to the decision. Meanwhile, GOP Rep. Michael McCaul, the House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, said he plans to speak with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday about legislation to sanction the international tribunal. Remember: The ICC is seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders: Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, the leader of the Al Qassem Brigades who is better known as Mohammed Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ political leader. CNN’s Morgan Rimmer, Ivana Kottasová, Madalena Araujo and Lauren Fox contributed to this post. This post has been updated with additional information. A top White House aide acknowledged concern on Wednesday about Israel’s potentially growing diplomatic isolation amid its latest spat with several European countries after they moved to recognize a Palestinian state. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that the situation raises concern for Israel’s security. Sullivan, who travelled to Israel and other countries in the Middle East this past weekend, said that it was an issue that he discussed with the Israeli government. “That’s something that we discussed with the Israeli government and something that we believe that a strategic approach to defeating Hamas, protecting civilians surging humanitarian assistance, and then pursuing that vision of regional integration I just talked about, will put Israel in the best stead to engage countries around the world and revitalize a lot of the partnerships and friendships that have been a source of great strength for Israel overtime and can be again,” Sullivan said. Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide rejected Israel’s characterization that the decision to recognize Palestinian statehood rewards Hamas. The recognition of a Palestinian state will come into force in Norway, along with Ireland and Spain, on May 28. Eide called remarks from Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz — who said the decision awards “a gold medal” to Hamas — “absolutely wrong.” “We are sending the opposite signal,” Eide said. “We are supporting the Palestine Authorities which spring out of the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization], who renounce violence and who many decades ago promised to leave the violent struggle behind and work for peaceful settlement with Israel—a promise they have kept by the way.” The foreign minister also called the move “an anti-Hamas measure.” “What we are strengthening are the forces in the region and in Palestine who believe in peace with Israel and who detest the work of Iran and its proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis,” he added. The White House rejected criticism of US humanitarian efforts amid reports that aid from a US-build pier off the coast of Gaza hasn’t been delivered to the broader Palestinian population. Sullivan added that while there has been challenges, about 695 metric tons of food has been delivered through the pier and about two thirds of that either has gone or is on the way toward Palestinian civilians. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan criticized Israel for withholding funds for the Palestinian Authority after several European nations moved to recognize a Palestinian state. “I think it’s wrong. I think it’s wrong on a strategic basis because withholding funds destabilizes the West Bank; it undermines the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people, which is in Israel’s interest,” Sullivan told reporters on Wednesday. “And I think it’s wrong to withhold funds that provide basic goods and service to innocent people,” he said. He also called on Israel to release the funds. Sullivan also noted earlier that the US position remains clear and that the Biden administration does not agree with unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. “President Biden believes that a two-state solution that guarantees Israel’s security, and also a future of dignity and security for the Palestinian people, is the best way to bring about long-term security and stability for everyone, Israeli and Palestinian,” he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he is “horrified by the video showing the abduction” of Israeli Defense Forces field observers. The families of the seven female Israeli soldiers captured by Hamas during the October 7 attacks released the graphic footage of their abduction to pile pressure on Netanyahu to secure their release. Five of the seven remain in captivity. Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz said the video made his “stomach turn,” adding that the “responsibility of leaders is not only to look reality in the eye — it is to create a different reality even when it comes to difficult decisions. And that is our responsibility.” Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a post on X that five of the Israeli soldiers were taken from a lookout post in southern Israel “are all still in Hamas captivity and we are fighting to bring them home as well as all other hostages.” United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Egypt a “critical partner” in ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas — but he did not comment specifically on CNN’s reporting that Egypt ultimately scuttled a deal by quietly changing the terms of the proposal. “I can’t comment on the details of the negotiations,” said Blinken in response to a question from Democratic Rep. Grace Meng at a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing about the reporting. The top US diplomat said that while Egypt is also a “critical partner” in getting humanitarian assistance into Gaza, he does have “deep concern” about the closing of the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza that was recently seized by Israel. “It’s important, I think, politically, for the Egyptians to show that they are a critical actor in providing assistance,” Blinken said, adding that it would still be challenging to reopen the crossing “because of combat activities … near and around the gate.” Egypt’s response: In response to a request for comment from the Egyptian government, a senior Egyptian source told CNN, “Some parties play a game of accusing the mediators, blaming and accusing them of bias in order to evade making the required decisions. Egypt is surprised by the attempts of some parties to deliberately insult the Egyptian efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza.” Diaa Rashwan, the head of Egypt’s State Information Services, then issued a lengthy response calling the story “wrong” and “devoid of any information or facts,” without offering specifics. “The ongoing attempts to cast doubt and insult the Egyptian mediation efforts and roles, with allegations that contradict reality, will only lead to further complicating the situation in Gaza and the entire region, and may push the Egyptian side to take a decision to withdraw completely from their mediation role in the current conflict,” Rashwan said in a statement. CNN’s Michael Callahan contributed reporting to this post. This post has been updated with Egypt’s response to CNN’s story. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused European countries that plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state next week of supporting terror. “The intention of a number of countries in Europe to recognize a Palestinian state is a reward for terror,” he said in a statement released by his office. Ireland, Spain and Norway earlier Wednesday announced plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state, which will come into effect on May 28. “A reward for terror will not bring about peace - and also will not stop us from winning over Hamas,” Netanyahu continued. Families of seven female Israeli soldiers captured by Hamas during the October 7 attacks have released graphic footage of their abduction as they pile pressure on the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure their release. The video shows the women — all Israel Defense Forces personnel — lined up against a wall, with their hands tied up. The faces of some of the women are bruised and bloodied. The footage was previously released by Hamas, according to the Hostage and Missing Families Forum. The campaigning group obtained it from the IDF, which had previously edited the video to exclude the most disturbing scenes. The kidnapped women were working as IDF observers, a role that involves monitoring Israel’s border security. Video of the ordeal has been made public as pressure mounts on Netanyahu to secure the release of the Israelis still held by Hamas, which his government has made a key goal of the Gaza offensive. Numerous attempts to strike a hostage-for-ceasefire deal with Hamas have faltered in recent months, infuriating those in Israel campaigning for the return of the captives. Keep reading about the footage. Spain, Norway and Ireland have announced plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a decision that has angered Israel, prompting the country to immediately recall their ambassadors from each country — with the embassy in Ireland saying it shows “terrorism pays.” The recognition will come into force in all three countries on May 28, Irish foreign minister Micheál Martin said, with the prime ministers of the countries hailing the decision as an “important step” toward “peace” in the region. Here’s how some nations are reacting: Meanwhile in Gaza and the West Bank: In Iran: Officials from Russia, India and Turkey are starting to arrive at the funeral of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. Iran is expected to host 60 delegations from different countries for the funeral, according to semi-official Mehr News Agency, citing Mohsen Mansouri, Iran’s vice president of executive affairs and the head of the funeral planning committee. Here are some of the officials attending: Special envoys were also sent by Oman, Kuwait, Jordan and Syria. Those in attendance also included representatives from Iran-backed armed groups in the Middle East, including: Some context: Tehran wields significant influence on several militias closely tied to the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen have carried out dozens of attacks on US forces and Israel since the war in Gaza began on October 7. This post has been updated with additional officials. Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Wednesday rescinded orders barring Israelis from parts of the northern West Bank, paving the way for the reestablishment of Israeli settlements there that were evacuated and demolished in 2005. Gallant’s move, which he hailed as “historic,” follows through on the Israeli parliament’s repeal last year of a 2005 disengagement law, which barred Israelis from entering the area of four former settlements in the northern West Bank. Israelis can now enter the area of all four former settlements without military restrictions. Israeli settlements in that area would still need government approval, but Gallant’s decision could make it easier for settlers to establish illegal settlement outposts, which have flourished in recent years. All Israeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law. Yossi Dagan, head of the Samaria Regional Council, echoed Gallant’s comments, saying it was a “historic moment of historical correction” and “necessary” for Israel after the October 7 Hamas attacks. “The State of Israel today corrected in a state and official manner the injustice and folly of the deportation from northern Samaria,” Dagan said. He further congratulated Gallant for the “worthy and valuable” decision for Israel and Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fox for signing this “important amendment. ” The Israeli embassy in Ireland has slammed the decision by Ireland, Spain, and Norway to recognize Palestinian statehood, saying it “sends a message” that “terrorism pays.” On Tuesday, the Israeli foreign ministry posted a video on its social media channels, warning Ireland that it risked becoming a “pawn” of Hamas and Iran if went ahead with plans to recognize the Palestinian state. Responding to the announcement from Ireland, Norway and Spain on Wednesday, the Israeli embassy said their decision “brings more questions than answers.” The embassy alleged recognizing Palestinian statehood in the wake of the October 7 attacks carried out by Hamas “sends a message” that “terrorism pays.” It also warned that such a move “jeopardizes” any possibility of Hamas releasing the hostages still being held in Gaza. Tensions have been mounting between the Israeli ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich and the Irish government for weeks. In April, Irish foreign minister, Micheál Martin rebuffed an accusation from Erlich that recognizing Palestinian statehood would amount to a “reward” for terrorism, describing her remarks as an “absurd and unacceptable assertion.” Michael Roth, the chair of the German parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee has questioned Spain, Ireland and Norway’s decision to recognize Palestinian statehood. Germany’s position has long been to advocate for a two-state solution. In April, its foreign ministry said in a statement posted on X that “Germany is not a party in the conflict in the Middle East” and added: “to the contrary, Germany is working day and night for a two-state solution.” A foreign office spokesperson reiterated that view and cautioned this required a process of dialogue, during a regularly held government news conference on Wednesday, according to Reuters. Three European countries’ plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state may not have any meaningful impact on the ground, but it carries political and symbolic weight. Spain, Norway and Ireland on Wednesday pledged to join more than 140 other nations that have recognized Palestinian statehood. That recognition however is unilateral and does not mean a Palestinian state will be recognized by the United Nations, where the Palestinian state only has observer status. The planned recognition does, however, add pressure on Israel as it fights a controversial war in Gaza. Most of the international community considers the enclave, the West Bank and East Jerusalem as occupied Palestinian territory. If more nations join, Israel could find itself further isolated on the world stage as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to reject the prospect of an independent Palestinian state as a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Hellyer said the Jewish state risks becoming an “international pariah” given that Western nations are now beginning to recognize a Palestinian state. While many countries recognize Palestinian statehood, few Western nations do — with the exception of some European Union states that had granted recognition when they were part of the Soviet Union. “Western support for Israel is the bedrock of Israel’s security architecture,” Hellyer said. “It is deeply, deeply linked.” The majority 193-member UN General Assembly has previously voted in favor of granting the state of Palestine full membership in the UN. Israel’s US ally has however blocked Palestine’s bid for membership during the Security Council vote in April. Europe has struggled over the Middle East for a very long time. The decision by Ireland, Spain and Norway to recognize a Palestinian state tells us more about the domestic politics of those countries than anything else. Obviously, the decision of three European nations to take this step is newsworthy and will have repercussions diplomatically, perhaps putting pressure on their allies to take a firmer stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict. However, it is also reasonable to say that thus far, no amount of pressure from even the US has had a major impact on the thinking of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel responded by recalling the ambassadors of Ireland and Norway, accusing them of supporting terror. Conversations about what recognition of statehood practically means and how helpful it is to the Palestinian cause in the long run are all entirely valid. But the reality is that the stakes are quite low for the majority of European countries when it comes to issues relating to Israel and the Palestinians. In Ireland, Spain and Norway, support for a Palestinian state chimes with the broader electorate and is unlikely to receive any political blowback. That isn’t necessarily the case in other European countries. While supporting a peaceful two-state solution in the long-term, Germany has been consistent in its support for Israel, as have Hungary, Poland, the UK and others. Read more about what the recognition of a Palestinian state might achieve here. The Biden administration pushed back against a move from Spain, Norway, and Ireland Wednesday to recognize a Palestinian state, reiterating that while the US president backs a path to a two-state solution, it would continue to pursue one through diplomatic negotiations between the two parties. Over the weekend, President Joe Biden said he supported a two-state solution in remarks at Morehouse College’s commencement, calling it “the only solution where two people live in peace, security, and dignity.” On a call with reporters Tuesday, an official said the process is “still very much underway” to reconcile what exactly the post-conflict, two-state phase looks like once the fighting is over as the US discusses these ideas with other Arab capitals and Israel. The body of Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian will be buried in a shrine south of Tehran on Thursday, according to state media IRNA. A funeral ceremony will be held at the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs building in Tehran at 9 a.m. local time on Thursday morning. Later on Thursday, Amir-Abdollahian will be buried at the Shah Abdol-Azim Shrine in Rey, south of Tehran, according to IRNA. Israel’s far-right minister Bezalel Smotrich is asking Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to approve “harsh punitive measures” against the Palestinian Authority for seeking statehood unilaterally. The six steps laid out by Smotrich on X include seeking the approval of ten thousand housing units in settlements in the West Bank, the approval of a settlement for every country that recognizes Palestine as a state, and canceling permits for officials from the Palestinian Authority seeking to use crossings in the occupied West Bank. The measures, Smotrich said, are a response to the Palestinian Authority’s “pursuit of unilateral recognition as a nation and within the framework of bilateral agreements with a number of countries and the legal battle it is waging against the State of Israel, at the tribunals in the Hague in order to bring the war to a halt.” The controversial minister is also seeking to cancel Norway’s role as a facilitator and freeze the transfer of funds from the taxes collected by Israel from Palestinians and bound for the Palestinian Authority. Israel withdrew its ambassadors to Norway, Spain and Ireland following a decision Thursday by the three countries to recognize the Palestinian state. France has said now is not the “right time” for it to join its European Union neighbors, Ireland and Spain, in recognizing Palestinian statehood. The country’s Foreign Minister Stephane Séjourne stressed that his government’s “position is clear” that the recognition of Palestinian statehood is “not a taboo” for France. His remarks come after Ireland, Spain and Norway all announced their plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state on May 28. “This decision must be useful, in other words, it must enable a decisive advance to be made on the political front,” Séjourne said in a foreign ministry statement on Wednesday. The foreign minister stressed that such a decision is not merely a “symbolic issue or a question of political positioning” but rather a “diplomatic tool” in the service of the two-state solution in the Middle East. Ireland’s Prime Minister Simon Harris told a news conference earlier Wednesday that he was “confident” that “more countries will join us” in recognizing Palestinian statehood in the near future. On Tuesday, France broke away from its Western allies and expressed support for the International Criminal Court after the court announced its decision to seek arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister, as well as Hamas leaders. Hundreds of thousands of people turned out on the streets of Tehran on Wednesday to participate in the funeral procession and bid farewell to Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, both killed in a helicopter crash this week. Crowds of mourners were seen wearing black marching through the Iranian capital carrying Iranian flags, and holding photographs of the deceased President Raisi, Amir-Abdollahian and other officials who were killed in Sunday’s helicopter crash. On Tuesday, the bodies of the victims were transferred to the holy Shiite city of Qom, where many of the clerics who make up Iran’s theocratic elite are trained. Later on Tuesday evening, the bodies were returned to the capital to lie at Tehran’s Grand Mosallah (prayer hall). A truck was seen to be moving through the crowds with loudspeakers playing verses from the Quran through Tehran. Mourners told CNN they were very “shocked” and “sad” at the news of Raisi’s death and were seen waving flags with a black background which say Raisi was a “martyr of God.” The Israeli foreign minister has ordered the recall of the country’s ambassador to Spain following Madrid’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state. Israel Katz also summoned the ambassadors of Norway and Ireland for “reprimand talks,” during which they will watch stark video taken during Hamas’ October 7 attacks, the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement. “History will remember that Spain, Norway and Ireland decided to award a gold medal to the murderers and rapists of Hamas who raped teenage girls and burned babies,” Katz said. “Israel will not let it stand - their step will have serious consequences,” Katz added. Norway, Ireland and Spain’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state has been welcomed by Hamas, who has urged other countries to follow suit. “We call on countries around the world to recognize our legitimate national rights, support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence, and end the Zionist occupation of our land.” Earlier on Wednesday, Palestinian Authority also welcomed the decision of the three European nations to recognize a Palestinian state and similarly urged other countries to follow their lead. Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas has welcomed Ireland, Norway and Spain’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state, urging other countries to follow their lead. The president’s office said Madrid’s decision “reflects Spain’s keenness to support the Palestinian people and their inalienable and legitimate rights to their land and homeland,” according to a statement cited by Palestinian news agency Wafa. Abbas said Norway and Ireland have “steadfastly supported the rights of the Palestinian people over the past years and voted in favor of these rights in international forums.” The presidency called for other countries to “follow the example of Norway, Ireland and Spain, which chose the path of supporting the achievement of peace and stability and consolidating the rules of international legitimacy, and international law.” Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said Wednesday that the “world community now needs progress” in the process of seeking peace in Gaza. Norway, Spain and Ireland have announced plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Israel responded to the announcement by ordering the immediate recall of its ambassadors to Ireland and Norway. When asked by a reporter whether the Norwegian government risks side-tracking the peace process, Eide said: “We want to maintain both close diplomatic and other relations (with Israel). There are many links between Norway and Israel, and what they do is up to them,” he said. The prime ministers of Ireland, Spain and Norway have hailed their decision to recognize a Palestinian state as an “important step” toward “peace” in the region. All three stressed the role of Palestinian statehood in enforcing the two-state solution in the Middle East. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told the Spanish parliament that Spain had chosen to “recognize the state of Palestine for peace, coherence and justice.” Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris called the move an “important step” toward “permanent peace,” speaking to journalists in Dublin. Harris acknowledged that although there will be “reaction” and “interpretations” of the decision’s implications, it was important to “not lose sight” that children in Gaza and Israel both “deserve peace.” Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told reporters in Oslo that “there can be no peace in the Middle East unless Palestinians and Israelis have their own state, and that there is a two-state solution.” Foreign Minister Israel Katz has said he is ordering the immediate recall of Israel’s ambassadors to Ireland and Norway following those countries’ decision to recognize a Palestinian state. Spain was also among the three countries that announced plans Wednesday to formally recognize a Palestinian state starting May 28. Spain, Norway and Ireland have announced plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state, in a move that is likely to bolster the global Palestinian cause but strain relations with Israel. The recognition will come into force in all three countries on May 28, Irish foreign minister Micheál Martin said. Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said the war in Gaza has “made it clear that achieving peace and stability must be predicted on resolving the Palestinian question.” Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said: “We will recognize the state of Palestine for peace, coherence and justice.” Read the full story. Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh attended funeral ceremonies for Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Tehran on Wednesday. “We have come from Gaza to pay our condolences to the Islamic Republic of Iran,”  Haniyeh told crowds. Haniyeh lives in Qatar. Iran-backed militant groups Hamas, the Houthis, and Hezbollah have sent condolences to Tehran over Raisi’s death. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers in Iran’s capital Tehran on Wednesday in funeral ceremonies for the late President Ebrahim Raisi and others killed in a helicopter crash. The funeral, broadcast on Iranian state TV, saw large crowds gathered to pay final respects to the late president. The death of ultraconservative Raisi and other high-ranking officials comes at a delicate time for a country that faces unprecedented challenges at home and from abroad. Nine people died in the helicopter crash on Sunday, including Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Imam Mohammad Ali Alehashem, Governor Malek Rahmati, along with two pilots, a chief crew and two security staff. Authorities are investigating what caused the crash on a remote mountainside in foggy weather. Raisi’s death has raised questions about who will eventually succeed Iran’s 85-year-old Supreme Leader Khamenei, the most powerful man in the country ruled under a strict theocracy. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blasted the charges from the International Criminal Court brought against him and his defense minister as “beyond outrageous” in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. Last week, Israel’s defense chief Yoav Gallant called on Netanyahu to publicly rule out Israeli governance over Gaza, warning that he opposes Israeli rule in the Palestinian enclave. When asked by Tapper if he would rule out the Israeli occupation of Gaza, Netanyahu said that “resettling” the Palestinian territory was out of the question. He also said he is “not concerned” about traveling abroad after the arrest warrant. Watch Tapper ask Netanyahu if Israel could have done anything to prevent innocent deaths: Here are the latest developments in the region: The chief of staff for the late Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has revealed new details about the hours after the presidential helicopter went missing. Gholam Hossein Esmaili was in one of three helicopters returning from a dam inauguration ceremony on Iran’s border with Azerbaijan, he said in an interview with IRINN state TV, and reported by Iran’s semi-official news agency Mehr News on Tuesday. The helicopter carrying nine people ran into inclement weather on the way back and went missing, prompting an hours-long overnight search in the mountainous region. On the return flight on Sunday, three helicopters took off at around 1 p.m. local time Sunday “while weather conditions in the area were normal,” Esmaili said, as cited by Mehr News. He said the weather conditions in the mountainous region in Varzeghan — where the crash happened — were perfect at the start of the flight. Roughly 30 seconds into flying above the clouds, Esmaili said his pilot noticed the helicopter in the middle had disappeared. The pilot circled around to search for the president’s helicopter, he said. Esmaili said several attempts were made to contact the president’s helicopter through radio devices before their helicopter continued its flight and landed at a nearby copper mine. Esmail said the pilot of the helicopter he was flying in was unable to decrease altitude because of the clouds. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian and the head of the president’s protection unit, who were in the same chopper as Raisi, did not respond to repeated calls after the helicopter went missing, Esmaili said. One person alive for three hours: Tabriz’s Friday prayer Imam, Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Alehashem, was able to answer the pilot’s phone and said the helicopter had crashed into a valley and he was in critical condition, Esmaili added. Esmaili said after they found the location of the crashed helicopter, it was clear from the condition of the bodies of Raisi, Abdollahian and others that they “had died instantly.” Alehashem was alive for at least three hours after the crash and was able to speak to officials multiple times before he died, Esmaili said. Israeli officials presented their latest thinking about a potential Rafah incursion during a meeting with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, in which the US side asked a lot of “hard questions,” according to a senior administration official. The official noted that the two sides will continue those discussions, but that Israelis have been incorporating US feedback and concerns as they continue to work through those plans and that both sides share the joint goal of destroying Hamas. As part of the US discussions with the Israelis, US officials also made a series of “specific requests” with regard to humanitarian aid that they have agreed to implement, according to the official. One of these requests included helping facilitate aid distribution by getting the Israelis to agree to allow aid scanned in Cyprus to be sent directly to the Israeli port of Ashdod, bypassing Egypt. Just today, over 370 pallets of aid were distributed in Gaza, according to the official. Following the discussion, it’s also clear the process is “still very much underway” to reconcile what exactly the post-conflict, two-state phase looks like once the fighting is over as the US discusses these ideas with other Arab capitals and Israel, the official said. In reference to the US-Saudi deal, the official said that they’re getting to the point where the “full package is very clear” but that the ongoing conflict in Gaza needs to recede to “open up space for this.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied allegations that he was starving Palestinians in Gaza as a method of war, saying an arrest warrant application under review in the International Criminal Court (ICC) is based on a “pack of lies.” The accusations against Netanyahu include “causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,” according to ICC prosecutor Karim Khan. With hostages still believed to be held in Gaza, pressure has been growing for a deal that would see hostages released in exchange for a ceasefire. But when asked about public polling showing that a majority of Israelis believe freeing hostages is a higher priority than military action, Netanyahu said you could not have one without the other. Netanyahu is deeply unpopular in Israel, where he is also facing an ongoing corruption trial. Critics have accused the prime minister of being beholden to members of his far-right coalition and prolonging the war to maintain his grip on power. Speaking to Tapper, Netanyahu likened himself to US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, claiming the arrest warrants were like putting Nazi leader Adolf Hitler on the docks alongside the American wartime president who oversaw the US’s mobilization during World War II. Read the full story. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has a “very clear plan” for the future in Gaza following the war there. He told CNN’s Jake Tapper Tuesday that Israel’s first goal is to eliminate Hamas, before implementing “sustained demilitarization of Gaza” and finally reconstructing Gaza. Resettling Gaza, however, was “never in the cards,” Netanyahu said. Read the full story. None of the aid that has been unloaded from the temporary floating pier the US constructed off the coast of Gaza has been delivered to the broader Palestinian population, as the US works with the United Nations and Israel to identify safe delivery routes inside the enclave, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. Several desperate Gazans intercepted trucks delivering aid from the pier over the weekend, leading the UN to suspend the delivery operations until the logistical challenges are resolved. CNN reported the group did not trust that the aid was actually meant for the Palestinian people. “I have doubts,” Mounir Ayad, a Gaza resident, told CNN near the pier. The US is working with Israel and the United Nations to establish “alternative routes” for the safe delivery of the 569 tons of aid transported to Gaza since last week, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said on Tuesday. Asked if any of the 569 tons of aid has been delivered to the people of Gaza, Ryder said “as of today, I do not believe so.” He added that aid had been held in an assembly area on shore, but as of Tuesday had begun getting moved to warehouses for distribution throughout Gaza as alternative routes have been established. A US official told CNN that the Defense Department and UN are still working to determine the capacity of the staging area in Gaza and how much aid can be held there at any given time. The amount of aid getting to the Gaza shoreline from its initial staging area in Cyprus has also fallen short of initial Pentagon estimates. The last humanitarian airdrop announced by US Central Command was conducted on May 9. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blasted the charges brought by the International Criminal Court against him and his defense minister as “beyond outrageous” in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. The Israeli leader’s comments come after the chief prosecutor of the ICC on Monday announced that he was seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and senior Hamas leaders over alleged war crimes. Netanyahu described Khan as a “rogue prosecutor that has put false charges, that are both dangerous and false.” By applying for the arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders in the same action, Khan received a ferocious reaction from Israel and sharp criticism from the US, a close ally. Rights groups have hailed the decision, however. A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan’s application for the arrest warrants. Neither Israel nor the United States are members of the ICC.

Egyptian intelligence quietly changed the terms of a ceasefire proposal that Israel had already signed off on earlier this month, ultimately scuttling a deal that could have released Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and set a pathway to temporarily end the fighting in Gaza, according to three people familiar with the discussions. The ceasefire agreement that Hamas ended up announcing on May 6 was not what the Qataris or the Americans believed had been submitted to Hamas for a potential final review, the sources said. The changes made by Egyptian intelligence, the details of which have not been previously reported, led to a wave of anger and recrimination among officials from the US, Qatar and Israel, and left ceasefire talks at an impasse. CIA Director Bill Burns, who has spearheaded the US efforts to broker a ceasefire agreement, was in the region when word reached him that the Egyptians had changed the terms of the deal. He was angry and embarrassed, the same person said, believing it made him look like he wasn’t in the loop or hadn’t informed the Israelis of the changes.

cnn,Is India’s free press not so free after a decade of Modi?,"May 22, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/media/india-elections-press-freedom-decline-intl-hnk/index.html,"These days, journalist Siddique Kappan avoids controversial stories. Last time he chased a major story, a shocking rape-and-murder case, it landed the father of three in jail for more than two years, and severely damaged his career and livelihood. The 44-year-old blames his incarceration on a worsening climate for journalists in India, where arrests and harassment are growing more common. And he is far from the only journalist feeling squeezed out of their industry during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decade-long rule. The government of the popular but divisive leader - who has not taken a single solo press conference while in office - stands accused by opponents of suppressing media pluralism and ratcheting up the use of anti-terror legislation against reporters. And as Modi looks to win another five years in power in an ongoing nationwide election, critics fear further erosion of the protections afforded to India’s free press. “I think many times before I write stories,” Kappan told CNN. “Anytime, anywhere, anyone can file a case against me.” In October 2020, Kappan was working as a freelancer for a Malayalam-language news website. He was on his way to Hathras district, in northern Uttar Pradesh state, to report on the alleged gang rape and killing of a Dalit teenager by upper-caste men. India’s caste system was officially abolished decades ago, but the social hierarchy imposed on people by birth still exists in many aspects of life. Dalits are on the lowest rung. Before he arrived at the scene, he was taken into police custody, charged under anti-terror and money laundering laws. The police alleged he was part of a conspiracy to disturb the peace in the area, but he said his arrest was an attempt to tamp down on coverage of the story. He would spend 28 months in jail. Kappan was granted bail by the Supreme Court in February 2023, but while he currently walks free, his case is still making its way through the courts. Opposing his bail, the Uttar Pradesh government, led by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court. In the document, seen by CNN, it argued against bail on the grounds Kappan had been “writing articles targeted at spreading communal tensions” and was a part of a larger conspiracy to “foment religious discord and spread terror in the country.” CNN has contacted the BJP at both the local and national level for comment on the case. Since his bail, Kappan has struggled to find a permanent job to provide for his family. “The main reason is the fear of newspaper bosses, the media, which depends on government advertisement, who do not want to upset the government,” he told CNN. He says he is wary of more cases being brought against him, and finds himself working on “safe zone” stories unlikely to ruffle feathers. The treatment of journalists like Kappan has struck fear into many other reporters. “There was nothing Kappan could have done differently to avoid arrest, except not going to report,” said Kaushik Raj, who works with several publications and writes on hate crimes. “This was chilling for me.” India is one of the largest media markets in the world, according to the Paris-based group Reporters Without Borders (RSF), with more than 20,000 daily newspapers across the country and about 450 privately owned channels dedicated to news, which broadcast in dozens of languages. Yet despite its size and diversity, critics say the media industry is growing increasingly subservient to Modi’s government. “There was a blend of public service, public interest and corporate private media that served a burgeoning urban middle class, but also showed interest in issues of rural development. Journalists were respected… Regulatory mechanisms were weak but not completely absent,” said Shakuntala Banaji, professor of media, culture and social change at the London School of Economics. “They have been all but destroyed in the last 10 years,” she added. According to RSF, the country fell 25 places on the Press Freedom Index between 2015 and 2023, to 161st place – below neighboring Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. In the latest index for this year it rose slightly to 159th place but remains below all neighbors except Bangladesh (165th). “There has been a sharp deterioration in the status of media over the last ten years,” Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) India representative Kunal Majumder told CNN, adding that this included imprisonment and invoking terror laws to criminalize journalists. According to the CPJ, 21 journalists were imprisoned in India between 2014 and 2023, up from four between 2004 and 2013. There has also been an uptick, it said, in the use of anti-terror laws – which allow for detention without trial or charge for up to 180 days – against reporters. Police have used the same anti-terror law against a website linked to a left-leaning organisation critical of the government. In a charge sheet filed to the court recently and seen by CNN, police claimed NewsClick was responsible for stoking riots that hit New Delhi in 2020, spreading disinformation around Covid, and funding terror groups. In a statement, NewsClick said the claims were absurd and baseless, and were intended to “target independent journalism.” Its editor Prabir Purkayastha was in jail from October 3 until Wednesday, when the Supreme Court granted him bail, saying his arrest and remand were “invalid in the eyes of law.” “When the state resorts to using anti-terror laws to shut down the freedom of expression of journalists holding institutions to account, then we are deep in authoritarian rule,” said Banaji from LSE. Asked about this apparent increase in hostility to journalists, Kanchan Gupta, senior advisor to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, told CNN that media workers were not above the law. “If journalists violate the law they are open to prosecution and legal action,” he said. Alleged harassment of reporters has worsened too, according to press freedom groups. The Amnesty 2022 release says Hindu nationalists feel emboldened to threaten and abuse journalists critical of the government. Ravish Kumar, one of the country’s best-known journalists, said he has not felt safe for many years while people from various Hindu-nationalist organisations showered him with death threats and abuse. The face of New Delhi Television (NDTV) for more than two decades, Kumar said he chose to resign when he was told he would have to toe the government line. He said he was driven to this decision during a hostile takeover of the channel by billionaire Gautam Adani in late 2022. CNN has contacted NDTV for comment. Kumar told CNN he resigned because Adani’s proximity to Modi and the BJP would leave him unable to continue asking tough questions of the government. Soon after, he started his own YouTube channel with a small team that has about 10 million subscribers. He said he took to YouTube – where his videos receive at least a million views within their first 24 hours - because there was no other option left. “There is no place for people like us in Indian media anymore,” he said. Critics say TV news has been overrun by pro-government voices. With the world’s largest election underway, a study of prime-time shows by media watchdog Newslaundry - that tracked more than 400 segments between February 1 and April 12 - showed that 52% of airtime was spent criticizing the opposition, while another 27% pushed pro-Modi narratives. For Kumar the pluralism of India’s past is fast disappearing. “There is very little time and space left, so we’re living our last moments,” he said. But Gupta, of the information ministry, said it was “not true” that the media toes a government line. “There are 903 satellite channels in the country,” he said. “If you look at the headlines across newspapers and television channels you will see that this generalization is not true.” “This entire thing of saying that the media houses or individual journalists are manipulated by the government, that is not true.” It is not just local reporters who face obstacles. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s South Asia bureau chief Avani Dias recently left the country, as did Vanessa Dougnac, regional correspondent for four French publications. Dias said the government told her that her visa extension would be denied as her reporting had “crossed a line,” though the government has denied this. It said she was granted an extension the day she paid her visa fees, on 18 April, but decided to leave nonetheless on 20 April. Dougnac, an overseas citizen of India (OCI) who worked in the country for 23 years, left in February. In January, she said, she received a notice from the Ministry of Home Affairs stating that her journalistic activities were “malicious” and “critical in a manner that they create a biased negative perception about India.” She applied for her journalistic permit – as required for OCIs since 2022 – but was denied. “They gave no reasons nor any justifications for why they denied my permit,” she told CNN from Paris. India’s Home Ministry did not respond to CNN’s request for comment about Dougnac’s situation. And in February last year the Indian offices of the BBC were raided by tax authorities, weeks after the broadcaster aired a documentary highly critical of Modi. The documentary, which was described as “anti-India garbage” by a senior advisor to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, was later blocked on social media platforms. Speaking to reporters shortly after the BBC raids, BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia made no reference to the documentary, and said companies, including media agencies, must “follow and respect Indian law.” The BBC has since split its India operations into separate companies in a bid to meet the country’s foreign investment rules. Dougnac said she was not surprised by the actions against international media. “It started with local journalists and slowly foreign correspondents got the sense they were next,” she said. “That is what is happening now.” Despite witnessing what is happening to and around him, Kappan says he has not lost faith in journalism in india. He considers advocating for it a “moral imperative.” “Despite the personal risks involved, the pursuit of truth remains paramount,” he said.",day journalist siddique kappan avoids controversial story

cnn,Bollywood and billionaires: India’s rich and famous cast their vote in the world’s largest election,"May 21, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/21/india/india-bollywood-mumbai-vote-general-election-intl-hnk/index.html,"Celebrities, industrialists and politicians cast their vote in the world’s biggest democracy as polls opened in India’s financial capital during a weekslong nationwide election, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking another five-year term. Voting took place in six constituencies across Mumbai in the western state of Maharashtra, and 43 others nationwide, on Monday as millions flocked to polling booths to determine who will lead the world’s most populous country. Across India’s richest city and the birthplace of the Bollywood movie industry, a bevy of celebrities were photographed casting their ballot, showing off purple-streaked index fingers – a sign that determines one has voted in an Indian election. The “King of Bollywood” Shah Rukh Khan was seen leaving a Mumbai polling booth with his family – wife Gauri, daughter Suhana, and sons Aryan and Abram. Elsewhere, one of India’s most famous actors, Amitabh Bachchan, also cast his vote at a polling booth in the suburb of Andheri. “As responsible Indian citizens we must exercise our right to vote this Monday in Maharashtra,” Khan wrote on X over the weekend. “Let’s carry out our duty as Indians and vote keeping our country’s best interests in mind. Go forth Promote, our right to Vote.” Film stars Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh, who are expecting their first child this year, were also pictured, as well as billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani with his wife, Nita and son Akash. After casting his vote on Monday, actor Akshay Kumar said he wanted to see India become “developed and strong.” Showing his ink-stained finger to local reporters, he added: “I voted… India should vote for what they deem is right…I think voter turnout will be good.” But in keeping with previous elections, voter turnout in Mahrashtra on Monday remained low at 54% — with 47-55% across Mumbai’s six constituencies — according to data from the Election Commission. By comparison, in the northeastern state of West Bengal, some 73% of eligible voters cast their ballot, data showed. The key election players in the city are Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main opposition Indian National Congress, and two rival factions of Shiv Sena — a local ultranationalist grouping that has long played a key role in Mumbai’s politics. Mumbai, a city of more than 12 million, is often likened to New York and referred to as the “city of dreams,” where millions of migrants from across the country arrive to make their fortune and find purpose. It’s a city of extreme wealth and extreme poverty, where skyscrapers tower over slum dwellings and poor children beg for money at the windows of chauffeur-driven cars carrying students to school. And while the rich and famous were seen casting their vote, many migrant workers in the city will be left out of the election. Under India’s election rules, eligible voters can only cast ballots in their constituencies – meaning those working outside of their state have to return home to vote. For many out-of-state workers, especially underprivileged daily-wage workers in the unorganized sector, that’s nearly impossible, due to the cost associated with traveling home. Many voters in Mumbai are concerned with growing inflation and are seeking better education and employment opportunities. “The change I want to see is, things should become less costly,” 34-year-old grocer Sachin Chaudhary, previously told CNN, adding he also wants to see better opportunities in the employment sector.",celebrity industrialist politician cast vote world biggest democracy poll opened india financial capital weekslong nationwide election prime minister narendra modi seeking another fiveyear term voting took place six constituency across mumbai western state maharashtra others nationwide monday million flocked polling booth determine lead world populous country across india richest city birthplace bollywood movie industry bevy celebrity photographed casting ballot showing purplestreaked index finger sign determines one voted indian election king bollywood shah rukh khan seen leaving mumbai polling booth family wife gauri daughter suhana son aryan abram elsewhere one india famous actor amitabh bachchan also cast vote polling booth suburb andheri responsible indian citizen must exercise right vote monday maharashtra khan wrote x weekend let carry duty indian vote keeping country best interest mind go forth promote right vote film star deepika padukone ranveer singh expecting first child year also pictured well billionaire industrialist mukesh ambani wife nita son akash casting vote monday actor akshay kumar said wanted see india become developed strong showing inkstained finger local reporter added voted india vote deem righti think voter turnout good keeping previous election voter turnout mahrashtra monday remained low across mumbai six constituency according data election commission comparison northeastern state west bengal eligible voter cast ballot data showed key election player city modis ruling bharatiya janata party bjp main opposition indian national congress two rival faction shiv sena local ultranationalist grouping long played key role mumbai politics mumbai city million often likened new york referred city dream million migrant across country arrive make fortune find purpose city extreme wealth extreme poverty skyscraper tower slum dwelling poor child beg money window chauffeurdriven car carrying student school rich famous seen casting vote many migrant worker city left election india election rule eligible voter cast ballot constituency meaning working outside state return home vote many outofstate worker especially underprivileged dailywage worker unorganized sector thats nearly impossible due cost associated traveling home many voter mumbai concerned growing inflation seeking better education employment opportunity change want see thing become le costly yearold grocer sachin chaudhary previously told cnn adding also want see better opportunity employment sector,28.0,positive,0
cnn,"May 20, 2024 Israel-Hamas war","May 21, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-05-20-24/index.html,"Our live coverage of Israel’s war in Gaza has moved here. Nearly 570 metric tons of humanitarian aid has been delivered across the temporary pier to Gaza so far, according to the US Central Command. The aid will be distributed by humanitarian partners, CENTCOM said in a statement. The pier was anchored to a beach in Gaza last week to funnel aid from various countries into the enclave, with most border crossings closed and a catastrophic humanitarian disaster unfolding inside. France broke away from its Western allies and expressed support for the International Criminal Court (ICC) after the court announced its decision to seek arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar. Paris also said it has been warning “for many months” the need for strict compliance with international humanitarian laws and “in particular of the unacceptable level of civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip and the lack of humanitarian access,” the statement said. The statement marks a major split between France’s position and that of its Western allies, notably the United States, where President Joe Biden called the decision “outrageous.” France has been one of the few Western countries willing to take a tougher stance on Israel, including criticizing America’s decision to veto ceasefire resolutions in the UN Security Council early on and calling for an immediate ceasefire. US President Joe Biden on Monday rejected the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant requests for Israeli leaders amid the ongoing war against Hamas. The ICC’s request targets top Israeli officials and Hamas leaders. The ICC’s prosecutor Karim Khan rejected accusations by Israel and some of its allies questioning its independence, saying the request “is not a witch hunt, this is not some kind of emotional reaction to noise. It’s a forensic process.” Here are some reactions to the arrest request: Here are more headlines from the region: US President Joe Biden offered a full-throated rejection of the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant requests for Israeli leaders amid the ongoing war against Hamas. Biden also acknowledged “the trauma” of October 7 and reiterated his “ironclad” commitment to Israel’s safety and security. And he promised not to rest until the hostages being held by Hamas are released. The president also pledged his commitment to a two-state solution. Biden and his top officials have said the creation of a Palestinian state with guarantees for Israel’s security is the only way to bring peace and stability to the Middle East. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said it’s “unacceptable” that the International Criminal Court moved to seek arrest warrants for Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and senior Hamas officials on the charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the war in Gaza. At least 12 Palestinians were killed Monday in an Israeli military bombardment of Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip, according to local health officials. The strikes also injured 10 people, a spokesperson at the local Kamal Adwan Hospital told CNN. Residents and rescue workers say about 10 other people were trapped under the rubble of buildings that were flattened in the attack. CNN video of the aftermath shows the concrete skeleton of destroyed buildings, with entire walls ripped through on several floors. Stone slabs and metal rods spill from the roof of the building as Palestinian men, women and children crowd near the site. Some hold their heads in their hands, while others search the debris for survivors. Ambulances from the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) could be seen slowly moving along demolished roads, in footage filmed for CNN. Rescue workers and citizens dug through smashed pieces of broken concrete. In one scene, emergency crews resorted to using a rope to pull up the body of a woman wrapped in a blanket. Israel’s military campaign in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has drained critical supplies and destroyed main highways. Fares Afana, the ambulance and emergency director for northern Gaza told CNN that emergency operations are “very difficult due to dwindling equipment.” One man who spoke to CNN from the scene said there were children trapped under the destroyed home of the Kahlout family. In recent days, the Israeli military has intensified attacks on several locations saying its soldiers “eliminated more than 200 terrorists, destroyed terrorist infrastructure and destroyed underground tunnels both from the ground and from the air” in northern Gaza. Author Salman Rushdie believes that Hamas would take charge of a Palestinian state if one was to be formed now. “Is that what the progressive movements of the Western left want to create?” Rushdie said in an interview regarding the recent students protests in the US. Rushdie said that “any normal person” would be shocked by the number of “innocent deaths” in Gaza, but he argued that pro-Palestinian demonstrators are failing to call out Hamas’ actions. “I think the demonstrators could also mention Hamas. Because it all started with them. And Hamas is a terrorist organization. And it’s strange that a young progressive student organization supports a fascist terrorist group, because they do that in a way,” he said. The author, who has been targeted for his writing multiple times, also says that calls for a free Palestine become “problematic… when it descends into anti-Semitism and sometimes even support for Hamas.” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says “the ICC has succeeded only in discrediting itself” by seeking an arrest warrant for Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu. “Since the immediate aftermath of October 7, Israel and allies and Jewish people around the world have faced pernicious efforts to equate a sovereign nation’s self-defense with barbaric acts of terrorism,” he said in Monday’s floor remarks. “But today, the most noxious attempt at moral equivalence comes from unelected international bureaucrats brandishing a contrived and perverted authority.” “In the same breath, the self-aggrandizing prosecutor of the International Criminal Court applied for arrest warrants for both Hamas chief terrorists and Israel’s duly elected prime minister. It’s a damning development, but not for the supposed subjects of the applications. McConnell also addressed the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash over the weekend. “The untimely death of the president of Iran does not change the underlying threats this regime poses to its own citizens the region and to the free world,” he said. “I’d also like to extend my condolences to Iran’s neighbors who still live under the constant threat of a regime that practices what it preaches. Death to Israel, death to America, war on international commerce, and chaos across the Middle East. Meanwhile, other senior GOP senators running for leader also condemned the ICC’s move regarding an arrest warrant for Netanyahu. Senate Minority Whip John Thune, who is running to replace McConnell as GOP leader next Congress, tweeted that the move was “as unjustifiable as it is shameful.” Sen. John Cornyn, who is also running, condemned the ICC’s decision in his own post on X, calling it “illegitimate and unsubstantiated.” White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Monday wrapped up his visit to the Middle East, during which he met with Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid and members of the war cabinet, including Yoav Gallant and Benny Gantz. During his meetings, he brought up the need to increase the surge of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip as well as the situation in the enclave more broadly. Asked later if any specific progress was made during the trip on a hostage deal, Kirby said that they continue to work on it but that there were no substantive updates. House Speaker Mike Johnson confirmed House Republican leaders are looking at sanctions in response to the International Criminal Court’s decision to move ahead with arrest warrants including for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Johnson added: “The ICC has no authority over Israel or the United States, and today’s baseless and illegitimate decision should face global condemnation. International bureaucrats cannot be allowed to use lawfare to usurp the authority of democratic nations that maintain the rule of law.” Some background: The warrants against the Israeli politicians, including Netanyahu, mark the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. Israel and the US are not members of the ICC. However, the ICC claims to have jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court’s founding principles in 2015. The United States believes the ICC applications for arrest warrants against senior Israeli officials are “fully unfounded” and “should not have been brought,” according to a State Department spokesperson, while Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the US would still cooperate with the ICC on their work on Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Austin said US support for Israel remains “ironclad.” State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said that the ICC has done “important work over the years to hold people accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity” that the US still supports. Miller would not say whether the US is considering taking action against the ICC as a result of the arrest warrants. “We’ll have the time to look at it, to digest it and perhaps issue a more complete response,” said State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller about the ICC applications at a press conference. Asked whether there was an inconsistency in its position toward the war Russia is waging in Ukraine and Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, National Security Council spokesman spokesman John Kirby said the difference is one of intent. Kirby argued civilian casualties in Gaza, by contrast, have been lamentable but inadvertent. “IDF soldiers are not waking up in the morning, putting their boots on the ground with direct orders to go kill innocent civilians in Gaza,” Kirby said, while acknowledging that any civilian death toll is too high. More than 900,000 people, approximately 40% of Gaza’s population, have been displaced in the past two weeks as Israeli bombardment continues across much of the enclave, United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Monday. The Israeli bombardment has been accompanied by ground incursions and intense fighting, particularly in eastern Rafah and Jabalya, he added, saying that of the displaced Palestinians, 812,000 are from Rafah and over 100,000 from northern Gaza. He added that the large-scale displacement has resulted in dire living conditions due to a severe shortage of shelters, with no tents and very few shelter items available for distribution. Displaced individuals are seeking refuge in open spaces, damaged buildings, and agricultural lands in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah. House Republican leaders are looking at putting an International Criminal Court (ICC) sanctions bill on the floor, according to a congressional aide, in response to the ICC’s decision to move ahead with arrest warrants, including for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Specifically, there is talk among top Republicans of modifying an existing bill, sponsored by GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, that would impose sanctions on the ICC if it arrests, investigates, or prosecutes any protected person of the United States or its allies. But nothing has been finalized yet, and it’s unclear if they will be able to prepare legislation in time for a floor vote this week. The House is only scheduled to be in session for three days this week, and then it will break for the weeklong Memorial Day recess. US National Security spokesman John Kirby said the Biden administration plans to stay in close touch with members of Congress but stopped short of committing support for any Republican effort to levy new sanctions on the ICC. Iran’s presidential elections will take place Friday, June 28, following the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash. According to Iranian state news IRNA, candidates can register from May 30 to June 3, and campaigning will run from June 12 until the morning of June 27. What happened? Raisi died in a helicopter crash together with his Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian on Sunday in the East Azerbaijan Province, northwest of Iran. Read more here: Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vehemently rejected a move by the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor on Monday to seek a warrant for his arrest over alleged war crimes in Gaza. Calling the escalation of the legal proceedings “a complete distortion of reality,” Netanyahu said the “absurd and false warrants” of the ICC prosecutor, which also called for the arrest of Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, were not only targeting them, but “directed against the entire State of Israel.” “This is exactly what the new antisemitism looks like, it has moved from the campuses in the West to the court in The Hague,” he added. In a video statement in English, he called it a “travesty of justice” and an “outrageous decision” that “creates a twisted and false moral equivalence between the leaders of Israel and the henchmen of Hamas.” “The prosecutor’s absurd charges against me and Israel’s defense minister are merely an attempt to deny Israel the basic right of self-defense. And I assure you of one thing: This attempt will utterly fail,” he said. He added that “Israel will continue to wage this war in full compliance with international law.” A close ally: The warrants against the Israeli politicians, including Netanyahu, mark the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. US officials have previously said that they “firmly oppose” the ICC investigation into the Israel-Palestinian conflict. On Monday, US President Joe Biden strongly denounced the decision while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US has long opposed the ICC’s investigation into the war in Gaza because it believes the court “has no jurisdiction over this matter.” Video of Netanyahu’s response here: ICC prosecutor Karim Khan has rejected accusations by Israel and some of its allies questioning its independence. Speaking to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview, Khan said the “allegations of anti-semitism, the hate, the idea that by applying the law blindly, we are favoring one side, or persecuting or being hostile to another side …. nothing can be further from the truth.” The International Criminal Court has responded to criticism by the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, telling CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that the ICC prosecutor has spent “three years” trying to improve dialogue with Israel and obtain information relevant to our investigations.” Blinken criticized the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan for rushing to apply for the warrants and  “not allowing the Israeli legal system a full and timely opportunity to proceed.” “The prosecutor also repeatedly underlined his concerns regarding the adherence of Israel to international humanitarian law and has emphasized publicly that he has not seen any discernible change in conduct despite his earlier statements.” The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US has long opposed the ICC’s investigation into the war in Gaza because it believes the court “has no jurisdiction over this matter.” Explaining the Biden administration’s position, Blinken said the ICC was “established by its state parties as a court of limited jurisdiction.” “Those limits are rooted in principles of complementarity, which do not appear to have been applied here amid the prosecutor’s rush to seek these arrest warrants rather than allowing the Israeli legal system a full and timely opportunity to proceed,” he said, adding that the ICC prosecutor deviated from the usual legal process by applying for the arrest warrants. “In other situations, the prosecutor deferred to national investigations and worked with states to allow them time to investigate. The prosecutor did not afford the same opportunity to Israel, which has ongoing investigations into allegations against its personnel,” Blinken said. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US “fundamentally rejects” today’s announcement by the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan that he is applying for arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials “together with” Hamas leaders, saying that it “could jeopardize” ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas. “Fundamentally, this decision does nothing to help, and could jeopardize, ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement that would get hostages out and surge humanitarian assistance in, which are the goals the United States continues to pursue relentlessly,” Blinken added. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US has concerns over what he called “troubling process questions” leading up to the ICC prosecutor’s application for arrest warrants against top Israeli leaders. He said that the court’s prosecutor Karim Khan was scheduled to visit Israel “as early as next week” to discuss the investigation and hear from the Israeli government and that Khan’s staff was meant to travel to Israel on Monday to coordinate the trip. “These and other circumstances call into question the legitimacy and credibility of this investigation,” Blinken said, adding that the US also believed the “ICC has no jurisdiction over this matter.” US President Joe Biden has strongly denounced the decision by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to seek arrest warrants against Israeli leaders, calling it “outrageous.” “Let me be clear: whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas,” the president wrote. “We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.” The United Kingdom has criticized the decision by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor to seek arrest warrants for Hamas and Israeli leaders on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, implying the step could hamper the situation on the ground in Gaza. A spokesperson for the British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement: Later, another UK government spokesperson reiterated the UK’s opposition to the ICC’s action. “As we have said from the outset, we do not think the ICC has jurisdiction in this case. The UK has not yet recognised Palestine as a state, and Israel is not a State Party to the Rome Statute,” the spokesperson said. Some context: The UK is among the 124 countries that have signed up to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC. While it’s true that Israel is not a signatory (neither is the United States), the ICC claims to have jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court’s founding principles in 2015. A group of international legal experts issued a report on Monday, saying they that they believe the court has jurisdiction over the crimes set out in Khan’s application. The Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Wednesday praised the decision by the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan to apply for arrest warrants for several top leaders of Hamas and Israel, saying it illustrated the court’s “crucial role.” “This principled first step by the prosecutor opens the door to those responsible for the atrocities committed in recent months to answer for their actions at a fair trial.” Jarrah said in the statement that Khan made the decision to apply for the arrest warrants “in the face of pressure from US lawmakers and others” and added that the “hostile pressure is likely to increase while the ICC judges consider Khan’s request.” She gave no further details on these allegations. A group of international legal experts including human rights barrister Amal Clooney and the former president of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Judge Theodor Meron, has issued a report in support of the decision by the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan to apply for arrest warrants against the top leaders of Hamas and Israel. The panel was convened by Khan to review the evidence and legal analysis underpinning his application. They said there were “reasonable grounds to believe” that individuals named in the arrest warrants have committed war crimes or crimes against humanity. Khan is seeking arrest warrants against Hamas’ leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, who is the leader of the Al Qassem Brigades and is better known as Mohammed Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ political leader — over the October 7 attacks into southern Israel. Khan is also seeking warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over Israel’s military assault in Gaza. Clooney and Meron were joined by several other renowned legal experts: Lord Justice Fulford who is a former ICC judge; Baroness Helena Kennedy, the director of the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute; and human rights and international law experts Danny Friedman and Elizabeth Wilmshurst. They said: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the decision by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to raise warrants for his arrest over Israel’s military offensive in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks as “political outrage.” Speaking Monday at a meeting of the parliamentary group of his Likud party, Netanyahu claimed the application by ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan “will not deter us.” “We will continue in the war until the hostages are released and Hamas is destroyed,” added the Israeli leader. Charges against Netanyahu: The charges against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant include “causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,” Khan told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is applying for arrest warrants against Hamas leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The news on Monday came as Israeli forces intensified attacks across the Gaza Strip following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks, where seven months of bombardment has rendered entire Palestinian neighborhoods rubble-filled wasteland. Here’s what you need to know: Hamas has denounced the request by the International Criminal Court for arrest warrants of three of its leadership over the October 7 attacks into southern Israel. In a statement Monday, Hamas said it “strongly condemns the attempts of the ICC Prosecutor to equate victims with aggressors by issuing arrest warrants against a number of Palestinian resistance leaders without legal basis.” The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, issued requests for arrest warrants for Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’ military leader in Gaza, as well as two other top Hamas figures — Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, the leader of the Al Qassem Brigades and better known as Mohammed Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ political leader. Hamas said that arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over Israel’s military campaign in Gaza had come “seven months late,” during which time “the Israeli occupation committed thousands of crimes against Palestinian civilians, including children, women, doctors, journalists, and the destruction of private and public properties, mosques, churches, and hospitals.” The prosecutor should have issued arrest warrants against “all responsible leaders of the occupation who gave orders, and soldiers who participated in committing crimes,” according to the court’s statutes, the militant group added. “Hamas calls on the ICC Prosecutor to issue arrest warrants against all war criminals among the occupation leaders, officers, and soldiers who participated in crimes against the Palestinian people, and demands the cancellation of all arrest warrants issued against Palestinian resistance leaders.” House GOP leaders are still weighing a potential legislative response to the news that the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, per a GOP source familiar. House Speaker Mike Johnson is expected to put out a statement Monday, another source said, while leadership is still looking at potential legislative options. Nothing has been decided and discussions are still ongoing, but Republicans are expected to forcefully respond — and several of them have already spoken out. The House returns to Washington on Tuesday. A close ally: The warrants against the Israeli politicians mark the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. US officials have previously said that they “firmly oppose” the ICC investigation into the Israel-Palestinian conflict. CNN has asked the White House and State Department for comment on the announcement. The State Department did not immediately respond. At least 15 bodies arrived in a hospital in northern Gaza following a nearby airstrike on Palestinians queuing for aid on Monday, according to a health official, as Israeli forces ramp up attacks in the area. Victims were in a line for water at the time of the strike, the director of Kamal Adwan hospital told CNN. Another 30 people were injured, Dr. Husam Abu Safiya said. Since Israeli forces began ground attacks in the Jabalya neighborhood on May 11, at least 180 bodies and 550 injured people had arrived at local hospitals, added Abu Safiya. Israeli forces surround hospital: The Israeli military had surrounded another northern Gaza hospital – Al-Awda – Abu Safiya told CNN. Only Kamal Adwan remained operational, although most of the staff had left the facility. “We are providing services with limited resources, insufficient medical supplies, and a shortage of healthcare staff,” he said. Highest daily death toll: Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed 106 Palestinians and injured another 176 people in the past 24 hours, according to the Ministry of Health there. The number is the highest daily death toll since mid-April. In total, Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed at least 35,562 Palestinians and wounded another 79,652 people since October 7, the ministry said. CNN cannot independently verify the figures. The International Criminal Court – which is seeking arrest warrants for senior Israeli and Hamas leaders on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza – brings cases against individuals for war crimes or crimes against humanity. Not the ICJ: The ICC announcement on Monday is separate from the case that is currently being heard by the the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over an accusation from South Africa that Israel was committing genocide in its military campaign in Gaza following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks. The ICJ hears cases brought by states accusing others of violating their United Nations treaty obligations. ICC jurisdiction: Located in The Hague, Netherlands, and created by a treaty called the Rome Statute first brought before the United Nations, the ICC operates independently. Most countries – 124 of them – are parties to the treaty, but there are notable exceptions, including Israel, the US and Russia. That means that if the court grants the application made by ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, and issues arrest warrants for the five men, any country that is a member would have to arrest them and extradite them to The Hague. Under the rules of the court, all signatories of the Rome Statute have the obligation to cooperate fully with its decisions. This would make it extremely difficult for Netanyahu and Gallant to travel internationally, including to many countries that are among Israel’s closest allies – including Germany and the United Kingdom. Israeli politicians across the political spectrum have condemned the decision of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to apply for arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over Israel’s military assault in Gaza. The leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, said the application by Karim Khan, “is a complete moral failure, we cannot accept the outrageous comparison between Netanyahu and Sinwar,” a reference to Hamas’ military leader. “We will not remain silent.” The right-wing minister for National Security, Itamar Ben Gvir, accused the ICC of antisemitism, saying, “The Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense must ignore the anti-Semitic prosecutor of the Anti-Semitic Court, and order the escalation of the attack against Hamas, until its absolute defeat.” Meanwhile, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said: “We have not seen such a show of hypocrisy and hatred of Jews as that of the Hague Tribunal since Nazi propaganda.” “These arrest warrants will be the last nail in the dismantling of this political and anti-Semitic court. The friends of Israel and the truly enlightened countries will not be able to allow its continued existence and functioning,” Smotrich added. CNN has reached out to the Prime Minister’s office and Defense Ministry. The UN’s food assistance agency has warned critical supplies in Gaza will dry up “in a matter of days,” as a planned Israeli ground assault into Rafah triggers mass displacement amid a deepening humanitarian catastrophe. The World Food Programme (WFP) says the “escalation of military activity” in the southern Gaza city has “displaced hundreds of thousands of people.” Increased fighting in the strip could “bring aid operations to a complete standstill, the WFP added on May 15. On May 6, Israeli forces began expanding aerial strikes into ground attacks on Rafah, from where more than 810,000 Palestinians have been displaced, according to the UN’s agency for Palestine refugees. Diminished aid: Increased fighting in Gaza has made more than 300,000 tons of food in warehouses “inaccessible”, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Friday. The agency also cited the Egyptian Red Crescent as saying that last Thursday, 1,574 out of about 2,050 trucks carrying food remain stuck in Al Arish on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing, which has now been closed for two weeks after the Israeli military took control. On Monday, the General Authority for Crossings and Borders in Gaza said the closure of Rafah was threatening the lives of more than 11,000 wounded people requiring evacuation for treatment abroad. A member of Israel’s war cabinet, Benny Gantz, has condemned the decision of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to apply for arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. “The State of Israel is waging one of the just wars fought in modern history following a reprehensible massacre perpetrated by terrorist Hamas on the 7th of October,” Benny Gantz said in a statement. “While Israel fights with one of the strictest moral codes in history, while complying with international law and boasting a robust independent judiciary – drawing parallels between the leaders of a democratic country determined to defend itself from despicable terror to leaders of a blood-thirsty terror organisation is a deep distortion of justice and blatant moral bankruptcy,” he added. “The prosecutor’s position to apply for arrest warrants is in itself a crime of historic proportion to be remembered for generation.” ICC charges: The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include “causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,” the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview on Monday. The UN’s food assistance agency has demanded “safe, sustained access” into the Gaza Strip from authorities in Israel. The World Food Programme (WFP) raised concerns over an “expected escalation in fighting” that will “jeopardize” access into northern Gaza on X, adding, “We need safe, sustained access into and across Gaza to prevent famine.” What does Israel say? At least 422 humanitarian aid trucks were inspected and transferred to Gaza via Ashdod port and the Erez crossing, and Kerem Shalom, according to COGAT, the Israeli agency that coordinates the delivery of aid to Gaza. The trucks were also passed via a new US-constructed pier off the Gaza coast. Of these only 17 truck loads were delivered through the pier. COGAT said that there were 44 coordination requests for the movement of aid Sunday, of which 33 had been approved. Ten out of 11 UN requests had been approved. Much of the aid approved for transfer is not being distributed as Israel’s offensive has caused widespread demolition inside the territory, with intense fighting in the north, center and south of Gaza. Two crossings: Only the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing and the “Western Erez” Crossing in northern Gaza are open, although Israel’s severe aid restrictions means barely enough relief is trickling into the enclave. At least 6,000 tonnes of aid entered through the northern crossings in May, added WFP. The Rafah crossing between southern Gaza and neighboring Egypt was closed after Israeli authorities seized the Palestinian side – ahead of a planned full-scale ground assault into the nominal city. US officials have repeatedly said that they “firmly oppose” the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into the Israel-Palestinian conflict. CNN has asked the White House and State Department for comment on the announcement Monday that the ICC is seeking war crimes warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. The State Department did not immediately respond. When an initial investigation was launched in March, the State Department said in a statement, “Israel is not a party to the ICC and has not consented to the Court’s jurisdiction, and we have serious concerns about the ICC’s attempts to exercise its jurisdiction over Israeli personnel. The Palestinians do not qualify as a sovereign state and therefore, are not qualified to obtain membership as a state in, participate as a state in, or delegate jurisdiction to the ICC.” State Department officials have reiterated that opposition in recent weeks. “We’ve been really clear about the ICC investigation. We do not support it. We don’t believe that they have the jurisdiction. And I’m just going to leave it there for now,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in April. State Department Spokesperson Matt Miller said he could not “make any predictions or any announcements” when asked if the Biden administration would sanctions on top ICC officials if they went ahead with Israel indictments. The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) told CNN that “nobody is above the law,” after seeking arrest warrants for senior Hamas and Israeli leaders on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Karim Khan is seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and two other top Hamas leaders — Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, the leader of the Al Qassem Brigades and better known as Mohammed Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ political leader — over the October 7 attacks into southern Israel. He is also seeking warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over Israel’s military assault in Gaza. Previous dissent from Israel: When reports surfaced last month that the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court (ICC) was considering this course of action, Netanyahu said that any ICC arrest warrants against senior Israeli government and military officials “would be an outrage of historic proportions,” and that Israel “has an independent legal system that rigorously investigates all violations of the law.” Israel and the United States are not members of the ICC. However, the ICC claims to have jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court’s founding principles in 2015. The International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza, the court’s prosecutor Karim Khan told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview on Monday. The warrants against the Israeli politicians mark the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. The decision puts Netanyahu in the company of the Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom the ICC issued an arrest warrant over Moscow’s war on Ukraine. A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan’s application for the arrest warrants. Khan said the charges against Sinwar, Haniyeh and al-Masri include “extermination, murder, taking of hostages, rape and sexual assault in detention.” “The world was shocked on the 7th of October when people were ripped from their bedrooms, from their homes, from the different kibbutzim in Israel,” Khan told Amanpour, adding that “people have suffered enormously.” The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include “causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,” Khan told Amanpour. Two senior Hamas operatives in charge of liaising and directing Hamas fighters have been killed by air strikes in Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces said Monday. The two killed were Zaher Huli and Rami Khalil Faki, both from Hamas’ Military Wing and Hamas Police, according to the IDF. It said Zaher “leveraged his position to foster connections with other Hamas terrorists and promote terror attacks against the Israeli home front.” On Sunday, an airstrike that hit the Nuseirat refugee camp killed at least 35 people, including seven children and nine women, in central Gaza in the early hours of Sunday, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. It’s not clear whether the civilian casualties reported from an air strike in Nuseirat were caused by the targeting of Faki, who belonged to Hamas Police’s office there. Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has joined allies in extending condolences over the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, whom they likened to a “big brother.” Hezbollah, one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, has clashed with Israel in near-daily cross-border skirmishes since the war in Gaza began. Iran-backed militant groups Hamas and the Houthis have sent condolences to Tehran over the death of the country’s President Ebrahim Raisi. Raisi died in a helicopter crash together with his Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian on Sunday in the East Azerbaijan Province, northwest of Iran. Hours after their deaths were confirmed, Houthi senior official Mohamed Ali Al-Houthi sent a message of condolences. The president of the government led by Yemen’s Houthis, Mahdi Al-Mashat, “sent a message of condolences and condolences” to Iran after Raisi’s death. Hamas said it is extending “its sincere condolences, deep sympathy, and solidarity” to the supreme leader, “to the Iranian government, and to the brotherly Iranian people.” Iran has provided military and economic backing to Hamas and the Houthis. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi was killed along with the country’s foreign minister in a helicopter crash on Sunday, at an especially fraught moment in the Middle East. As the war wages in Gaza, Iran-backed militias, such as Hezbollah and the Houthis, have been fighting Israeli forces in other parts of the region. Last month, Iran launched an unprecedented drone-and-missile attack on Israel in response to a deadly apparent Israeli airstrike that killed a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards. Israel struck back a week later. Raisi’s death could cast a further shadow on the stability of the region. Here are the latest developments in the region: Meanwhile, in Israel: The death of Iran’s president and foreign minister in a helicopter crash on a remote mountainside comes at an especially fraught moment in the Middle East – and for Iran domestically. Israel’s war against Hamas and the subsequent humanitarian catastrophe that has unfolded in Gaza over the last seven months has inflamed global opinion and sent tensions soaring across the Middle East. It has also brought a decades-long shadow war between Iran and Israel out into the open. Last month, Iran launched an unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel — its first direct attack on the country — in response to a deadly apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus that killed a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC). Israel struck back a week later, according to US officials, hitting targets outside the Iranian city of Isfahan with a much smaller, calibrated response. Since then the tit-for-tat direct strikes between the two have stopped. But the proxy war continues with Iran-backed militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah continuing to fight Israel’s forces. Meanwhile, Iran’s hardline leadership has weathered an explosion of recent popular dissent on the streets at home where years of US-led sanctions have hit hard. The country was convulsed by youth-led demonstrations against clerical rule and worsening economic conditions following the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran’s notorious morality police. Iranian authorities have since launched a widening crackdown on dissent in response to the protests. That crackdown has led to human rights violations, some of which amount to “crimes against humanity,” according to a United Nations report released in March. And while the protests have largely stopped, opposition to clerical leadership remains deeply entrenched among many Iranians, especially the young, who yearn for reform, jobs and a move away from stifling religious rule. A former hardline judiciary chief with his own brutal human rights record, Raisi was elected president in 2021 in a vote heavily engineered by the Islamic Republic’s political elite so that he would run virtually uncontested. Raisi defeated a more moderate candidate and his victory was seen to signal the start of a new harder-line era in Iran. Yet turnout for that election was just 41 percent, a record low. The powers of Iran’s president are ultimately dwarfed by those of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is the final arbiter of domestic and foreign affairs in the Islamic Republic. With Raisi dead, it is likely new elections will have to be held. The Iranian constitution mandates that the Vice President — currently Mohammad Mokhbar — will assume the position of interim president and that new presidential elections will be held within 50 days. That means Iran’s clerical establishment, headed by Khamenei, must now find a new leader they can throw their support behind against a backdrop of intense regional insecurity and domestic discontent. The Israeli military released a Hamas propaganda video it said it recovered, which shows a child who was held hostage by Hamas, spokesperson Daniel Hagari said on Sunday. Hagari did not say when or where the video was recovered. The sisters were kidnapped from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7 Hamas attack and were released on November 26 as part of the temporary truce. The video shows Ela Elyakim speaking to the camera asking to be released. The military also released a photo showing Ela with her sister Dafna Elyakim by her side in front of a flag with the Hamas logo. In the video, Ela says in Hebrew: “My name is Ela Elyakim, daughter of Noam and I am eight years old, and I am asking to release us and I am a hostage of Hamas” “8-year-old Ela Elyakim told us that Hamas terrorists forced her to read from a script, forced her to change her clothes, and forced her to re-film this terrifying scene over and over and over again,” Hagari said. The family of the sisters approved the military publishing the video, Hagari said. CNN has decided not to air the video but to show the still image of the two sisters. Read the full story. US President Joe Biden said he has called for an “immediate ceasefire” in Gaza while delivering a commencement address Sunday at Morehouse College in Atlanta. “What’s happening in Gaza and Israel is heartbreaking,” he said. Some context: Biden is spoke at the graduation ceremony for one of the nation’s preeminent historically Black colleges at a time when pro-Palestinian protests are roiling college campuses. The Israel Defense Forces has further detailed Sunday its ground operations around the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza, now into their second week. The IDF said it has made dozens of strikes in the area to assist the forces who are fighting “armed terrorist cells” on the ground. The military said “the soldiers have located large quantities of weapons, including explosives, anti-tank missiles, AK-47s, drones and grenades.” The Israeli military has re-entered parts of northern and central Gaza, it says, to combat efforts by Hamas to re-establish itself in these areas. Reports from the ground: Displaced Palestinians in Jabalya tell CNN that heavy Israeli bombardment has wrought “death and horror” at the camp. About 300 houses were completely destroyed over the course of seven days, according to Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesperson for the civil defense emergency services in Gaza. Bassal’s teams had recovered at least 150 bodies and rescued hundreds of wounded people at the refugee camp as of Saturday, he told CNN. In southern Gaza: The IDF said the Israeli Air Force killed a senior Hamas operative in Rafah. The IDF claims he was actively involved in the smuggling of weapons and funds in Gaza. Overall, the IDF said the Air Force had struck dozens of targets, including what it claimed were “two tactical-level Hamas commanders who were preparing to attack IDF troops in the Rafah area.” The parents of Shani Louk, the German-Israeli woman who was killed while trying to escape the Nova music festival on October 7, have expressed their gratitude at being able to lay her body to rest after it was recovered from the Gaza Strip in an Israel Defense Forces operation. “I was relieved, because we didn’t know where she was,” Shani’s father, Nissim Louk, said during an interview with i24 News. “Maybe they threw her into a well or maybe she’s buried somewhere.” Nissim had previously told Israeli media that his daughter’s body was very well-preserved because it had been kept in a “deep and very cold tunnel.” Louk’s remains were retrieved alongside the bodies of two others who were taken hostage on October 7 and killed while escaping the music festival: Amit Bouskila and Itshak Gelernter. Louk, 23, attended the Nova music festival just inside Israel before it was attacked by gunmen from Palestinian militant group Hamas. Her lifeless body was seen in video on the back of a Hamas truck after the attack. She was declared dead by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs in late October. A source involved with her identification told CNN Louk’s death was announced after forensic examiners found a bone fragment from her skull. An airstrike in central Gaza in the early hours of Sunday killed 35 people, including seven children and nine women, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital. The hospital said the death toll from the strike in Nuseirat camp had steadily risen as more bodies were brought in. It appears many of the casualties resulted from the destruction of a block of houses in the area. Video showed civil defense teams pulling bodies from the rubble, but without heavy equipment to move the larger parts of the wreckage. One woman, Um Mohammad Taha, told CNN Sunday that five houses had collapsed, including her sister’s, and that many were buried under the rubble, including children. Mahomoud Abu Bilal told CNN that the strike occurred around 3 a.m., and that some 25 bodies from four or five families had been pulled from the rubble. CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces for a response on the airstrike in Nuseirat.",live coverage israel war gaza moved nearly metric ton humanitarian aid delivered across temporary pier gaza far

cnn,Iran’s President Raisi killed in helicopter crash,"May 20, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/raisi-iran-president-helicopter-crash-05-20-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Read more about the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi here. Reaction to the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi continued to filter through on Monday. Read more on the international reaction here. Iran’s chief of staff of the Armed Forces, Mohammad Bagheri, has ordered an investigation into the cause of the helicopter crash that killed President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Tasnim news agency said. A high-ranking delegation, headed by a military commander and including technical experts, will go to the crash site in Eastern Azerbaijan, Tasnim said. The helicopter crashed in a remote mountainous region in northwestern Iran on Sunday, killing Raisi, his foreign minister and seven others. The upcoming, early election to replace Ebrahim Raisi as president could be a “watershed moment for Iran” if the country’s supreme leader allows a range of candidates to stand, a Middle East expert has told CNN. “I would argue that the most consequential immediate impact of his death is who will come in his wake,” Mohammad Ali Shabani, the editor of Amwaj.media, told CNN’s Becky Anderson Monday. “That election can be a watershed moment for Iran,” he said. Shabani conceded that Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei “is more inclined towards conservative rule than to open up the political space.” But he said Khamenei “has always emphasized voter turnout as a litmus test of the legitimacy of the system.” Raisi became president of Iran in June 2021 after winning a historically uncompetitive presidential election. Many reform-minded Iranians had refused to take part in an election widely seen as a foregone conclusion, and turnout slumped below 50%. Khamenei “has now… a golden opportunity to, in a face-saving way, reverse course” by allowing competitive elections and encouraging turnout, Shabani said. The body of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and the other victims of Sunday’s helicopter crash will be transferred on Tuesday from Tabriz to the northeastern city of Mashhad, where Raisi was born, according to Fars news. A large public ceremony is scheduled to take place at a prayer hall in Tabriz at 4 p.m. local time on Monday, Fars news reported. At 9 a.m. local time on Tuesday, a large procession will accompany the bodies of Raisi and the other victims from Tabriz Martyr’s Square to the city’s airport. From there, the bodies will be moved to Mashhad, according to Fars. Raisi was born in Mashhad in 1960. He ran the powerful charity known as Astan-e Quds-e Razavi, which manages the huge Imam Reza shrine, a major Islamic holy site in the city. Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi was confirmed dead by state media on Monday morning, after a helicopter he was traveling in alongside Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and seven others crashed in foggy conditions in the country’s remote northwest on Sunday. Here’s what to know now: Acting president: In the wake of Raisi’s death, Vice President Mohammad Mokhber has been appointed as acting president. Acting foreign minister: Ali Bagheri Kani, who has led Iranian delegations through indirect negotiations with the United States over nuclear issues and prisoner exchanges, has been appointed acting foreign minister after the death of Amir-Abdollahian, state news agency IRNA reported. New elections: The Iranian constitution mandates that the three heads of the branches of government, including the vice president, speaker of the parliament, and head of the judiciary, must arrange for an election and elect a new leader within 50 days of assuming the role of acting President. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a message to state news agencies that Mokhber was responsible for organizing elections for a new president within that time. Public mourning: Ayatollah Khamenei has announced five days of public mourning after the crash, and expressed his condolences. All cultural and arts activities have been canceled in Iran for the next seven days. Global reaction: The loss of Raisi — a conservative hardliner and protege of Ayatollah Khamenei — is expected to sow further uncertainty in a country already buckling under significant economic and political strain, with tensions with nearby Israel at a dangerous high. His death has already triggered international reaction with Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India and the UAE leader expressing their condolences for his death. Lebanon has declared three days of mourning. Militias respond: Iran-backed militant groups Hamas, the Houthis, and Hezbollah have sent condolences to Tehran over the death of Raisi. All cultural and arts activities in Iran will be suspended for seven days following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi, the Ministry of Culture announced on Monday. Raisi died in a helicopter crash at age 63. The country’s foreign minister and seven others were also killed after the crash in a remote, mountainous area of Iran’s northwest. Iran’s acting president Mohammad Mokhber held an “extraordinary meeting” on Monday with the heads of the legislative and judicial branches following the announcement of President Ebrahim Raisi’s death, according to Iranian state media. Mokhber spoke with Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and Hujjat al-Islam Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje’i, the head of Iran’s Judiciary, according to Iran’s semi-official Tasnim News. The three expressed their condolences and reaffirmed the three branches of government will continue its duties to the nation “without any interruption,” Tasnim reported. Ali Bagheri Kani, who has led Iranian delegations through indirect negotiations with the United States over nuclear issues and prisoner exchanges, has been appointed acting foreign minister after the death of Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, state news agency IRNA reported. Amir-Abdollahian was among the nine people killed in a helicopter crash in Iran’s remote northwestern mountainous region on Sunday, along with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announced five days of public mourning after a helicopter crash killed President Ebrahim Raisi, the country’s foreign minister, and seven others. In a message carried by Iran’s state news agencies, Khamenei expressed his condolences over the deaths and confirmed Iran’s first Vice President Mohammad Mokhber is now managing the executive branch. Russian President Vladimir Putin described Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi as an “outstanding politician” and said his death was an “irreparable loss,” according to a statement from the Kremlin. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov described Raisi and Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian as “true, reliable friends of our country” and added that it was “deeply saddened” by their deaths. The increasingly close relationship between Russia and Iran has become more evident since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Iran has provided Russia with Shahed drones that have been used to fire on Ukraine. The spokesperson for Iran’s Guardian Council – a powerful 12-member council in charge of  overseeing elections and legislation – has called the death of President Ebrahim Raisi  “a great loss for the Iranian nation.” Spokesman Hadi Tahan Nazif said that while Iran is facing a tragedy with the death of its president, Iran’s constitution has foreseen the necessary measures for this situation. Iranian constitution mandates that the three heads of the branches of government, including the vice president, speaker of the parliament, and head of the judiciary, must arrange for an election and elect a new leader within 50 days of assuming the role of acting President. It will “not be very difficult” to fill the gap after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi’s death, a Tel Aviv-based analyst told CNN. “President Raisi was not a very successful president in terms of the economy,” Meir Javedanfar, director of Middle East Economic and Political Analysis Company, told CNN. He added that Raisi “was not somebody with a background in security,” nor someone “with a background in Iran’s bureaucracy.” CNN has confirmed the geolocation of the crash site of the helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in the mountainous region of Varzeghan, near the village of Uzi, in Iran’s East Azerbaijan Province. Drone footage and images of the wreckage taken by the Iranian Red Crescent and shown on state media FARS News Agency showed the crash site on a steep, tree-covered hillside. The accident occurred as Raisi and Foreign Minister Amir-Abdollahian were returning from a ceremony to open a dam on Iran’s border with Azerbaijan, state news agency IRNA reported. Seven others in the chopper also died in the crash. The crash site is around 38 miles (61 kilometers) from the dam site on the Iran-Azerbaijan border that the officials were visiting, with the exact location at 38.7189°, 46.6548° It was first geolocated by Nathan Ruser, an analyst on the Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s Cyber, Tech & Security team (ASPI CTS), which CNN later confirmed. The helicopter crashed while traveling to the city of Tabriz, Iran, semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. Lebanon has announced three days of mourning over the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said. Lebanon-based Hezbollah — one of the strongest paramilitary forces in the Middle East — is arguably Iran’s most powerful non-state partner. This post has been updated to correct Najib Mikati’s title. Iran-backed militant groups Hamas, the Houthis, and Hezbollah have sent condolences to Tehran over the death of the country’s President Ebrahim Raisi. Raisi died in a helicopter crash together with his Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian on Sunday in the East Azerbaijan Province, northwest of Iran. Hours after their deaths were confirmed, Houthi senior official Mohamed Ali Al-Houthi sent condolences. The president of the government led by Yemen’s Houthis, Mahdi Al-Mashat, “sent a message of condolences and condolences” to Iran after Raisi’s death. Hamas said it is extending “its sincere condolences, deep sympathy, and solidarity” to the supreme leader, “to the Iranian government, and to the brotherly Iranian people.” Lebanon-based Hezbollah likened Raisi to a “big brother.” Hezbollah, one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, has clashed with Israel in near-daily cross-border skirmishes since the war in Gaza began. Iran has provided military and economic backing to Hamas, the Houthis, and Hezbollah. Leaders across the Middle East and beyond are expressing their condolences after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and eight others were killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday. Those killed also include Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. This post has been updated. The death of President Ebrahim Raisi couldn’t have come at a “more unstable time” for both Iran and the region, according to CNN’s Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour. International outlook Raisi’s death comes as Israel’s war against Hamas continues into its eighth month, fueling a spiraling humanitarian catastrophe and sending regional tensions soaring. “The perennial shadow war between Israel and Iran that had been going on broke into the open over the last several weeks,” Amanpour said. “You can imagine for the United States, for the west, one of the most important issues is the Iran nuclear issue,” she added. Raisi took the presidency as negotiations with the US over how to revive the 2015 nuclear deal stalled. “It’s known that the United States is trying to stabilize issues with Iran, given the volatility of the region right now.” Domestic outlook “Iran faces internal protests and discontent that have been crushed brutally in the aftermath of Mahsa Amini’s death,” Amanpour said, referring to the 22-year-old woman who died in the custody of Iran’s morality police after being arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly. Amanpour noted that Raisi was at one point considered a successor to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is 85. Raisi was no stranger to political crackdowns and was heavily involved in repression in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution that turned the country into an Islamic republic. “He had been overseeing some of the trials of the revolution and at one point signing off on one that led to the execution of thousands of anti-regime officials,” Amanpour said. Watch Christiane Amanpour’s full analysis: The Iranian government expressed its condolences for the deaths of President Ebrahim Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and seven others in a helicopter crash in Iran’s East Azerbaijan Province on Sunday. In a statement Monday, the president’s cabinet praised Raisi as a “hard-working and tireless” president who served the people of Iran to help advance and progress the country. The cabinet also reaffirmed that there “will not be the slightest disturbance” in the administration of Iran in the wake of the deadly crash. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi’s death “comes at a really tricky time” for the country, an analyst said, as the nation looks to find a new person to garner support as well as loyalty to the system. Vakil also noted that Iran recently completed parliamentary elections, for which the turn out was “very low.” “The lowest ever in the history of the Islamic Republic’s 45 years,” she said. “To go through another political transition with less public participation and to try and find a new individual that could generate support from the population as well as loyalty to the system will be tricky.” Vakil noted that “not too much” may change in terms of foreign policy, but the domestic landscape, which is “notoriously divisive,” will shift. Iran will try to ensure everything is under control and that there “will be no chaos” following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi, according to Tehran-based journalist and researcher Abas Aslani. Aslani added that they will want to “make sure the transition happens smoothly.” The Iranian constitution mandates that the vice president — currently Mohammad Mokhbar — will assume the position of interim president and that new presidential elections will be held within 50 days. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi was killed along with the country’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in a helicopter crash on Sunday in the country’s remote northwest, state news media has confirmed. The loss of Raisi — a conservative hardliner and protege of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — is expected to sow further uncertainty in a country already buckling under significant economic and political strain, with tensions with nearby Israel at a dangerous high. Here’s the latest: The bodies of those killed in the helicopter crash that killed Iran’s president will be transported to the city of Tabriz, the head of the Iranian Red Crescent said, according to Iran’s semi-official Tasnim News. President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian were among those killed. Search and rescue efforts have ended, Pir-Hossein Kolivand said. The helicopter crashed while traveling from Iran’s East Azerbaijan province to the city of Tabriz, Tasnim reported. There were low-hanging clouds and cooler-than-average temperatures across the northwestern region of Iran at the time when the helicopter carrying President Ebrahim Raisi and eight others crashed on Sunday. While it is difficult to get reliable weather data in the higher parts of the country, Tabriz, the closest major city to the crash and the intended destination of the helicopter, showed below-average temperatures at a low of 9.2 degrees Celsius (48 degrees Fahrenheit) around the time of the crash. The deadly crash occurred as Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian were returning from a ceremony to open a dam on Iran’s border with Azerbaijan, IRNA reported. Among those onboard were three crew members, the governor of East Azerbaijan Province, an imam, Raisi’s head of security chief, and a bodyguard, according to IRGC-run media outlet Sepah. Iranian state broadcasters are airing Islamic prayers in between their news broadcasts following the announcement that President Ebrahim Raisi and eight others died after the helicopter they were traveling in crashed in Iran’s East Azerbaijan province. Iran’s government convened an “urgent meeting” on Monday, according to Iranian state news agency IRNA. A photo shared by IRNA showed that the chair that Raisi usually sits in was vacant and draped with a black sash in memory of the president. Iran’s stock market was also closed on Monday, according to Iran’s semi-official Tasnim News, which cited a member of the stock exchange’s board of directors. This post has been updated with the stock market’s closure. Verses from the Quran were shared in a post on the X account of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash along with the country’s foreign minister. Raisi was the second-most powerful person in the Islamic Republic’s political structure after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The death of Iran’s president and foreign minister in a helicopter crash on a remote mountainside comes at an especially fraught moment in the Middle East – and for Iran domestically. Israel’s war against Hamas and the subsequent humanitarian catastrophe that has unfolded in Gaza over the last seven months has inflamed global opinion and sent tensions soaring across the Middle East. It has also brought a decades-long shadow war between Iran and Israel out into the open. Last month, Iran launched an unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel — its first direct attack on the country — in response to a deadly apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus that killed a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC). Israel struck back a week later, according to US officials, hitting targets outside the Iranian city of Isfahan with a much smaller, calibrated response. Since then the tit-for-tat direct strikes between the two have stopped. But the proxy war continues with Iran-backed militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah continuing to fight Israel’s forces. Meanwhile, Iran’s hardline leadership has weathered an explosion of recent popular dissent on the streets at home where years of US-led sanctions have hit hard. The country was convulsed by youth-led demonstrations against clerical rule and worsening economic conditions following the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran’s notorious morality police. Iranian authorities have since launched a widening crackdown on dissent in response to the protests. That crackdown has led to human rights violations, some of which amount to “crimes against humanity,” according to a United Nations report released in March. And while the protests have largely stopped, opposition to clerical leadership remains deeply entrenched among many Iranians, especially the young, who yearn for reform, jobs and a move away from stifling religious rule. A former hardline judiciary chief with his own brutal human rights record, Raisi was elected president in 2021 in a vote heavily engineered by the Islamic Republic’s political elite so that he would run virtually uncontested. Raisi defeated a more moderate candidate and his victory was seen to signal the start of a new harder-line era in Iran. Yet turnout for that election was just 41 percent, a record low. The powers of Iran’s president are ultimately dwarfed by those of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is the final arbiter of domestic and foreign affairs in the Islamic Republic. With Raisi dead, it is likely new elections will have to be held. The Iranian constitution mandates that the Vice President — currently Mohammad Mokhbar — will assume the position of interim president and that new presidential elections will be held within 50 days. That means Iran’s clerical establishment, headed by Khamenei, must now find a new leader they can throw their support behind against a backdrop of intense regional insecurity and domestic discontent. Iran’s government convened an “urgent meeting” on Monday following the announcement that President Ebrahim Raisi and the country’s foreign minister were among those who died in a helicopter crash, according to Iranian state news agency IRNA. The chair that Raisi usually sits in was vacant, and was draped with a black sash in memory of the president, according to a photo shared by state news. The timing and details of a mourning procession will be announced in the future, state media FARS News Agency reported. Weather would have played a key role in the helicopter crash that killed Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi, said CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton. Leighton added maintenance of the aircraft would have also played a role, pointing to how Iran has been living under sanctions and using old equipment to transport their high-level leaders. Iranian media has confirmed the death of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi, aged 63, and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian following a helicopter crash in the country’s mountainous province of East Azerbaijan. Iranian state media Press TV and semi-official Tasnim and Mehr news agencies reported all those on board were killed. Reuters also reported the president’s death, citing a senior official. The head of Iran’s Red Crescent, Pir-Hossein Kolivand, said earlier Monday there were no signs of life of those traveling on board the helicopter, Iranian state news IRIB reported. The helicopter carrying nine people ran into trouble in heavy fog while returning from a trip to the Iran-Azerbaijan border, Iranian officials said Sunday. The crash prompted an hours-long search-and-rescue operation with assistance from the European Union and Turkey, among others, but emergency crews were hampered by the fog and plummeting temperatures. Iran will enter a “tumultuous period” following the crash of the helicopter carrying the country’s President Ebrahim Raisi, said Arash Azizi, a contributor at The Atlantic. Azizi spoke to CNN’s Paula Newton before Raisi’s death was confirmed. “The power struggle between different factions in the Islamic republic is surely going to heighten now,” he said Azizi said there could be a lot of infighting but there would not be a constitutional crisis. Azizi also noted that Raisi “had a lot of blood on his hands.” Here’s how succession works in the case of a president’s death. Iran’s president is believed dead after Iranian media agencies reported that “no survivors” were found at the crash site of a helicopter carrying him and eight others. President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian were among the senior officials on board the downed helicopter. Drone footage of the wreckage taken by the Red Crescent and carried on state media FARS News Agency showed the crash site on a steep, wooded hillside, with little remaining of the helicopter beyond a blue and white tail. The Iranian Constitution mandates that in the case of the death of the president, the first vice president shall assume, with the approval of the Supreme Leader, the powers and functions of the president. First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber would assume the role if the current president dies and Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei approves. Officials said earlier that Mokhber was en route to the area where the president’s helicopter went down. Additionally, the constitution mandates the three heads of the branches of government — the vice president, speaker of the parliament and the head of the judiciary — must arrange for an election to choose a new leader within 50 days of the vice president assuming the role of acting president. Keep in mind: Iran’s supreme leader serves as the final arbiter of domestic and foreign affairs in the Islamic Republic, dwarfing the powers of the country’s president. Unlike his predecessor, the moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, Raisi has fostered a close alliance with Khamenei. Many Iranians believe Raisi is being groomed to be elevated to the supreme leadership. Iran’s president and foreign minister are presumed dead after Iranian media agencies reported that “no survivors” were found at the crash site of a helicopter carrying the two men and seven others. Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian were among the senior officials on board the downed helicopter. Drone footage of the wreckage taken by the Red Crescent and carried on state media FARS News Agency showed the crash site on a steep, wooded hillside, with little remaining of the helicopter beyond a blue and white tail. No official announcement of their deaths has yet been made. Reuters news agency also cited an unnamed Iranian official as saying all passengers are feared dead. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi was likely traveling on a Bell 212 helicopter that began operating in the late 1960s, according to CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton. Leighton told CNN’s Paula Newton that the difficulty in obtaining spare parts could have played a factor in the crash. The helicopter was first produced in the United States and then in Canada, Leighton, a retired US Air Force colonel, said. “So spare parts would have definitely been an issue for the Iranians.” The crash of a helicopter carrying Iran’s president and foreign minister comes at an especially fraught moment in the Middle East – and for Iran domestically. Israel’s war against Hamas and the subsequent humanitarian catastrophe that has unfolded in Gaza over the last seven months has inflamed global opinion and sent tensions soaring across the Middle East. It has also brought a decades-long shadow war between Iran and Israel out into the open. Last month Iran launched an unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel — its first ever direct attack on the country — in response to a deadly apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus that killed a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC). Israel struck back a week later, according to US officials, hitting targets outside the Iranian city of Isfahan with a much smaller, calibrated response. Since then the tit-for-tat direct strikes between the two have stopped. But the proxy war continues with Iran-backed militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah continuing to fight Israel’s forces. Meanwhile, Iran’s hardline leadership has weathered an explosion of recent popular dissent on the streets at home where years of US-led sanctions have hit hard. The country was convulsed by youth-led demonstrations against clerical rule and worsening economic conditions following the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran’s notorious morality police. Iranian authorities have since launched a widening crackdown on dissent in response to the protests. That crackdown has led to human rights violations, some of which amount to “crimes against humanity,” according to a United Nations report released in March. And while the protests for now have largely stopped, opposition to clerical leadership remains deeply entrenched among many Iranians, especially the young, who yearn for reform, jobs and a move away from stifling religious rule. A former hardline judiciary chief with his own brutal human rights record, Raisi was elected president in 2021 in a vote that was heavily engineered by the Islamic Republic’s political elite so that he would run virtually uncontested. While he is president, his powers are dwarfed by those of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is the final arbiter of domestic and foreign affairs in the Islamic Republic. “No survivors” were found at the crash site of the helicopter carrying Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi, Iranian state news agency IRINN and semi-official news agency Mehr News reported. Some background: A former hardline judiciary chief, Raisi was Iran’s eighth president. The former prosecutor and judge was elected in 2021 following a historically uncompetitive presidential contest. He oversaw a period of intensified repression of dissent, according to human rights monitors. Next in the line of succession would be First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber, if approved by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iran’s Supreme Leader serves as the final arbiter of domestic and foreign affairs in the Islamic Republic, dwarfing the powers of the country’s president. Unlike his predecessor, the moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, Raisi had fostered a close alliance with Khamenei. Many Iranians believed Raisi was being groomed to one day succeed the ailing 85-year-old Khamenei. CNN’s Tamara Qiblawi contributed reporting to this post. Nine people were on the helicopter that crashed in northwest Iran on Sunday, including three officials, an imam and flight and security team members, Iran’s Tasnim news reported. The IRGC-run media outlet, Sepah, reported the nine included: Born in 1960, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi attended the seminary in Qom and earned a Ph.D in law from Shahid Motahari University. He started his career as a prosecutor in the early 1980s, and rose from being prosecutor general of Tehran in 1994 to chief justice of the country by 2019. His two years as Iran’s chief justice were marked by the intensified repression of dissent and human rights abuses, according to the Center for Human Rights in Iran. Raisi became president of Iran on June 19, 2021, after winning a historically uncompetitive presidential election. Many reform-minded Iranians had refused to take part in an election widely seen as a foregone conclusion. Overall voter turnout was only 48.8% – the lowest since the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979. The US sanctioned Raisi in November 2019, citing his participation in the 1988 “death commission” as a prosecutor, and a United Nations report indicating that Iran’s judiciary approved the execution of at least nine children between 2018 and 2019. He is the first elected Iranian leader to be under U.S. sanctions. In 2021, he was elected to the presidency in a contest heavily engineered by the Islamic Republic’s political elite so that he would run virtually unchallenged. His inauguration was seen to signal the start of a new, harder-line era that could herald major shifts in the Islamic Republic’s policies at home and abroad. Raisi has long opposed engagement with the West and is a close ally of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Read more about Raisi’s life.

Rescuers have reached the crash site of the helicopter carrying President Ebrahim Raisi, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency. The agency did not say the condition of those who were on board the helicopter. At least 73 rescue teams are in the area of the helicopter crash near the village of Tavil in Iran’s East Azerbaijan province, according to Pir-Hossein Kolivand, head of the Iranian Red Crescent, Tasnim reported. Kolivand said the “the situation is not good,” according to Iranian state news IRNA. The crash site of the helicopter carrying Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi has been located, Iranian state news agency IRNA and semi-official news outlet ISNA reported on Monday. The helicopter crashed in a remote part of the country on Sunday. As president of Iran, Raisi is the second most powerful individual in the Islamic Republic’s political structure after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He became president in a historically uncompetitive election in 2021, and he has overseen a period of intensified repression of dissent in a nation convulsed by youth-led protests against religious clerical rule. The crash comes at a fraught moment in the Middle East, with war raging in Gaza and weeks after Iran launched a drone-and-missile attack on Israel in response to a deadly strike on its diplomatic compound in Damascus. Here’s what to know: The crash site of the helicopter carrying Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and the country’s foreign minister has been located, Iranian state news agency IRNA and semi-official news outlet ISNA reported on Monday. Rescuers are approaching the scene of the accident, ISNA said, citing Pir-Hossein Kolivand, head of the Iranian Red Crescent. State media did not give the exact location of the site. More to follow. The crash of a helicopter carrying Iran’s president and foreign minister comes at an especially fraught moment in the Middle East – and for Iran domestically. Israel’s war against Hamas and the subsequent humanitarian catastrophe that has unfolded in Gaza over the last seven months has inflamed global opinion and sent tensions soaring across the Middle East. It has also brought a decades-long shadow war between Iran and Israel out into the open. Last month Iran launched an unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel — its first ever direct attack on the country — in response to a deadly apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus that killed a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC). Israel struck back a week later, according to US officials, hitting targets outside the Iranian city of Isfahan with a much smaller, calibrated response. Since then the tit-for-tat direct strikes between the two have stopped. But the proxy war continues with Iran-backed militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah continuing to fight Israel’s forces. Meanwhile, Iran’s hardline leadership has weathered an explosion of recent popular dissent on the streets at home where years of US-led sanctions have hit hard. The country was convulsed by youth-led demonstrations against clerical rule and worsening economic conditions following the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran’s notorious morality police. Iranian authorities have since launched a widening crackdown on dissent in response to the protests. That crackdown has led to human rights violations, some of which amount to “crimes against humanity,” according to a United Nations report released in March. And while the protests for now have largely stopped, opposition to clerical leadership remains deeply entrenched among many Iranians, especially the young, who yearn for reform, jobs and a move away from stifling religious rule. A former hardline judiciary chief with his own brutal human rights record, Raisi was elected president in 2021 in a vote that was heavily engineered by the Islamic Republic’s political elite so that he would run virtually uncontested. While he is president, his powers are dwarfed by those of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who is the final arbiter of domestic and foreign affairs in the Islamic Republic. Search and rescue teams have arrived at the location where a heat source was identified in the mountainous region of Iran’s East Azerbaijan province, but have not yet located the crash site of the helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, Iran’s semi-official FARS news agency reported. Authorities had believed the site of the heat source could be related to where the helicopter carrying nine people including President Raisi and the country’s foreign minister crashed. Search efforts continued throughout the night and into daylight on Monday to locate the site of the crash under difficult weather conditions with dense fog and extreme cold. China said it was deeply concerned over the “hard landing” of the helicopter carrying Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi, according to a statement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The statement adds it hopes Raisi and the others aboard are safe and sound. Representatives from Iraq, Pakistan, India, Armenia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the European Union also offered to provide support to the rescue operations. Turkey and Russia have said they are sending aircraft to help in search operations. A Turkish drone helping to search for the location where a helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi crashed has identified a heat source in the mountains of the country’s East Azerbaijan province, according to Iranian state media and Turkish news agency Anadolu. The condition of those on board the helicopter is still unknown. A burning spot has been detected and rescue forces are being sent to that area known as Tavil, the country’s semi-official FARS news agency reported. The Turkish drone identified the heat source and shares its coordinates with Iranian authorities, Anadolu reported. Nine people were on the helicopter that crashed in northwest Iran on Sunday, including three officials, an imam and flight and security team members, Iran’s Tasnim news reported. The IRGC-run media outlet, Sepah, reported the nine included: Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian; Governor of Eastern Azerbaijan province Malek Rahmati, Tabriz’s Friday prayer Imam Mohammad Ali Alehashem as well as a pilot, copilot, crew chief, head of security and another bodyguard. Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed appreciation to numerous nations and international organizations for their support during the search and rescue operation after the helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian and other officials crashed Sunday. “The Islamic Republic of Iran sincerely thanks the numerous governments, nations, and international organizations for their expressions of human emotion and solidarity with the government and people of Iran, as well as their offers of help and assistance for the search and rescue operation,” the statement said. Among the leaders expressing support were those from Iraq, Pakistan and India. Armenia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the European Union also offered to provide support to the rescue operations in posts on X. Turkey and Russia have said they are sending aircraft to help in search operations. Russia plans to send special aircraft and 50 professional mountain rescuers to the site in northern Iran where a helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi crashed Sunday, according to the Iranian state news agency IRNA. Two special Russian helicopters will be sent to the crash site from Armenia, according to IRNA, which reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the move. The helicopter carrying Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and a number of other officials crashed in a northern region of the country Sunday, IRNA reported. Iranian officials said dense fog made the search difficult in the remote, mountainous East Azerbaijan Province, while extreme cold is further complicating rescue efforts. Rescue crews haven’t yet located the crash site of the helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, the head of Iran’s Red Crescent Society, Pir-Hossein Koulivand, told Iranian state TV IRINN. Earlier, a military commander said the aircraft’s exact location had been detected through a signal from the helicopter and a mobile phone of a crew member, according to state news agency IRNA. The crews are still searching around where the signals were detected, Koulivand said. Harsh weather conditions and heavy fog have made the search for the crash site very difficult. It is now just after 1 a.m. local time in the remote, mountainous province. It’s now past 11:30 p.m. local time in the remote, mountainous region where the Iranian president’s helicopter crashed this afternoon. It has been approximately 10 hours since authorities lost contact with President Ebrahim Raisi’s helicopter in the country’s East Azerbaijan Province, where dense fog hindered search efforts during the day. Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency warned that extreme cold would only hinder the search further as night fell. The overnight low temperature in the nearest city of Tabriz will be in the low 50s on Sunday. It’s difficult to obtain precise weather data from the remote mountains where the crash took place, but temperatures there will dip closer to freezing, according to CNN meteorologists. Iranian officials say they have located the exact crash site and are sending teams there. Earlier, authorities managed to make contact with two people who had been aboard the aircraft, according to a government spokesperson. Military crews are heading to the exact location of the crash site of the helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, a military commander in the region said, according to state news agency IRNA. A signal was received from the helicopter and the mobile phone of one of the crew members at the crash site, according to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander for East Azerbaijan province, where the crash occurred. Iran has requested assistance from Turkey in the search for Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi’s crashed helicopter, the Turkish disaster and emergency management ministry said Sunday. Iran requested a night vision search and rescue helicopter, the ministry said. Turkey is also sending six vehicles and 32 mountaineer search and rescue personnel to Iran, according to the ministry. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on X that his government is “following the incident closely, in full contact and coordination with the Iranian authorities.” “On behalf of my nation, I convey my get well wishes to our neighbor, friend and brother Iranian people and government, and I hope to receive good news from Mr. President and his delegation as soon as possible,” Erdoğan added. Remember: It’s about 11 p.m. local time in the remote, mountainous East Azerbaijan Province where the president’s helicopter went down. Even in daylight, dense fog in the area had hindered the search effort. CNN’s Nechirvan Mando and Gul Tuysuz contributed to this post. Hamas issued a statement expressing “great concern” after a helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and other Iranian officials crashed on Sunday. Details about the crash are still murky, and Hamas expressed “solidarity” toward the president and the “brotherly Iranian people.” Some context: Tensions remain acute across the Middle East as Israel wages war in Gaza against the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which is an Iranian ally. Meanwhile, a decades-long shadow conflict between Israel and Iran erupted into the open in April, when Iran launched an unprecedented attack on Israel. Tehran said the assault was retaliation for a deadly suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Syria. The exchange has only further inflamed tensions in the Middle East. Iranian proxy groups — including the Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon — have also been involved in escalating skirmishes in the region. Iranian officials have spoken to two people on the same helicopter as President Ebrahim Raisi since it crashed Sunday, Iranian Vice President for Executive Affairs Mohsen Mansouri told the country’s semi-official FARS news agency. Three helicopters were flying on the same route before two lost contact with Raisi’s helicopter, Mansouri said. “The Ministry of Communications and other security agencies have identified the incident area within a 2-kilometer radius. Due to weather conditions, access to the area is challenging,” he said. Leaders across the Middle East and beyond are expressing their sympathies and concern about Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and other officials, after their helicopter crashed into the mountainous East Azerbaijan Province on Sunday. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expressed concern and said he is praying for Raisi in his first comments since the crash, according to state news agency IRNA: Despite rising tensions between Pakistan and Iran following a series of strikes early this year, Pakistan’s top leaders both sent prayers and best wishes to the entire Iranian nation. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, wrote on X, “My heartfelt prayers & good wishes for the well-being & safety of President Raisi so that he may continue to serve the Iranian nation.” Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, wrote on X, “Waiting with great anxiety for good news that all is well. Our prayers and best wishes are with Hon.President Raisi and the entire Iranian nation.” Here’s what other leaders are saying: The exact site where Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi’s helicopter crashed Sunday has still not been located, military officials involved in the rescue operation said. Officials have said rescuers are facing dense fog and extreme cold as the night grows later in Iran. It’s currently just before 9:30 p.m. local time. The European Union is activating the Copernicus EMS satellite mapping service in response to the crash, following an “Iranian request for assistance,” European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič said in a post on X. The Iranian Constitution mandates that in the case of the death of the president, the first vice president shall assume, with the approval of the Supreme Leader, the powers and functions of the president. First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber would assume the role if the current president dies and Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei approves. Officials said earlier that Mokhber was en route to the area where the president’s helicopter went down. Additionally, the constitution mandates the three heads of the branches of government — the vice president, speaker of the parliament and the head of the judiciary — must arrange for an election to choose a new leader within 50 days of the vice president assuming the role of acting president. Keep in mind: Iran’s supreme leader serves as the final arbiter of domestic and foreign affairs in the Islamic Republic, dwarfing the powers of the country’s president. Unlike his predecessor, the moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, Raisi has fostered a close alliance with Khamenei. Many Iranians believe Raisi is being groomed to be elevated to the supreme leadership. US President Joe Biden was briefed on the helicopter crash involving Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, according to the White House. Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, accompanying Biden aboard Air Force One on Sunday, offered no other details. Rescuers have not reached the crash site of a helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and have no update on their status, according to Iran government spokesperson Ali Bahadori Jahromi. In a statement on X, Jahromi said rescue teams are “experiencing difficult and complicated conditions,” and acknowledged it is “the right of the people and the media to be aware of the latest news about the president’s helicopter accident, but according to the coordinates of the accident site and the weather conditions, there is ‘no’ new news until now.” Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said his country is ready to provide support after a helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi crashed Sunday in a remote, mountainous province near the border between the two countries. Iranian state news agency Press TV reported Raisi and Aliyev inaugurated a dam project on the border Sunday, prior to the crash in Iran’s East Azerbaijan Province. Part of the province’s northern border is shared with Azerbaijan. Rescue teams are making all attempts to reach the Iranian president’s helicopter quickly, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency reports. Weather reports indicate that in the next two hours, the weather is expected to become extremely cold in the crash site area, which could prevent the rescuers from progressing, Tasnim reports. The Iranian government is asking for patience, prayer, and trust in the rescuers who are attempting to reach the site, government spokesperson Ali Bahadori-Jahromi said in a post on X. The Red Crescent, rescue teams, mountaineers and other rescue groups hope to arrive at the location of the possible coordinates of the president’s helicopter in less than half an hour, Tasnim reports. Iran’s First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber is en route to Tabriz, the area where the president’s helicopter crashed earlier Sunday, the spokesperson Jahromi said. Some other government officials are en route with him. Adam Pourahmadi contributed to this report. Born in 1960, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi attended the seminary in Qom and earned a Ph.D in law from Shahid Motahari University. He started his career as a prosecutor in the early 1980s, and rose from being prosecutor general of Tehran in 1994 to chief justice of the country by 2019. His two years as Iran’s chief justice were marked by the intensified repression of dissent and human rights abuses, according to the Center for Human Rights in Iran. Raisi became president of Iran on June 19, 2021, after winning a historically uncompetitive presidential election. Many reform-minded Iranians had refused to take part in an election widely seen as a foregone conclusion. Overall voter turnout was only 48.8% – the lowest since the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979. The US Department of the Treasury sanctioned Raisi in November 2019, citing his participation in the 1988 “death commission” as a prosecutor, and a United Nations report indicating that Iran’s judiciary approved the execution of at least nine children between 2018 and 2019. He is the first elected Iranian leader to be under U.S. sanctions. In 2021, he was elected to the presidency in a contest heavily engineered by the Islamic Republic’s political elite so that he would run virtually unchallenged. His inauguration was seen to signal the start of a new, harder-line era that could herald major shifts in the Islamic Republic’s policies at home and abroad. Raisi has long opposed engagement with the West, and is a close ally of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei. Read more details about Raisi’s life here. Correction: This post has been updated to remove a reference to former President Hassan Rouhani running in the 2021 election. The official Instagram account of President Ebrahim Raisi and state television urged Iranians Sunday to pray for the president and his entourage after the helicopter they were traveling in crashed in the country’s East Azerbaijan Province. “We call on fellow countrymen to pray for the wellbeing of the President and companions,” a story shared on Raisi’s Instagram said. Raisi’s condition is currently unknown, Iranian state news agency IRNA has reported. The site where a helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi crashed Sunday is very foggy, making it difficult for rescuers to search, according to Iranian Minister of Health Bahram Eynollahi. “We have set up treatment facilities. We are now in the area and all rescue forces are busy searching,” Eynollahi said on state TV Sunday. “We have deployed all medical facilities, including emergency medicine, surgery and ambulance.” The Iranian military has been in the area of the crash since it was first reported, Armed Forces Chief of Staff Mohammad Bagheri said. The armed forces are also investigating the source of the crash, he said. Twenty rescue teams and drones have been sent to the area where a helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian crashed on Sunday, according to Iranian state news agency IRNA. The pair, along with a group of dignitaries, were aboard the helicopter returning from a ceremony for an opening of a dam on Iran’s border with Azerbaijan when the aircraft “crashed upon landing in Varzaqan region on Sunday,” IRNA English reported. IRNA also reported, citing locals, that the helicopter crashed in the Dizmar Forest area between the villages of Ozi and Pir Davood. Residents said they heard noises from the area, it added. Iran’s interior minister Ahmad Vahidi said one of the helicopters in a convoy was forced to make a hard landing due to foggy weather conditions. He added that there had been some contact with the passengers on the helicopter, but did not have further details. A helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi crashed while visiting a northern region and his condition is currently unknown, Iranian state news agency IRNA reported Sunday. The aircraft, which was also carrying Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, came down in the country’s East Azerbaijan Province and emergency crews have so far been unable to reach it due to foggy conditions, IRNA said. It is unclear what the exact status is of Raisi’s helicopter. “From the beginning of this incident being reported regarding the President’s helicopter, Red Crescent Relief Forces and auxiliary military and law enforcement forces have started a widespread effort to find this helicopter,” state news agency Tasnim reported. The helicopter was part of a convoy of three helicopters. Two of those helicopters were carrying ministers and officials who arrived at their destination safely, according to Tasnim.",iranian medium confirmed death iran president ebrahim raisi live coverage

cnn,Wealth gap on voters’ minds as India’s richest city gears up for the election,"May 16, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/15/india/india-election-mumbai-wealth-gap-issues-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,"For millions of Indians, it’s the city where dreams come true – just look around. From the gleaming home of Asia’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, towering over “Billionaires’ Row,” to the waterfront mansions of Bollywood stars, Mumbai is the place where ambitions are realized. But as India’s financial capital prepares to vote in the country’s massive general election, many residents say they want a fairer share of its wealth – with better education the key to opportunity. In the densely packed Dadar neighborhood, hustlers and dreamers alike spill out of train stations and shopping complexes, a whirl of humanity weaving through congested streets where market traders tout for business. Next to piles of potatoes and onions, 34-year-old grocer Sachin Chaudhary cites rising prices and a tough job market as his biggest concerns ahead of the city’s first voting phase later in May. “The change I want to see is, things should become less costly,” he says. “And children are getting good educations, so there should also be better opportunities in the employment sector.” As India’s wealthiest city, Mumbai is often likened to New York – a place of opportunity where everyone is from somewhere else, hoping to make it big and support their families, often in poorer rural hometowns. But amid the glitz and glam, India’s other half is just as evident. Near tourist hotspots like the iconic Gateway of India, day laborers toil in the stifling heat, carrying heavy loads on their shoulders or selling knickknacks on the side of dusty roads. The disparity concerns Rajani Bhat, a 42-year-old Mumbai resident with short, spiky hair and an assertive voice. “I’m worried about the protection of women, especially small girls,” she says from a street dotted with jewelry and clothes stores. “They are selling dustbin bags, they are doing multiple (jobs), but what about their education? They have parents, but the thing is they (don’t have the right) financial conditions,” she said. “Somebody should do something for them.” Many poor children in the city are not even 10 years old when they start helping their parents to earn a living. It’s especially common in Mumbai’s infamous slums, which were depicted in the 2008 Oscar-winning film “Slumdog Millionaire.” Kalpita Shinde, a 43-year-old government worker, also highlights the need for India’s next government to provide its people with greater upward mobility. “All should have employment, and the jobs should be on par with the better education opportunities we have,” she says. “If people have good jobs, then it’s not just the individual who grows. The whole family also grows and leads a better life.” Banker Helen D’Souza, 60, agreed with that sentiment. “I think there’s a lot to be done in this country, as regards (to) the middle class,” she said over the thrum of Dadar’s traffic. “A lot of people are unhappy … When you don’t get something, you lose trust.” Every Mumbaikar who spoke to CNN emphasized the importance of voting as a civic duty, but only supporters of one party openly expressed their voting intentions. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are widely expected to win a third straight five-year term this election, extending his popular but controversial rule into a second decade. That dominance is reflected in the sheer amount of BJP campaign material displayed across the city, with scant signs of India’s opposition. Modi’s face beams from billboards and hangs off bridges, posters listing his achievements and election promises. For Bhat, the answer to India’s poverty-stricken girls and women lies in Modi, who has been credited with boosting the country’s economy, infrastructure and global standing. “I want Narendra Modi – that’s it. He’s a true leader,” she says. “Before Narendra Modi, nobody was aware about who’s the president, who’s the prime minister. “But now everybody’s aware of that because he’s going out, keeping relationships (with other countries), so that our country can cope with upcoming problems.” Chatting to CNN between sips from a paper cup of chai, salesperson Parag Sawla, 42, echoes that sentiment. “I will vote for the BJP as they are the perfect party,” he says. “For me in this election, we need a party that focuses not only on global issues but on issues that matter to individuals in the country.” But not every BJP voter is so enthusiastic. “There is no strong opposition, so I will vote for the BJP, as there are no other (significant) political parties. The BJP is ruling everywhere,” says Chaudhary, the vegetable seller. “If there was a strong opposition, I would have more choice – but sadly, we don’t.” Education and employment aside, several other issues loom in the minds of Mumbai’s voters – especially longstanding religious tensions that have spiraled under Modi’s tenure. Modi and his BJP have been accused of driving religious polarization with Hindu-nationalist policies, giving rise to a wave of Islamophobia and deadly communal clashes. Many of the country’s 230 million Muslims say they are being sidelined and marginalized in the world’s largest democracy. One major point of contention is the BJP’s attempt to pass a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), a set of common laws for personal matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance – replacing religious laws followed by different groups. Some critics fear the government’s Hindu-nationalist policies could unduly influence the legislation, further threatening the rights and freedoms of minorities. Others, however, say the reform of religious laws represents progress. Sanjay Sardesai, a 60-year-old retired airline worker, wouldn’t indicate who he’s voting for but says the civil code is the most important election issue. “It means that all sections of society, irrespective of their religion, shall be treated equally,” he tells CNN while resting on his motorbike in Dadar. “That should be implemented so we are given the same rights all across India.”",million indian city dream come true look around gleaming home asia richest man mukesh ambani towering billionaire row waterfront mansion bollywood star mumbai place ambition realized india financial capital prepares vote country massive general election many resident say want fairer share wealth better education key opportunity densely packed dadar neighborhood hustler dreamer alike spill train station shopping complex whirl humanity weaving congested street market trader tout business next pile potato onion yearold grocer sachin chaudhary cite rising price tough job market biggest concern ahead city first voting phase later may change want see thing become le costly say child getting good education also better opportunity employment sector india wealthiest city mumbai often likened new york place opportunity everyone somewhere else hoping make big support family often poorer rural hometown amid glitz glam india half evident near tourist hotspot like iconic gateway india day laborer toil stifling heat carrying heavy load shoulder selling knickknack side dusty road disparity concern rajani bhat yearold mumbai resident short spiky hair assertive voice im worried protection woman especially small girl say street dotted jewelry clothes store selling dustbin bag multiple job education parent thing dont right financial condition said somebody something many poor child city even year old start helping parent earn living especially common mumbai infamous slum depicted oscarwinning film slumdog millionaire kalpita shinde yearold government worker also highlight need india next government provide people greater upward mobility employment job par better education opportunity say people good job individual grows whole family also grows lead better life banker helen dsouza agreed sentiment think there lot done country regard middle class said thrum dadars traffic lot people unhappy dont get something lose trust every mumbaikar spoke cnn emphasized importance voting civic duty supporter one party openly expressed voting intention ruling bharatiya janata party bjp prime minister narendra modi widely expected win third straight fiveyear term election extending popular controversial rule second decade dominance reflected sheer amount bjp campaign material displayed across city scant sign india opposition modis face beam billboard hang bridge poster listing achievement election promise bhat answer india povertystricken girl woman lie modi credited boosting country economy infrastructure global standing want narendra modi thats he true leader say narendra modi nobody aware who president who prime minister everybodys aware he going keeping relationship country country cope upcoming problem chatting cnn sip paper cup chai salesperson parag sawla echo sentiment vote bjp perfect party say election need party focus global issue issue matter individual country every bjp voter enthusiastic strong opposition vote bjp significant political party bjp ruling everywhere say chaudhary vegetable seller strong opposition would choice sadly dont education employment aside several issue loom mind mumbai voter especially longstanding religious tension spiraled modis tenure modi bjp accused driving religious polarization hindunationalist policy giving rise wave islamophobia deadly communal clash many country million muslim say sidelined marginalized world largest democracy one major point contention bjps attempt pas uniform civil code ucc set common law personal matter marriage divorce inheritance replacing religious law followed different group critic fear government hindunationalist policy could unduly influence legislation threatening right freedom minority others however say reform religious law represents progress sanjay sardesai yearold retired airline worker wouldnt indicate he voting say civil code important election issue mean section society irrespective religion shall treated equally tell cnn resting motorbike dadar implemented given right across india,49.0,positive,0
cnn,"In the world’s biggest election, millions of migrants are unable to vote","May 14, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/13/india/india-elections-migrant-workers-voting-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,"Chanu Gupta has lived in India’s financial capital Mumbai nearly his whole life, since arriving as a child from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. But when polls open in the city, the 59-year-old street vendor won’t be able to vote in the nationwide election – along with millions of internal migrant workers who are a major backbone of the country’s economy. “I cannot go vote as I don’t belong to Maharashtra state,” Gupta told CNN in Mumbai’s shopping district Dadar, standing next to the roadside cart where he sells shaved ice and cold drinks. “I have voting rights in another state.” Under India’s election rules, eligible voters can only cast ballots in their constituencies – meaning those working outside of their state have to return home to vote. That’s all but impossible for many out-of-state workers, especially underprivileged daily-wage workers in the unorganized sector. And it’s a huge group – one study estimates there were about 600 million internal migrants in 2020, making up 43% of the country’s nearly 1.4 billion population at the time. These workers are often from poorer rural parts of India, in search of work in bigger cities. Even then, they earn low wages that are usually sent home to support family members. Perhaps nowhere is this starker than Mumbai – India’s richest city and the birthplace of the Bollywood movie industry. Often referred to as the “city of dreams,” Mumbai draws migrants from across the country hoping to find wealth and success. More than 43% of Mumbai’s population were classed as migrants in 2011 during the last national census, according to migration think tank Knomad. Many come from states with higher poverty and unemployment rates such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Gujarat. Signs of that diverse mix are everywhere in Mumbai – the varied languages spoken, the many day laborers across the city, from auto-rickshaw drivers to construction workers and sugarcane juice vendors lining the streets. For these workers, forgoing daily wages to head home to vote would come at a high cost – both in the money they would spend getting there, and lost wages. And those losses have a ripple effect on the family members back home dependent on their income – from children missing out on tuition fees to elderly parents’ rent and food costs. The Covid-19 pandemic only underscored the volatility of migrant workers’ circumstances when millions lost their jobs almost overnight and were forced to go home. “Despite the living expenses being relatively high in large cities as compared to villages, their wages are considerably low causing poor living conditions including limited or non-existent public services such as water and sanitation,” said one United Nations-led study that examined the impact of the pandemic on this segment of the workforce. Gupta said his shaved ice business relies on the hot summer months when the election takes place. “If I go to vote, I lose my business. Earning my living is more important to me than voting as I have to support my family,” he said. “There are many migrants like me who are in Mumbai to earn money and are not able to vote.” Many Indian citizens abroad – part of the massive global Indian diaspora – face the same problem, though their circumstances vary considerably. Most are low-income laborers who helped build the economies and glittering cities of oil-rich Arab nations, while some are middle or upper-class students pursuing an international education or professional career in Western countries. According to government figures, there are 13.6 million such “non-resident Indians,” or NRIs, globally. The biggest group is in the United Arab Emirates, with 3.4 million NRIs, followed by 2.5 million in Saudi Arabia; next is the United States with 1.2 million. The plight of NRIs in Gulf nations – many of whom live in cramped dormitories and labor camps – was also highlighted during the pandemic when businesses shut down, wages dried up and border restrictions prevented them from returning home, leaving them in limbo. For these overseas Indians, there is no such thing as online voting or postal ballots. Instead, NRIs must register as an “overseas voter” then travel to their hometown in India to be physically present in their constituencies to vote. Local media reports highlight some dedicated voters with the means to fly back and vote, such as professionals in the United Kingdom or Dubai. But they remain a tiny minority of NRIs who do so. According to the Election Commission of India, in the last national elections in 2019, more than 71,000 people registered as “overseas voters” – less than 1% of the total NRI population at the time. Indian authorities have pushed hard in recent years to increase turnout, urging all 968 million eligible voters nationwide to cast their ballots – a massive feat that includes setting up more than a million polling stations from remote forests to mountain peaks. The ECI has also launched voter literacy initiatives and social media campaigns targeting young voters. These efforts saw the highest voter turnout in the country’s history in the 2019 election, with more than 67% of Indians going to the polls. The massive group of disenfranchised migrant workers stands in sharp contrast to these achievements – with no solution in sight. In a 2011 study that surveyed workers across five Indian states, 60% of respondents had “missed voting in elections at least once because they were away from home seeking livelihood options.” It added that many migrants left home as young as age 13 to look for work – and did not have time to get their voter IDs when they became eligible at age 18. The ECI acknowledged this problem in a 2022 report, raising the question of how to improve voter participation among internal migrants. One issue the voting body highlighted was the absence of any clear definition of an internal migrant, adding that their inability to vote is a key reason “contributing to low voter turnout.” The ECI said it had proposed remote voting machines to address the problem. But in 2023, the government said there were no such plans. That means for now, voting remains an unlikely reality for many migrant workers. “I cannot say now whom I would vote for if I was in my hometown,” said Gupta, the Mumbai vendor. “That is the last thing on my mind – my focus right now is earning my livelihood.”",chanu gupta lived india financial capital mumbai nearly whole life since arriving child northern state uttar pradesh poll open city yearold street vendor wont able vote nationwide election along million internal migrant worker major backbone country economy go vote dont belong maharashtra state gupta told cnn mumbai shopping district dadar standing next roadside cart sell shaved ice cold drink voting right another state india election rule eligible voter cast ballot constituency meaning working outside state return home vote thats impossible many outofstate worker especially underprivileged dailywage worker unorganized sector huge group one study estimate million internal migrant making country nearly billion population time worker often poorer rural part india search work bigger city even earn low wage usually sent home support family member perhaps nowhere starker mumbai india richest city birthplace bollywood movie industry often referred city dream mumbai draw migrant across country hoping find wealth success mumbai population classed migrant last national census according migration think tank knomad many come state higher poverty unemployment rate uttar pradesh bihar rajasthan gujarat sign diverse mix everywhere mumbai varied language spoken many day laborer across city autorickshaw driver construction worker sugarcane juice vendor lining street worker forgoing daily wage head home vote would come high cost money would spend getting lost wage loss ripple effect family member back home dependent income child missing tuition fee elderly parent rent food cost covid pandemic underscored volatility migrant worker circumstance million lost job almost overnight forced go home despite living expense relatively high large city compared village wage considerably low causing poor living condition including limited nonexistent public service water sanitation said one united nationsled study examined impact pandemic segment workforce gupta said shaved ice business relies hot summer month election take place go vote lose business earning living important voting support family said many migrant like mumbai earn money able vote many indian citizen abroad part massive global indian diaspora face problem though circumstance vary considerably lowincome laborer helped build economy glittering city oilrich arab nation middle upperclass student pursuing international education professional career western country according government figure million nonresident indian nris globally biggest group united arab emirate million nris followed million saudi arabia next united state million plight nris gulf nation many live cramped dormitory labor camp also highlighted pandemic business shut wage dried border restriction prevented returning home leaving limbo overseas indian thing online voting postal ballot instead nris must register overseas voter travel hometown india physically present constituency vote local medium report highlight dedicated voter mean fly back vote professional united kingdom dubai remain tiny minority nris according election commission india last national election people registered overseas voter le total nri population time indian authority pushed hard recent year increase turnout urging million eligible voter nationwide cast ballot massive feat includes setting million polling station remote forest mountain peak eci also launched voter literacy initiative social medium campaign targeting young voter effort saw highest voter turnout country history election indian going poll massive group disenfranchised migrant worker stand sharp contrast achievement solution sight study surveyed worker across five indian state respondent missed voting election least away home seeking livelihood option added many migrant left home young age look work time get voter id became eligible age eci acknowledged problem report raising question improve voter participation among internal migrant one issue voting body highlighted absence clear definition internal migrant adding inability vote key reason contributing low voter turnout eci said proposed remote voting machine address problem government said plan mean voting remains unlikely reality many migrant worker say would vote hometown said gupta mumbai vendor last thing mind focus right earning livelihood,-3.0,neutral,0
cnn,‘The next decade belongs to India’: Meet the winners of rising power’s economic boom,"May 10, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/business/india-election-economic-boom-winners-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,"As Indians head to the polls in a massive ongoing nationwide election, much attention has focused on the country’s explosive growth under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership. During his past decade in office, India’s fast-growing economy has become the world’s fifth largest as the country woos foreign investors and embarks on a massive infrastructure transformation, spending billions on new highways, ports, airports and railways. While not everyone has benefited and income inequality has deepened — millions still live in sprawling slums and youth unemployment has soared — Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are widely expected to win another five-year term and push forward that economic expansion. That’s partly because many in the world’s most populous country, especially among the younger generation, share a common belief: India is on the rise. More than 40% of India’s 1.4 billion people is under 25: a massive, tech-savvy and mostly English-speaking labor force, with their eyes set on the future. Like millions of migrants from across the country, many of them are drawn to the country’s financial capital Mumbai, full of aspiration and ambition. And it’s stories like these that inspire them. As a kid, Javed Khatri loved going to the train station. Not to catch a ride or watch the endless flow of people – but to stand near the ticket booth and glimpse the mainframe computers behind the counter. Growing up poor in the slums of Mumbai, he’d never used a smartphone or computer. The screens and machines at the train station fascinated Khatri, the son of a carpenter and a housewife. “In the region where I used to stay, one of the best things that one could think of was just to complete 10th grade, and then work at a call center or sell vegetables or work at a garage or do some kind of odd jobs,” says Khatri, now 30. “That was our topmost ambition.” But he was lucky, he says. Unlike many children in the slums, his parents encouraged him to focus on education rather than start working young to help support the family. He completed 10th grade – the first person in four generations of his family to do so – then studied computer science at an engineering college. But it was a shock to the system. On his first day, the class was given tasks that Khatri’s more privileged peers sailed through easily. Meanwhile, he was trying to figure out how to use a mouse and type on a keyboard. “That’s where people started mocking me, they started making fun of me,” he tells CNN from the high-rise building where he now works. “I considered quitting engineering at one point in time because it was becoming unbearable.” He sank into a six-month depression — but it was also a transformative period. He threw himself into learning everything he could. Online, he befriended people from around the world on forums, and took entrepreneurship courses. He was so fixated he often only slept four or five hours a night. “That was the hunger to learn back then,” he says. “I got introduced to a whole new world altogether.” He started building apps and small businesses with his classmates, who began seeking out his company after noticing his improved skills. After graduating, he decided to start a mobile app developer with two co-founders and only 20,000 rupees (about $240) to his name. He was under pressure, with his parents and two younger siblings depending on his success. But his company forged ahead, and after several years he sold it for $2 million. He is now building a new online platform to connect tech firms with engineers, and says his success has changed the trajectory of his family. He moved them all out of the slum, and he supports his parents’ early retirement. Both his siblings went to college and pursued their own careers. None of this would have been possible a generation ago, he says. “Over the last 10 years, people have got access to the right kind of information with the help of the internet,” he says. Now, the government is encouraging more startups, with growing awareness around entrepreneurship thanks to business reality shows like “Shark Tank,” and its Indian spin-off. Among India’s large cohort of young people, “more and more people are opting for entrepreneurship and creating more opportunities for the world and the country itself,” he says. “This itself is a big sign that the next decade belongs to India.” When the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, college student Apoorva Mukhija moved back home with her parents — and hated it immediately. In their small township, “everybody knew everybody, everybody talked about each other,” she says. Without good friends nearby, she turned to Instagram and started posting comedy videos. “Content was my only escape, it kept me sane,” she says. “I was genuinely really desperate to talk to somebody, and so the camera was my friend.” It felt like a natural step; Mukhija had always been the class clown, she says. But with much of the world confined to their homes, there was an unprecedented demand for online entertainment – and creators like her. She kept posting videos as she finished her computer science degree, on topics ranging from boredom in class to being reprimanded by parents, gaining hundreds of thousands of followers. But she hadn’t planned to be a content creator, so after graduation she took a job with a tech firm in Bangalore, the southern city known as “India’s Silicon Valley.” “Then one day I just woke up, realized … (my job) just didn’t pay as well as content did, and I hated living in that city,” Mukhija, 22, tells CNN from a pastel-pink couch at her new apartment in Mumbai, which she says is her “dream city.” Her career has thrived, winning her recognition from local media and amassing 1.3 million Instagram followers, many of whom regularly stop her in the street for a selfie. The internet holds a wealth of opportunity for young Indians, Mukhija says. The country’s influencer marketing industry is expected to be worth more than $281 million in 2024, and $405 million by 2026, according to an April report by consultancy EY India. Ubiquitous smartphones and social media are fueling this growth. There is expected to be 740 million active smartphone users in India by 2030, according to EY India. That’s still less than half the population – underscoring the room for growth. And there’s money to be made. Influencer marketing firm Kofluence estimated in a report this year that Indian influencers with more than 1 million Instagram followers can earn anywhere from 300,000 to 1,500,000 rupees (about $3,600 to $18,000) monthly depending on the size of their audience. That’s a handsome sum in a country where the annual gross domestic product per capita is still around $2,400, according to the World Bank. This new, exciting space has opened doors for young creators like Mukhija, who just completed filming in her first acting role. Filmmakers are increasingly seeking out influencers to attract their fanbase, she says, adding: “I don’t go for auditions, auditions come to me.” And, more significantly, she’s been able to share her success with her parents, a civil servant and an English teacher. Though she’d grown up with privileges like private school and domestic family holidays, it was thanks to her parents’ sacrifices, she says. Her father had driven the same car for 16 years despite its frequent breakdowns, and they had never traveled outside India before. So in late 2022, she surprised her family with tickets to Dubai, their first international trip. The video, posted on Instagram, shows her younger brother gleefully jumping on the bed, and her mother wiping her eyes before pulling Mukhija into a hug. “My dad comes from nothing, he has built himself up,” she tells CNN. “So it’s just nice that they’ve given me so much and maybe I can give a fraction of it back to them.” She’s dreaming bigger for herself, too. She has applied to MBA programs in London and California, which wouldn’t have been possible without her content creation income. And with so many people across the country tuning in on their phones, that rise isn’t slowing anytime soon. “Everybody’s a content creator today,” Mukhija says. “And with this much population, you ought to have an audience, no matter what kind of content you’re making … In India, it’s so easy to just find somebody to watch your content.” Jameel Shah caught the Bollywood bug as a teenage runaway, fascinated by the sight of movie stars plastered on billboards in India’s capital. “I wanted to see them, and someone told me I would not find Bollywood stars in Delhi, but in Mumbai,” he says. At age 13, Shah ran away from his village in Bihar, India’s poorest state, where his father wasn’t earning enough from farming to send the kids to school. Seeking work, he ran off to Delhi without telling anyone — but was soon on his way to Mumbai, the birthplace of Hindi cinema. But once in Mumbai, he was scammed out of his savings by a friend who disappeared after making false promises to introduce him to Bollywood stars. He followed the scammer to Bangalore before he ran out of money and became stranded. That proved to be a turning point. Shah started working as a security guard at a building that housed a dance studio, where he watched people whirl and stomp across the floor with wide-eyed intrigue – until the studio owner agreed to let him learn for free. Dancing with female partners was foreign and shocking. “Where I came from, one cannot be at such close proximity with women,” says Shah, 40. “There was a shortage of men in the class, so I was given two women to dance with, which made me very happy.” By the time he returned to Mumbai as an 18-year-old, his passion for dance had taken root and he continued learning for free under a Bollywood choreographer while working odd jobs. Every week, he would walk from his home in Dharavi, Asia’s biggest slum, to dance classes in an affluent nearby district of tall office buildings, upscale hotels and foreign consulates. Seeing all this, “I still wanted to do something better in life,” Shah says. Finally, he saw his opportunity in the expensive imported dance shoes required for class. “I wanted to make similar shoes that were printed with ‘Made in India,’” Shah says. He took two samples back to the narrow alleys of Dharavi, a long-established hub for leather and textile manufacturers. With their expertise, and his own experience working in bag and wallet factories, Shah began experimenting. After four years of trial and error, Shah Shoes was born. The business grew, attracting stylists and choreographers who redistributed the shoes to dance studios. And they even made it onto the big screen. “I have made shoes for a lot of Bollywood stars like Priyanka Chopra and Katrina Kaif. Many times I am not aware that these actors have used my shoes; it’s only when I see them dancing (in movies) I realize that they were made by me because of their unique cut, design and style,” Shah says. One career highlight was when a choreographer introduced him to Kylie Minogue. “She loved my shoes and bought eight pairs,” he says, excitedly showing CNN a photo of himself with the Australian pop star. Some 17 years on, Shah Shoes has helped support his family back in Bihar, including six siblings. He’s bought a house for his parents, and started an education center in his home village teaching literacy to those who can’t afford school. “I never imagined I would reach such an important stage in my life as my only obsession was to meet Bollywood stars. But today I make these wonderful shoes,” he says. A key tool was the rise of social media, particularly Facebook, helping him find customers – which Shah credited to Prime Minister Modi’s push for a “digital India.” And, he added, “my business will just keep growing with the kind of economic growth we see in India.”",indian head poll massive ongoing nationwide election much attention focused country explosive growth prime minister narendra modis

cnn,Asia’s most powerful billionaires are getting drawn into the world’s biggest election,"May 9, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/business/india-elections-ambani-adani-modi-speech-intl-hnk/index.html,"Two of the planet’s richest businessmen are becoming embroiled in  India’s increasingly divisive election campaign. The world’s most populous nation is in the midst of a mammoth election in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is widely expected to secure a rare third consecutive term. Modi is running on his economic record over the past 10 years, a period of robust growth for India, as well as for its two most famous billionaires: Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani. Likened to the industrialists who helped build America’s “Gilded Age,” both men are considered vocal champions of Modi and their perceived closeness has been the subject of intense criticism by rival politicians. But at an election rally on Wednesday, Modi appeared to accuse his primary political opponent of accepting money from Ambani, chairman of India’s most valuable private company Reliance Industries, and Gautam Adani, the founder of ports-to-energy conglomerate the Adani Group. “Why has Shahzade Ji stopped talking of Ambani and Adani in this election all of sudden? People are smelling a secret deal,” Modi said on X, where he posted a video of his speech. Shahzade, or prince, is a widely understood reference to Rahul Gandhi, the longtime face of main opposition party Indian National Congress. “How much money have you taken from Ambani and Adani?” he said at the rally. Gandhi, the scion of a dynasty that has given India three prime ministers, has often asked tough questions about the relationship between Modi and the country’s leading tycoons. “Are you scared, Modi” Gandhi said in a response on X on Wednesday. “This is the first time you have talked about Ambani and Adani in public.” “I want to repeat to the country that the amount of money Modi has given to these businessmen, we are going to give the same amount to India’s poor,” he added, asking for an official investigation into the two conglomerates. Reliance and the Adani Group did not respond to a CNN request for comment. While each candidate has accused the other of receiving truckloads of money illegally from  both businessmen, neither has provided any proof to back their claims. Earlier this year, India’s Supreme Court made a major ruling concerning the often opaque nature of political funding. It declared that a system of anonymous donations introduced by the Modi government in 2017 was “unconstitutional.” The electoral bonds system had allowed individuals or groups to buy bonds from the government-run State Bank of India and donate them anonymously to any political party. Anti-corruption groups have long complained that the system meant a lack of transparency regarding donations to political parties — allowing corporations to donate large sums without disclosure. While Modi’s speech about the billionaires made headlines in India, analysts do not expect his comments to trigger detailed scrutiny by local media or an official investigation. “Given the close ties between legacy media and top businesses in India, there is no major desire to go after crony capitalism in the country,” said Abhinandan Sekhri, co-founder of Newslaundry, an independent news website that focuses on media. Many of India’s leading media companies are owned by large conglomerates that invest in a vast array of industries, and they’re under pressure to stay friendly to the ruling party to ensure favorable policies for their other businesses, analysts have said. Adani took over NDTV, an influential broadcaster, in 2022, while Ambani owns Network 18, which includes the CNN-News18 TV channel, a CNN affiliate. In the last decade, both Ambani and Adani have stunned the world with their success and influence. Ambani, 67, is Asia’s richest man and controls an empire that has businesses ranging from oil and clean energy to telecom and media. Much like Reliance, Adani’s colossal $200 billion conglomerate operates in key industries, including energy and logistics, which are considered indispensable to India’s economic growth. According to Bloomberg, the billionaire is currently the second richest person in Asia, but he briefly ousted Jeff Bezos as the world’s second-wealthiest person in 2022. While investors have been cheering the duo’s ability to bet on sectors prioritized by Modi, critics have said their rise is fuelling crony capitalism in the world’s fastest growing economy. Modi used Adani’s private aircraft while he was campaigning to become prime minister in 2014. Over the years, both the ruling party and the industrialist have denied any suggestion of favoritism. In January 2023, the Adani group was rocked by an unprecedented crisis when an American short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of engaging in fraud over decades. Adani denounced Hindenburg’s report as “baseless” and “malicious.” But that failed to halt a stunning stock market meltdown that, at one point, wiped more than $100 billion off the value of its listed companies. Political leaders from India’s main opposition party ferociously questioned Adani’s relationship with the prime minister, and some even said that they were punished for pursuing the issue.

cnn,How India got stuck in its own unusual time zone,"May 9, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/travel/india-half-hour-time-zone-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html,"Nine hours and 30 minutes ahead of New York. Five hours and 30 minutes ahead of London. Three hours and 30 minutes behind Tokyo. For more than a century, India’s clocks have officially fallen short of the full hour in calculating any time difference it has with most countries. And while it is part of a small group of nations and territories that shares that 30-minute gap - including Iran, Myanmar and parts of Australia - India is perhaps the most unlikely outlier. The huge South Asian nation geographically spans what would normally be two time zones, but much to the frustration of some groups, it clings to its unusual clock settings, refusing to part ways with a system that has a very complicated past. India’s half-hour zone dates back to colonial rule of India and the era when ever-faster steamships and trains were shrinking the world. Until the 19th century, India - like most places around the world - operated on very localized times, which were often different not just from city to city, but from village to village. But playing a key role in the background was East India Company, a ruthless and powerful British-owned trading organization that gradually seized control of large parts of the subcontinent. The East India Company was managing the one of Asia’s first observatories, in Madras (now known as Chennai) by 1792. A decade later, the first official astronomer at this observatory declared Madras time to be “the basis of Indian Standard Time.” It took a few decades, the advent of steam-powered locomotives and the commercial interests of the East India Company to make that stick, though. “The railroads had immense sway over the colonial powers,” says Geoff Gordon, a senior researcher in public international law at the University of Amsterdam. “Before the railroads won the contest for Madras time, there was a contest among the powerful cities – Bombay, Kolkata,” adds Gordon. “That fight didn’t last long.” Meanwhile, similar debates around the world, driven by the need to better coordinate transcontinental rail travel and improve maritime navigation, led to the establishment of the first international time zones at a conference in Washington D.C. in 1884. The zones were based around the Greenwich Meridian, a line of longitude that runs north-south through the Greenwich Observatory in London. Time zones to the east of the Meridian are typically later than Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in hourly increments. It took a while for the system to be adopted globally. In India, people were still arguing over Madras Time. Despite the time’s adoption by the country’s railways, it faced considerable opposition from workers and local communities unwilling to have rigid new timings imposed on them. “There’s less room to maneuver as your working rhythms are linked up no longer with your boss down the street, the church bell, and the 20 other people that you go to work with,” says Gordon. “But it’s now determined by the railroad that arrives once a day.” Eventually, Madras Time was established nationwide by 1905, with only a few remaining holdouts. The start of the 20th century saw some push from scientific associations to calibrate India’s time to GMT. The Royal Society in London proposed two time zones for India, both in full-hour increments from GMT and one another: Six hours ahead of GMT for the east and five hours for the west of the country. That recommendation was rejected by the colonial government, which opted for a unified time that sat squarely in the middle: five and a half hours ahead of GMT. “It strikes me as sort of typical of the colonial mindset,” says Gordon. And so, in 1906, India’s British rulers introduced what is now known as Indian Standard Time. While the 30-minute difference is a lingering remnant of India’s colonial past, some countries have changed their own time zones more recently. Venezuela’s former president Hugo Chávez set clocks back by half an hour in 2007 to give schoolchildren more daylight time, a move that was later reversed by current leader Nicolas Maduro. In 2015, North Korea moved out of sync with South Korea by creating “Pyongyang Time,” putting the country eight and a half hours ahead of GMT instead of nine. India’s colonial-era time zone decision making, however, reflected a chorus of political, scientific and commercial voices both from within the government and outside of it, Gordon says. He compares India during this period to “Brazil,” the 1985 dark dystopian sci-fi fantasy film directed by Terry Gilliam, or the comically complicated contraptions drawn by US cartoonist Rube Goldberg. “It’s just this unbelievably haphazard Rube Goldberg-esque construction, that is built up through lots of different inputs, lots of people acting opportunistically, lots of people acting naively,” he adds. “There was a lot of weirdness and wildness.” India’s single time-zone has been the subject of much debate over the years, with populations in the northeast demanding a separate time zone given how wide the country is. Though this problem isn’t unique to India: geographically, China is the third largest in the world and still only has one time zone, which a 2014 study argues is symbolic of the state’s centralized control over people’s everyday lives. India’s official timekeepers, the National Physical Laboratory, even called for two separate time zones on account of this issue, citing reports of India’s time “badly affecting” the lives of people in the northeast. It proposed two time zones instead: five and a half hours ahead of GMT for one side of India, and six and a half hours for another, specifically what they’ve described as “extreme northeast regions,” including areas like Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. “Despite geographical differences—such as the sun rising and setting nearly two hours earlier in the northeast compared to Gujarat—both regions adhere to the same time-zone,” says Maulik Jagnani, an assistant professor of economics at Tufts University. Jagnani published a widely cited paper in 2019 highlighting the impact of sunlight on natural circadian rhythms in India, with a focus on children. “This setup affects children’s sleep patterns […] children exposed to later sunsets go to bed later,” adds Jagnani. “Fixed school and work start times do not allow for corresponding adjustments in wake-up times, leading to reduced sleep and poorer educational outcomes.” The NPL also recognized this issue, adding that the circadian rhythm’s impact on health and work efficiency, is tied to the “overall socio-economic development of the region.” However, it looks like India’s unusual time zone is here to stay. When the question of introducing two time zones was put to India’s parliament in 2019, a government committee rejected the concept over unspecified “strategic reasons.”",nine hour minute ahead new york five hour minute ahead london three hour minute behind tokyo century india clock officially fallen short full hour calculating time difference country part small group nation territory share minute gap including iran myanmar part australia india perhaps unlikely outlier huge south asian nation geographically span would normally two time zone much frustration group cling unusual clock setting refusing part way system complicated past india halfhour zone date back colonial rule india era everfaster steamship train shrinking world th century india like place around world operated localized time often different city city village village playing key role background east india company ruthless powerful britishowned trading organization gradually seized control large part subcontinent east india company managing one asia first observatory madras known chennai decade later first official astronomer observatory declared madras time basis indian standard time took decade advent steampowered locomotive commercial interest east india company make stick though railroad immense sway colonial power say geoff gordon senior researcher public international law university amsterdam railroad contest madras time contest among powerful city bombay kolkata add gordon fight didnt last long meanwhile similar debate around world driven need better coordinate transcontinental rail travel improve maritime navigation led establishment first international time zone conference washington dc zone based around greenwich meridian line longitude run northsouth greenwich observatory london time zone east meridian typically later greenwich mean time gmt hourly increment took system adopted globally india people still arguing madras time despite time adoption country railway faced considerable opposition worker local community unwilling rigid new timing imposed there le room maneuver working rhythm linked longer bos street church bell people go work say gordon determined railroad arrives day eventually madras time established nationwide remaining holdout start th century saw push scientific association calibrate india time gmt royal society london proposed two time zone india fullhour increment gmt one another six hour ahead gmt east five hour west country recommendation rejected colonial government opted unified time sat squarely middle five half hour ahead gmt strike sort typical colonial mindset say gordon india british ruler introduced known indian standard time minute difference lingering remnant india colonial past country changed time zone recently venezuela former president hugo chvez set clock back half hour give schoolchildren daylight time move later reversed current leader nicolas maduro north korea moved sync south korea creating pyongyang time putting country eight half hour ahead gmt instead nine india colonialera time zone decision making however reflected chorus political scientific commercial voice within government outside gordon say compare india period brazil dark dystopian scifi fantasy film directed terry gilliam comically complicated contraption drawn u cartoonist rube goldberg unbelievably haphazard rube goldbergesque construction built lot different input lot people acting opportunistically lot people acting naively add lot weirdness wildness india single timezone subject much debate year population northeast demanding separate time zone given wide country though problem isnt unique india geographically china third largest world still one time zone study argues symbolic state centralized control people everyday life india official timekeeper national physical laboratory even called two separate time zone account issue citing report india time badly affecting life people northeast proposed two time zone instead five half hour ahead gmt one side india six half hour another specifically theyve described extreme northeast region including area like assam arunachal pradesh despite geographical differencessuch sun rising setting nearly two hour earlier northeast compared gujaratboth region adhere timezone say maulik jagnani assistant professor economics tuft university jagnani published widely cited paper highlighting impact sunlight natural circadian rhythm india focus child setup affect childrens sleep pattern child exposed later sunset go bed later add jagnani fixed school work start time allow corresponding adjustment wakeup time leading reduced sleep poorer educational outcome npl also recognized issue adding circadian rhythm impact health work efficiency tied overall socioeconomic development region however look like india unusual time zone stay question introducing two time zone put india parliament government committee rejected concept unspecified strategic reason,3.0,neutral,0
cnn,Billionaires alone won’t turn Narendra Modi’s India into a rich country,"May 8, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/07/business/india-economy-modi-ambani-adani-influence-intl-hnk/index.html,"In March, a quiet coastal town in the western Indian state of Gujarat could have given both Davos and Coachella a run for their money. That’s when billionaires and movie stars from around the world jetted to Jamnagar, overwhelming its small airport with private planes and chartered flights. They were all there to party with Asia’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani. The 67-year old chairman of India’s most valuable private company Reliance Industries had thrown a lavish pre-wedding bash for his son, welcoming around 1,200 guests from Silicon Valley, Bollywood and beyond. Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump were among the many high-profile celebrities in attendance. The three-day celebration, which saw performances by popstar Rihanna and magician David Blaine, transfixed India and further underscored Ambani’s growing global clout. But Ambani was not the only Indian businessman at the bash whose staggering influence and riches are reshaping the world’s most populous country. Fellow billionaire Gautam Adani, founder of the Adani group, was also invited. The infrastructure tycoon has stunned the world with his supercharged rise in the last decade. In 2022, he briefly ousted Jeff Bezos as the world’s second-wealthiest person. “They are phenomenal … entrepreneurs, who have been able to sustain steady growth and development in a vibrant yet sometimes chaotic political and business environment that exists in India,” said Rohit Lamba, an economist at Pennsylvania State University. Investors have been cheering the duo’s ability to adroitly bet on sectors prioritized for development by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, currently campaigning for his third consecutive term to lead India. The South Asian country is poised to become a 21st-century economic powerhouse, offering a real alternative to China for investors hunting for growth and manufacturers looking to reduce risks in their supply chains. Reliance Industries and the Adani Group are sprawling conglomerates worth over $200 billion each, with established businesses in sectors ranging from fossil fuels and clean energy to media and technology. As a result, these three men — Modi, Ambani and Adani — are playing a fundamental role in shaping the economic superpower India will become in the coming decades. In India’s financial capital Mumbai, the fingerprints of the two businessmen are everywhere, starting from the bustling international airport, which is operated by Adani. Their names are plastered across the city — from the bubble lettering of the Adani Group logo propped up beside highways to high-rise apartment buildings branded with Adani Realty, to cultural institutions named after the Ambani clan. Some spaces need no names or bright labels, but their affiliations are just as obvious. Everyone in Mumbai knows who lives in Antilia — the personal skyscraper of Ambani and his family, which reportedly cost $2 billion to build and boasts a spa, three helipads and a 50-seat theater. The 27-story building sits on a street dubbed “Billionaires’ Row,” its jutting geometric architecture looming over the neighborhood. The kind of power and influence these Indian tycoons enjoy has been seen before in other countries experiencing periods of rapid industrialisation. Both Ambani and Adani are often compared by journalists to John D Rockefeller, who became America’s first billionaire during the Gilded Age, a 30-year period in the last decades of the 19th century. During those decades, industrialists saw their fortunes ascend to staggering heights thanks to the rapid expansion of trains, factories and urban centers across America. Other famous names including Frick, Astor, Carnegie, and Vanderbilt also shaped the country’s infrastructure. More recently in Asia, “chaebols” or giant family-run conglomerates have dominated the South Korean economy for decades and many of them, including Samsung and Hyundai, have become global leaders in semiconductors and autos. “India is in the middle of something that America and lots of other countries have already gone through. Britain in the 1820s, South Korea in the 1960s and 70s, and you could argue China in the 2000s,” said James Crabtree, the author of The Billionaire Raj, a book about India’s wealthy. It is “normal” for developing nations to go through such a period of rapid growth, which sees “income accumulation at the very top, rising inequality and lots of crony capitalism,” he added. The Indian economy has many of those characteristics. Worth $3.7 trillion in 2023, it is the world’s fifth largest economy, jumping four spots in the rankings during Modi’s decade in office and leapfrogging the United Kingdom. It is comfortably placed to expand at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, but analysts say the country should be targeting growth of 8% or more if it wants to become an economic superpower. Sustained expansion will push India higher up the ranks of the world’s biggest economies, with some observers forecasting the South Asian nation to become number three behind only the US and China by 2027. Despite these successes, soaring youth unemployment and inequality remain stubbornly persistent problems. In 2022, the country ranked a lowly 147 on gross domestic product (GDP) per person, a measure of living standards, according to the World Bank. To spur growth, the Modi government has begun a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. It is also heavily promoting digital connectivity, which can improve both commerce and daily life. Both Adani and Ambani have become key allies as the country embarks on this revolution. “These conglomerates are very, very important and very well connected,” said Guido Cozzi, professor of macroeconomics at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland, noting that both the Adani Group and Reliance Industries were founded years before Modi came to power. “They are not typical stagnant monopolistic conglomerates. They are pretty dynamic,” Cozzi said. Not only are they playing “an important role” in building infrastructure, which helps “growth directly,” the two business groups are also helping the country expand “indirectly” by boosting connectivity through digital innovation, he explained. Reliance was founded by Ambani’s father, Dhirubhai, as a small yarn trading firm in Mumbai in 1957. Over the next few decades, it grew into a colossal conglomerate spanning energy, petrochemicals and telecommunications. After his father’s death, and following a bitter feud with his younger brother, Ambani inherited the company’s main oil and petrochemicals assets. He then spent billions transforming it into a tech juggernaut. In less than a decade, Ambani has not only upended India’s telecom sector, but also become a top player in sectors ranging from media to retail. His ambition and breathless pace of expansion is matched by Adani, a college drop-out who now helms businesses ranging from ports and power to defense and aerospace. A first-generation entrepreneur, the 62-year-old began his career with diamond trading, before setting up a commodity trading business in 1988, which later evolved into Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL). According to a January note by American brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, AEL “is at the core of everything India wants to accomplish.” The company functions as an incubator for Adani’s businesses. Many have been spun out and become leading players in their respective sectors. According to Cantor, the firm’s current focus on airports, roads and energy make it “a unique long-term investment opportunity.” And while both the barons built much of their fortune from fossil fuels, they are now investing billions in clean energy. Their green energy pivot comes at a time when India has set itself some ambitious climate goals. The world’s fastest growing major economy has other conglomerates as well. The 156-year-old Tata Group wields immense power over various key sectors ranging from steel to aviation, but it often does not invite the same scrutiny as the newer conglomerates, mainly because it is controlled by philanthropic trusts and not run as a family dynasty. Ambani and Adani are considered vocal champions of Modi. Prominent politicians from opposition parties in India have often questioned Modi’s ties with India’s super-rich, and the meteoric rise of Adani becoming a fraught issue last year. In January 2023, the group was rocked by an unprecedented crisis when an American short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of engaging in fraud over decades. Adani denounced Hindenburg’s report as “baseless” and “malicious.” But that failed to halt a stunning stock market meltdown that, at one point, wiped more than $100 billion off the value of its listed companies. Political leaders from India’s main opposition party ferociously questioned Adani’s relationship with the prime minister, and some even said that they were punished for pursuing the issue. Since then, Adani has made a remarkable comeback, with shares in some of his companies touching record highs. Despite the scandal, the group has also managed to attract billions from new foreign investors, including US private equity firm GQG Partners. “While that report brought to light serious concerns, we believe the company has taken actions to reduce liquidity risk, improve governance, and increase transparency,” Cantor said in its report. “Thus, at this juncture, we believe Adani is too big to ignore, and for India, we believe the country needs Adani as much as Adani needs the country.” Now, as India votes, Modi’s perceived relationship with the billionaires is once again being questioned by rivals. Prasanna Tantri, associate professor of finance at the Indian School of Business, said he does not have “reason to believe that things have become worse than before” when it comes to crony capitalism in India. Some processes, particularly more transparency in allocation of India’s natural resources and the overhauling of the country’s bankruptcy laws, have been important reforms under Modi, he added. Experts say that some amount of closeness between politicians and business elite can help in growing the nation faster. “The optimal level of corruption in an economy is never zero,” said Crabtree, adding that India needs to build more independent institutions that can keep it under control. However, unchecked dominance of such enormous groups may choke competition and innovation, and ultimately lead to stagnation in an economy. The new government needs to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation by making it easier for smaller firms to raise money and getting rid of archaic laws, including land and labor rules, that can get in the way of doing business. Failing to do so, could stifle India’s future growth. A few big conglomerates cannot absorb the million people joining the labor force every month, said Lamba, who is also co-author of Breaking the Mould, a 2023 book that examines how Asia’s third largest economy can grow faster. “India cannot grow rich before it becomes old on the back of a few big firms like Adani or Ambani,” he said. “India should make more firms.”",march quiet coastal town

cnn,Campaign video targeting Muslims faces India police probe as critics accuse Modi’s party of divisive election tactics,"May 8, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/08/india/india-bjp-muslim-video-police-investigation-intl-hnk/index.html,"Police in southern India are investigating a senior leader of the country’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over a political video targeting Muslims, as critics accuse Prime Minister Narendra Modi of running an increasingly divisive re-election campaign. The police probe comes as the world’s most populous nation votes in a mammoth weeks-long election in which Modi’s Hindu-nationalist party is widely expected to secure a rare third consecutive term. The party has long denied being anti-Islam but opposition politicians and prominent Muslims have warned that its leaders have been deploying openly divisive rhetoric to turbo-charge their campaign. According to a police report seen by CNN on Tuesday, Karnataka state police are investigating whether local BJP leader B. Y. Vijayendra and the unnamed holder of the party’s official local X account “promoted enmity” between religious groups after the clip was posted online on May 4. The 17-second animation depicts leaders of India’s main opposition Congress party giving benefits to Muslims, alongside a caption in the local Kannada language: “Beware… Beware… Beware…!” It shows caricatures of Congress’s national leader Rahul Gandhi and its Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah feeding “funds” to a large bird wearing a Muslim skullcap, while giving nothing to three smaller birds portraying other marginalized minorities. The large bird then kicks the other birds out of their nest as the Congress politicians laugh. The video was removed Wednesday after a request to X from India’s Election Commission to take it down. CNN has reached out to Vijayendra, the BJP and X for comment. Critics said Congress’ manifesto makes no mention of redistributing wealth to Muslims, while Congress lawmaker Manickam Tagore said the video was a “blatant demonization of minorities by ruling BJP,” and urged the Election Commission to address its “divisive tactics.” Many of India’s more than 200 million Muslims have expressed fear at the prospect of Modi’s re-election, and critics said the video fits a pattern of openly Islamophobic rhetoric during the BJP’s campaign. Last month, the BJP’s Instagram account published another animation that claimed the Congress planned to prioritize Muslims. “If you are a non-Muslim, Congress will snatch your wealth and distribute it to Muslims,” said a voiceover in the clip, which has since been removed from Instagram. That video echoed similar comments by Modi, who sparked a row over hate speech last month while campaigning in BJP-ruled Rajasthan state, when he accused Muslims – who have been present in India for centuries – of being “infiltrators” who deliberately have large families to outgrow the majority Hindu population. Modi’s speech ignited widespread anger among Muslim leaders and opposition politicians and calls for election authorities to investigate. BJP party spokespeople subsequently said Modi was talking about undocumented migrants. The election commission has asked the BJP to respond to the allegations. In an interview with local broadcaster Times Now on Monday, Modi said the BJP is “not opposed to Islam and Muslims.” But many Muslims were skeptical. “This is not a dogwhistle, this is a targeted, direct, brazen hate speech against a community,” prominent Muslim journalist Rana Ayyub said in response to the speech.",police southern india investigating senior leader country ruling bharatiya janata party bjp political video targeting muslim critic accuse prime minister narendra modi running increasingly divisive reelection campaign police probe come world populous nation vote mammoth weekslong election modis hindunationalist party widely expected secure rare third consecutive term party long denied antiislam opposition politician prominent muslim warned leader deploying openly divisive rhetoric turbocharge campaign according police report seen cnn tuesday karnataka state police investigating whether local bjp leader b vijayendra unnamed holder party official local x account promoted enmity religious group clip posted online may second animation depicts leader india main opposition congress party giving benefit muslim alongside caption local kannada language beware beware beware show caricature congress national leader rahul gandhi karnataka chief minister siddaramaiah feeding fund large bird wearing muslim skullcap giving nothing three smaller bird portraying marginalized minority large bird kick bird nest congress politician laugh video removed wednesday request x india election commission take cnn reached vijayendra bjp x comment critic said congress manifesto make mention redistributing wealth muslim congress lawmaker manickam tagore said video blatant demonization minority ruling bjp urged election commission address divisive tactic many india million muslim expressed fear prospect modis reelection critic said video fit pattern openly islamophobic rhetoric bjps campaign last month bjps instagram account published another animation claimed congress planned prioritize muslim nonmuslim congress snatch wealth distribute muslim said voiceover clip since removed instagram video echoed similar comment modi sparked row hate speech last month campaigning bjpruled rajasthan state accused muslim present india century infiltrator deliberately large family outgrow majority hindu population modis speech ignited widespread anger among muslim leader opposition politician call election authority investigate bjp party spokespeople subsequently said modi talking undocumented migrant election commission asked bjp respond allegation interview local broadcaster time monday modi said bjp opposed islam muslim many muslim skeptical dogwhistle targeted direct brazen hate speech community prominent muslim journalist rana ayyub said response speech,-9.0,negative,2
cnn,‘Bound to secrecy’: The indelible ink behind the world’s biggest election,"May 3, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/india-elections-purple-voter-ink-intl-hnk/index.html,"India’s massive, twice-a-decade exercise in democracy is once again leaving its mark on the country’s people, in the form of purple-streaked index fingers. The Election Commission uses indelible ink, or “voter ink”, to prevent fraud or duplicate votes. Once a voter arrives at the booth to cast their ballot and has their ID verified, the ink is painted across the top of their left index finger, leaving a stain that can take up to two weeks to wash off. It may be rudimentary, but the method has been so effective that it’s been in place for more than seven decades. “Right from the prime minister to the most common person, everybody flashes their (marked) finger,” said K Mohammed Irfan, managing director of Mysore Varnish and Paints Limited (MVPL), the state-owned company that exclusively makes and distributes the liquid to polling booths across the nation. “From celebrities to film stars… (it has become) a mark of democracy that I think is synonymous with elections,” he told CNN in a video interview. More than 960 million people are eligible to vote in India’s election, the world’s biggest. And workers at the company’s factory in Mysuru, a city in southwestern Karnataka state, have spent months preparing nearly 2.7 million ink vials, its largest order to date. The orange containers were filled and carefully packed for distribution ahead of this year’s elections, which are underway and end June 1. Each vial contains enough liquid to mark approximately 700 voters. The key to the ink’s literal staying power? A tightly guarded formula which has remained unchanged since 1951. “Indelible ink serves no other purpose,” said Irfan. “We only manufacture the required quantity.”  While Irfan says the company is “bound to secrecy” when it comes to the ink’s exact composition, it does contain the chemical compound silver nitrate, which causes a purplish stain when it comes into contact with skin and is exposed to sunlight. When newly independent India held its first-ever general elections in 1951 and 1952, organizers turned to the idea of using indelible ink to mark voters, in efforts to ensure a fair ballot. “In a country where there was no systematic registration of births, or identity documents, and with millions of people on the move as refugees, the question of how to prevent impersonation and double voting was a source of great concern,” said Ornit Shani, author of “How India Became Democratic: Citizenship and the Making of the Universal Franchise.” Some officials thought the method would take too much time and complicate the voting process, according to Shani, but public opinion eventually won out. “Combined with the practice that all voters, irrespective of their caste, class and religions would stand in the same line, (having to wait) for their turn to have their finger marked (before they) cast their vote, further contributed to making concrete and visible the core value of the equality of the vote,” Shani said in an email to CNN. “One man, one woman, one vote.” MVPL was founded as a paint supplier in 1937 by the then maharaja or ruler of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, and retains that side of its business. According to Irfan, when the company isn’t producing ink, it’s supplying, among other products, paint for the public transport sector. The ink’s appeal has spilled beyond India’s borders too. The company now supplies indelible ink to more than 35 countries, including to Ghana beginning in the late 1970s. However, Ghana’s election commission recently announced it would phase out the use of indelible ink, opting for biometric verification methods instead. But the use of the ink in India doesn’t appear to be going away any time soon. For Mukulika Banerjee, an associate professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics, the practice of marking a body may not translate well in other cultures, but it works in India due to common cultural practices. “People routinely have their hands decorated with henna, or women have their feet decorated with different colors,” said Banerjee in a phone interview. “I would argue that the marking of the finger (semi-permanently) kind of fits into it in a way that it might not fit in other contexts.” She also pointed to an unintentional effect of marking voters with ink: creating an environment of peer pressure. Banerjee was able to find instances of this during her research on democracy and elections in West Bengal. “First thing on polling day people do is check out each other’s fingers,” she said. “And if your left index finger is not carrying the indelible mark, they’ll look at you and the first thing they’ll say is ‘Why haven’t you voted?’ “You can make excuses, but by the fifth time in the day, if somebody asks you and it gets so annoying, it’s actually easier to go and vote than to not vote.” The peer pressure extends to movie stars and athletes, who are likely to post their ink-stained fingers to their millions of fans on social media. “These guys have begun to hold up (their fingers) and take selfies of having voted and say ‘I’ve voted, have you?’ because they feel they have a civic duty to encourage others to vote as well,” she added. “So it becomes aspirational; then you want to be like your hero and you want to be able to do the same thing.”",india massive twiceadecade exercise democracy leaving mark country people form purplestreaked index finger election commission us indelible ink voter ink prevent fraud duplicate vote voter arrives booth cast ballot id verified ink painted across top left index finger leaving stain take two week wash may rudimentary method effective place seven decade right prime minister common person everybody flash marked finger said k mohammed irfan managing director mysore varnish paint limited mvpl stateowned company exclusively make distributes liquid polling booth across nation celebrity film star become mark democracy think synonymous election told cnn video interview million people eligible vote india election world biggest worker company factory mysuru city southwestern karnataka state spent month preparing nearly million ink vial largest order date orange container filled carefully packed distribution ahead year election underway end june vial contains enough liquid mark approximately voter key ink literal staying power tightly guarded formula remained unchanged since indelible ink serf purpose said irfan manufacture required quantity irfan say company bound secrecy come ink exact composition contain chemical compound silver nitrate cause purplish stain come contact skin exposed sunlight newly independent india held firstever general election organizer turned idea using indelible ink mark voter effort ensure fair ballot country systematic registration birth identity document million people move refugee question prevent impersonation double voting source great concern said ornit shani author india became democratic citizenship making universal franchise official thought method would take much time complicate voting process according shani public opinion eventually combined practice voter irrespective caste class religion would stand line wait turn finger marked cast vote contributed making concrete visible core value equality vote shani said email cnn one man one woman one vote mvpl founded paint supplier maharaja ruler mysore krishna raja wadiyar iv retains side business according irfan company isnt producing ink supplying among product paint public transport sector ink appeal spilled beyond india border company supply indelible ink country including ghana beginning late however ghana election commission recently announced would phase use indelible ink opting biometric verification method instead use ink india doesnt appear going away time soon mukulika banerjee associate professor anthropology london school economics practice marking body may translate well culture work india due common cultural practice people routinely hand decorated henna woman foot decorated different color said banerjee phone interview would argue marking finger semipermanently kind fit way might fit context also pointed unintentional effect marking voter ink creating environment peer pressure banerjee able find instance research democracy election west bengal first thing polling day people check others finger said left index finger carrying indelible mark theyll look first thing theyll say havent voted make excuse fifth time day somebody asks get annoying actually easier go vote vote peer pressure extends movie star athlete likely post inkstained finger million fan social medium guy begun hold finger take selfies voted say ive voted feel civic duty encourage others vote well added becomes aspirational want like hero want able thing,13.0,positive,2
cnn,‘No one is bigger than him’: On the campaign trail with India’s popular yet divisive leader,"May 2, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/01/india/india-narendra-modi-rally-election-intl-hnk/index.html,"The whir of the helicopter shakes the marquee tent’s roof and kicks up a plume of dust that swirls through the thronging crowd, announcing the arrival of the man they’ve all come to see. Chanting his name, waving his party’s flag and quoting his slogans, in many of their eyes he can do no wrong. Narendra Modi, India’s hugely popular but deeply polarizing prime minister, has landed in the battleground state of Uttar Pradesh as he campaigns for a third consecutive term in power. Arrival at the rally in Aligarh, a three-hour drive from New Delhi, was preceded by a cacophony of horn-honking cars, motorcycles, and trucks all muscling their way in and out of traffic with few discernible lanes. Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state of 240 million people, is right in the heart of the nation’s “Hindi belt”, the predominantly Hindi-speaking Indian states where support for Modi and the devotion of his followers is especially strong. Win UP, so they say, and you win India. As the sun glares down on the dusty field in Aligarh and temperatures soar to 38 degrees Celsius (100 Fahrenheit), the crowd don’t seem to mind. “Modi! Modi! Modi!” they chant, as the prime minister speaks about the BrahMos – a nuclear-capable, land-attack cruise missile jointly developed by Russia and India – that will soon be assembled in a local factory. With nearly 970 million eligible voters, India’s ongoing weekslong election – the world’s largest democratic exercise – is seen as critical in shaping the South Asian country’s trajectory over the next five years, with Modi widely expected to win. And here in Uttar Pradesh, a sense of pride is evident among the thousands gathered to hear the prime minister speak. “We feel proud to have such kind of a leader,” says math teacher Pramod Charma. “Whatever he says, he does – that’s why he calls it ‘Modi’s guarantee.’ In politics, he is the biggest star right now. No one can replace him.” In many ways Modi is part of the wider global wave of populist leaders with an authoritarian streak that have amassed a fervent voter base in recent years. Modi projects himself as an outsider from humble origins. Born as the son of a tea seller in a small town in western Gujarat state, he does not fit neatly within the often privately educated, resolutely metropolitan, English-speaking template set by many previous Indian leaders. To his devoted followers, he’s a man who has transformed the lives of ordinary Indians with his welfare and social policies – while cementing India as a key power broker. But to his critics, he’s a divisive leader, whose Hindu nationalist ambitions have given rise to growing religious persecution and Islamophobia, with many of the country’s more than 200 million Muslims fearing his re-election. Just a day before this April 22 rally in Aligarh, Modi sparked a row over hate speech while campaigning in northwestern Rajasthan state when he accused Muslims – who have been present in India for centuries – of being “infiltrators.” He also echoed a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists that Muslims are displacing the country’s majority Hindu population by deliberately having large families. That speech stirred widespread anger and calls for election authorities to investigate the comments. BJP spokespeople subsequently said Modi was talking about undocumented migrants. And Modi’s remarks did little to shake the faith of his devoted followers in Aligarh. Lawyer Gaurav Mahajan says this is the fifth Modi campaign rally he has attended. “(He is the) most powerful leader in the world,” he says. “Indians have faith in Modi.” With just two out of seven phases of voting complete, Indian politics remains unpredictable. But with no one in the opposition camp to possess the kind of brand name and star quality that Modi has, analysts say his re-election is widely expected. Opposition leaders have meanwhile accused Modi’s right-wing government of becoming an electoral autocracy by attempting to rig the vote, weaponizing state agencies to stifle, attack and arrest opposition politicians, and undermining democratic principles. They also warn that Modi’s brand of Hindu nationalism is uncorking dangerous religious divides in a country with a long and tragic history of sectarian bloodletting. The BJP’s national spokesperson has previously said the party is not prejudiced against Muslims and that democracy is protected under the constitution. Modi is expected to remain on the campaign trail until India’s next prime minister is named in early June, traversing the huge country, visiting city after city and delivering his roaring speeches that attract the masses. In Aligarh, the mood feels like a jovial pep rally, and there is none of the divisive rhetoric that was on show in Rajasthan. When the crowd spots our camera, as if on cue, they begin to chant: “Modi! Modi! Modi!” Old and young, the sentiment in the crowd appears universal. “There are no words to express the goodness of Modi,” says engineering student Narayan Pachaury, 17. “No one is bigger than him.”",whir helicopter shake marquee tent roof kick plume dust swirl thronging crowd announcing arrival man theyve come see chanting name waving party flag quoting slogan many eye wrong narendra modi india hugely popular deeply polarizing prime minister landed battleground state uttar pradesh campaign third consecutive term power arrival rally aligarh threehour drive new delhi preceded cacophony hornhonking car motorcycle truck muscling way traffic discernible lane uttar pradesh india populous state million people right heart nation hindi belt predominantly hindispeaking indian state support modi devotion follower especially strong win say win india sun glare dusty field aligarh temperature soar degree celsius fahrenheit crowd dont seem mind modi modi modi chant prime minister speaks brahmos nuclearcapable landattack cruise missile jointly developed russia india soon assembled local factory nearly million eligible voter india ongoing weekslong election world largest democratic exercise seen critical shaping south asian country trajectory next five year modi widely expected win uttar pradesh sense pride evident among thousand gathered hear prime minister speak feel proud kind leader say math teacher pramod charma whatever say thats call modis guarantee politics biggest star right one replace many way modi part wider global wave populist leader authoritarian streak amassed fervent voter base recent year modi project outsider humble origin born son tea seller small town western gujarat state fit neatly within often privately educated resolutely metropolitan englishspeaking template set many previous indian leader devoted follower he man transformed life ordinary indian welfare social policy cementing india key power broker critic he divisive leader whose hindu nationalist ambition given rise growing religious persecution islamophobia many country million muslim fearing reelection day april rally aligarh modi sparked row hate speech campaigning northwestern rajasthan state accused muslim present india century infiltrator also echoed false conspiracy voiced hindu nationalist muslim displacing country majority hindu population deliberately large family speech stirred widespread anger call election authority investigate comment bjp spokespeople subsequently said modi talking undocumented migrant modis remark little shake faith devoted follower aligarh lawyer gaurav mahajan say fifth modi campaign rally attended powerful leader world say indian faith modi two seven phase voting complete indian politics remains unpredictable one opposition camp posse kind brand name star quality modi analyst say reelection widely expected opposition leader meanwhile accused modis rightwing government becoming electoral autocracy attempting rig vote weaponizing state agency stifle attack arrest opposition politician undermining democratic principle also warn modis brand hindu nationalism uncorking dangerous religious divide country long tragic history sectarian bloodletting bjps national spokesperson previously said party prejudiced muslim democracy protected constitution modi expected remain campaign trail india next prime minister named early june traversing huge country visiting city city delivering roaring speech attract mass aligarh mood feel like jovial pep rally none divisive rhetoric show rajasthan crowd spot camera cue begin chant modi modi modi old young sentiment crowd appears universal word express goodness modi say engineering student narayan pachaury one bigger,25.0,positive,0
cnn,Rising Hindu nationalism leaves Muslims fearful in India’s holy city,"May 1, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/30/india/india-elections-varanasi-hindu-muslim-tensions-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,"The sun glistens on the Ganges as Hindu devotees bathe in the holy river’s waters, and the Muslim call to prayer reverberates through the dusty air. Varanasi, an ancient city of temples and gods, is India’s spiritual capital. And here, in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s political stronghold, tensions between the two faiths are escalating. When Modi chose this holy city as his constituency a decade ago, it was the perfect setting for him to meld his party’s political and religious ambitions. Having risen to power on a promise of development and anti-corruption, his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) now stands accused of turning India – a nation constitutionally bound to secularism – into a Hindu rashtra, or homeland. As Sana Sabah celebrated the Muslim festival of Eid with her family in Varanasi, she raised these fears with trepidation in her voice. “It’s scary that someone like Modi … is not only celebrated but validated,” the 33-year-old entrepreneur said. The Hindu-nationalist right wing, she said, “is not even trying to hide it anymore. And it’s troublesome.” With voting now underway in the world’s most populous nation, a significant portion of its more than 200 million strong Muslim population express fear at the prospect of Modi’s re-election. Vying for a rare third term in power, he is defending his seat in the traffic-clogged, diverse city of some 1.7 million people. Yet, 10 years after his ascension, many of Varanasi’s Muslims feel neglected, even betrayed, especially now as a centuries old-mosque becomes the latest flashpoint in a case that tests India’s secular fabric. Local Muslim leader Syed Mohammad Yaseen, 78, feels the government is failing to protect his community, which he says is feeling increasingly vulnerable and fearful of hate crimes in today’s India. “The worst will happen (if Modi gets reelected),” he said from his office in Varanasi. “We are tolerating these things, maybe one day there can be change. But we are hopeless.” Modi’s BJP has its roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing paramilitary organization that advocates Hindu supremacy within India – though the party has repeatedly said it does not discriminate against minorities. “There is not one welfare scheme where religion, or community, is used as a base to discriminate,” said BJP Varanasi leader Dileep Patel, referring to the government’s welfare programs. “The prime minister’s schemes (programs) apply to our Muslim brothers, Hindu brothers, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, and Parsis, who have, without any discrimination, benefited from Modi.” There is no doubt that Modi’s decade in power has been transformative. India has arrived on the world stage, inching ever closer to global-power status, boasting the fastest-growing major economy, and making great strides in technology and space. But there is also no doubt that religious polarization has increased. Hindu nationalists have been appointed to top positions in key government institutions, giving them the power to make sweeping changes to legislation that rights groups say unfairly target Muslims. Textbooks have been rewritten to downplay the history of India’s ancient Islamic rulers, cities and streets with Mughal-era names renamed and Muslim properties have been demolished by authorities for illegal encroachment on government land and as punishment for alleged rioting. In 2019, Modi removed the special autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir – India’s only Muslim-majority state – bringing it under the direct control of New Delhi. That same year, his administration passed a controversial citizenship law that excludes Muslim migrants, giving rise to deadly riots. Nasir Ali recalls the evening, weeks after the law’s enactment, when right-wing Hindu mobs gathered near his home in New Delhi, chanting anti-Islam slogans, attacking property and harassing residents. He was bringing his sister home from a hospital in a taxi. He felt safe, he said, because “this was the capital, Delhi, and it was daytime.” But as his taxi approached the streets, Ali saw the mob. “Among them, there was a man who took out his pistol and fired at me. He started chanting ‘Jai Shree Sri Ram’ (a Hindu religious slogan) and ran away,” says Ali. Ali says he believes he was shot because of his Muslim faith, and said it was a neighbor who pulled the trigger. He attempted to file a police complaint at his local station against the alleged perpetrators, a 2021 Delhi court order seen by CNN shows. But the police did not register his complaint, nor properly investigate, the court order said. The local Bhajanpura Police have since disputed those findings, and the case is winding its way through the legal system, with the next hearing expected in September, according to Ali’s lawyer. CNN has contacted Bhajanpura Police for comment. The riots were described as some of the worst sectarian violence in decades, leaving dozens, mostly Muslims, dead. Delhi police made about 800 arrests, according to a report shared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Ali, who was blinded in one eye, now says he is wary of letting his fellow citizens know he is Muslim. “We do not let anyone realize (our religion),” he said. “We hide our names as well.” Moments of large-scale violence like those Delhi riots often make national or international headlines. But it is the day-to-day incidents which spring up all over India that many say characterizes the way life has changed for so many of India’s Muslims under Modi. When Usman, 28, moved from Kashmir to northwestern Rajasthan state for work in 2021, he said he struggled to find a home for weeks, visiting broker after broker in the city of Jaipur, who looked at his name and had one remark: “This is going to be a problem.” “It’s a given, a Muslim will face a struggle finding an apartment,” said Usman, who asked CNN to use only his first name, citing privacy concerns. “Things were bad before. Now, it’s become worse.” CNN has verified dozens of social media videos that paint a stark picture of religious divisions. In one from March this year, a policeman can be seen kicking Muslims offering prayers on the side of the road in New Delhi. In another from the western state of Gujarat last year, right-wing groups projected “Jai Shree Ram” on the walls of a mosque. In an incident that shocked the nation in August, a railway police officer opened fire on a moving train, killing three Muslim passengers and a Hindu constable, while allegedly advocating for Modi’s leadership. Anti-Muslim speech has also risen dramatically, a recent report by the Washington-based research group India Hate Lab showed, which documented 668 such cases in 2023. BJP politician T. Raja Singh openly called for violence against Muslims in an October speech in Rajasthan, proclaiming: “If they (Muslims) take one Hindu girl, we’ll take 10 of theirs.” At another event, he allegedly said: “You (Muslims) are half cut (circumcised), we will cut you fully.” India prohibits hate speech under several sections of its penal code, including a section that criminalizes “deliberate and malicious acts” intended to insult religious beliefs. Singh is facing a slew of police investigations, including for his alleged hate speeches, but in October last year he was fielded as a BJP candidate in state elections – winning his seat for the third time in a row. CNN has contacted Singh for a response. Analysts say the lack of repercussions for vitriolic comments has given extremists tacit support, making them even more brazen. Many Muslims fear this rise poses a danger to their communities – and worry it may only get worse as India votes in this election. Multiple human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the International Federation for Human Rights have warned of continued discrimination against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, over the past decade, and have repeatedly called on authorities to end it. BJP National Spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill has said his party is not prejudiced against Muslims, and the community has benefited from Modi’s leadership. “India’s constitution protects the Indian democracy. No political party in country is strong enough to bulldoze the Constitution, to bulldoze the will of the people,” he said. Yet, critics have pointed to the lack of representation within the BJP. Despite being a party that claims to represent all Indians it doesn’t have a single Muslim lawmaker. This week, Modi himself sparked a row over hate speech while campaigning in Rajasthan, a BJP ruled-state, when he accused Muslims – who have been present in India for centuries – of being “infiltrators,” and echoing a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists that Muslims are displacing the country’s Hindu population by deliberately having large families. The speech caused widespread anger among Muslims leaders and opposition politicians as well as calls for election authorities to investigate the comments. BJP party spokespeople subsequently said Modi was talking about undocumented migrants. Shamsher Ali, a shopkeeper in Varanasi, fears for his two young daughters growing up in an increasingly polarized India. Ali looks back at his childhood – a time when, he says, Muslim-Hindu camaraderie was the norm. Muslims haven’t felt this level of fear in years, Ali says. “So much hate has been sown that people now look at each other with suspicion … the tensions have become so bad that a Hindu and a Muslim can’t even see eye to eye,” the 45-year-old said. “This government is relying on driving a wedge between the two communities.” Meters from Ali’s shop, the Gyanvapi Mosque has become the latest battleground between Hindu nationalists and Varanasi’s Muslims. The mosque was built in the 17th century by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. It is widely believed a temple devoted to Lord Shiva on the same site was destroyed to make way for it. A different Hindu temple was subsequently built nearby in 1780 and for centuries, Hindus and Muslims prayed at their respective sites side by side, the temple’s gold stripes standing alongside the mosque’s white domes. “Muslim women would wear their niqab (Muslim traditional dress) and Muslim men with their skullcaps would frequent the Ghats nearby (a holy Hindu area),” Ali recalled. But now, the Gyanvapi Mosque sits at the apex of a wider legal campaign to reclaim places of worship, and Hindu nationalists are demanding it back. Its fate is being debated across courtrooms in India, in a case that will have ramifications nationwide. In May 2022, a court survey claimed to find an artifact that resembled a Hindu relic inside the building. Muslims question the conclusion of the survey, saying it runs counter to their own findings. In January, a Varanasi court ruled that Hindus could offer prayer in the basement of the mosque. “Today, the police is against us. I don’t have faith in the judiciary,” said Yaseen, the local Muslim leader, from his office filled with documents related to the case. “They are giving judgment, but not justice.” Outside the temple gates, guards patrol the area. Monkeys scale the walls of the complex, unconcerned by the high security and barbed-wire fence that fortifies the mosque. On the streets, vendors sell marigold flowers, and saffron flags fly high on shops and buildings. The incident has echoes of another major flashpoint – the 16th century Babri mosque in Ayodhya. It was demolished by Hindu hardliners in a 1992 attack, sparking deadly riots, in an incident that helped turbocharge the BJP from a fringe party to a major player. Earlier this year, Modi inaugurated a vast Hindu temple on the site, the culmination of a decades-long campaign and an event seen as a seminal moment by India’s leader – one, critics say, pulled the country away from its constitutionally secular foundations. “(Today) is the beginning of a new time cycle,” Modi said at the new temple. “After centuries of waiting, our Ram has arrived.” Dressed in a saffron robe with religious beads draped around his neck, Hindu priest Swami Jitendranand Saraswati doesn’t think fears harbored by Muslims are substantiated. “If they are saying they feel like they are second-class citizens, then this makes me happy,” he said with a smile, as worshippers touched his feet while bringing offerings to his small temple. He believes Gyanvapi is not a mosque, but a Hindu temple, and wants to see his community worship inside the walls of the building. Swami Saraswati also wants his community to reclaim some 3,000 more Hindu places of worship allegedly destroyed by Mughals centuries ago. “The Hindu community wants its lost self-respect back. The Hindu community wants its places of worship back,” he said. Amit Pandey, the general secretary of the BJP’s youth wing in Varanasi, says India is a Hindu nation, and claims that all the country’s Muslims “were forcibly converted and made slaves by changing their religion” from Hinduism centuries ago. Mainstream historians paint a much more complicated picture, where the South Asian subcontinent experienced waves of migration, invasion, colonialism, trading, conversion and assimilation over the centuries that created the multifaith giant of today’s India. But not all Hindus are supporters of a Hindu nationalist narrative. Vishwambhar Nath Mishra, the priest of a prominent Hindu temple in Varanasi, believes Modi’s stoking of religious tensions is ruining the fabric of Indian society. Varanasi, he noted, is a spiritual center, home to all faiths. “All practices are allowed, and they help each other grow,” Mishra said, standing outside his temple near the banks of the Ganges. “Christianity, Muslims, Buddhism, Hinduism … they live here in a good harmony. And if we have any differences, we sit across the platform and we discuss the issues. This unique fabric has a strained condition now. We have a fear that this fabric may break.” The sentiment is echoed by Ali in his Varanasi shop, where he fears for his community’s survival. “Muslims have anyway become untouchables in this government,” he said. “People say leave the country, but we say we were born here. We will be buried in the soil of this land. This is my country.” Read more from CNN’s India election coverage: Billions spent, jungle-trekking poll workers and voting at 15,000 feet.

cnn,Sari shops and street food stalls: How e-payments have taken over India,"Apr 30, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/29/tech/india-digital-payments-upi-growth-hnk-intl/index.html,"Indian weddings are notoriously elaborate affairs, requiring a multitude of outfit changes for multiple days of festivities. It used to be normal for a family visiting Brij Kishore Agarwal’s sari shop, near the narrow lanes of Chandni Chowk market in India’s Old Delhi, to depart with a big bundle of bright, embroidered garments and leave behind a substantial pile of cash. Worries that someone would break in and steal the money before he could make a bank deposit kept the store’s now-79-year-old owner awake at night. These days he sleeps easier, because almost all his customers use e-payments to complete their purchases. “I have seen this country change,” says Agarwal, who has worked in the shop for about 65 years. “We very rarely get cash payments.” Digital payments, made through systems like the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which allow users to transfer funds instantly by scanning a QR code, have become ubiquitous across the world’s most populous country, transforming daily life. In Delhi, tea sellers collect rupees via mobile apps, and tuk tuk drivers who pull over to buy parathas stuffed with steaming hot paneer pay with their phones. The e-payment revolution is also likely to play an important role in India’s attempts to become an economic superpower. It is the planet’s fifth biggest economy, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is currently running for his third consecutive term, has said he wants India to be considered “developed” by 2047. “Digital payments are likely to enhance India’s growth by eliminating frictions, increasing efficiency, and reducing costs,” Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, told CNN. “UPI and the broader digitization of the economy could also increase the inclusiveness of this growth,” he added. India’s push to digitize its society started about 15 years ago, but e-payments were slow to catch on. In 2016, 96% of transactions in India were still conducted with banknotes. Two events that year changed things. First, the non-profit National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an initiative of the central bank and a banking association, launched the payment infrastructure UPI. UPI allows users to use their phone as a virtual debit card, transferring money from almost 600 member banks and fintech companies instantly without entering bank details or paying transaction fees. Later that year, the government suddenly scrapped two large banknotes that comprised 86% of all currency in circulation, with the stated goal of fighting corruption. That prompted a surge in the use of e-payments. “We had no choice,” says Ramesh Kumar, 52, a towel shop owner in Delhi’s Sarojini Nagar Market, who started accepting digital payments in 2016. Covid-19 further boosted the adoption of digital transactions, as people tried to protect themselves from the virus. Now, Indians use UPI to pay everyone from vegetable vendors to doctors. More digital transactions are completed in India than any other country, according to the government. In 2023, the number of UPI transactions topped 100 billion. There are some holdouts. Azeez, a 34-year-old rickshaw driver in Old Delhi, told CNN that he’s too scared of losing money to use e-payments. “I am [an] uneducated person, I am poor, I have never been to a school, I can’t read or write,” he says. “What if I make a mistake?” Still, the upward trend is expected to continue, further boosting the number and value of funds flowing into the formal economy. UPI is aiming for two billion transactions a day by 2030. “If I can, and my store, which is so old, can move forward and change like this, I am sure every buyer and customer will also do it,” says Agarwal, the sari seller. India is the world’s fastest-growing major economy and digitization “has played a fairly consequential role in the very successful economic trajectory that India is on,” says Prasad, who is the author of “The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution Is Transforming Currencies and Finance.” Although it’s difficult to quantify the impact that UPI adoption has had on India’s gross domestic product, on a micro level it’s easy to see how it’s making a difference. Agarwal says it has increased efficiency and transparency for his business, and made filing taxes simpler. Kapil Sharma, 42, who sells flowers for as little as $0.12 outside a temple in Old Delhi, told CNN he used to lose business because potential customers wouldn’t want to wait for change. He started using UPI about a year ago and has seen an uptick in sales. “It’s just simpler,” he says. “They buy, pay and go.” Convenience aside, India’s digital public infrastructure has helped it achieve an 80% financial inclusion rate. Although inequality remains a problem, Prasad says that digitization has “made Indian citizens, including the masses who are not very wealthy, feel that they have a stake in India’s economic growth and transformation.” Now NPCI is focused on expanding overseas to make it easier for citizens working abroad to send remittances home or allow Indian travellers to pay using UPI. This year, the Eiffel Tower’s website started accepting payment via UPI. “I think the government sees the UPI as a template for the rest of the world,” says Prasad. “I think it would certainly help India’s stature on the world stage.” No matter its future impact outside India, UPI appears to have strong grassroots support from those who have already benefitted from it, which means its dominance in the South Asian nation is likely to grow. “If anyone gives me an option to go back to cash payment, I will just say I am not interested,” says Agarwal. “Please find a phone, download these apps, and use them.”",indian wedding notoriously elaborate affair requiring multitude outfit change multiple day festivity used normal family visiting brij kishore agarwals sari shop near narrow lane chandni chowk market india old delhi depart big bundle bright embroidered garment leave behind substantial pile cash worry someone would break steal money could make bank deposit kept store nowyearold owner awake night day sleep easier almost customer use epayments complete purchase seen country change say agarwal worked shop year rarely get cash payment digital payment made system like unified payment interface upi allow user transfer fund instantly scanning qr code become ubiquitous across world populous country transforming daily life delhi tea seller collect rupee via mobile apps tuk tuk driver pull buy parathas stuffed steaming hot paneer pay phone epayment revolution also likely play important role india attempt become economic superpower planet fifth biggest economy prime minister narendra modi currently running third consecutive term said want india considered developed digital payment likely enhance india growth eliminating friction increasing efficiency reducing cost eswar prasad economics professor cornell university told cnn upi broader digitization economy could also increase inclusiveness growth added india push digitize society started year ago epayments slow catch transaction india still conducted banknote two event year changed thing first nonprofit national payment corporation india npci initiative central bank banking association launched payment infrastructure upi upi allows user use phone virtual debit card transferring money almost member bank fintech company instantly without entering bank detail paying transaction fee later year government suddenly scrapped two large banknote comprised currency circulation stated goal fighting corruption prompted surge use epayments choice say ramesh kumar towel shop owner delhi sarojini nagar market started accepting digital payment covid boosted adoption digital transaction people tried protect virus indian use upi pay everyone vegetable vendor doctor digital transaction completed india country according government number upi transaction topped billion holdout azeez yearold rickshaw driver old delhi told cnn he scared losing money use epayments uneducated person poor never school cant read write say make mistake still upward trend expected continue boosting number value fund flowing formal economy upi aiming two billion transaction day store old move forward change like sure every buyer customer also say agarwal sari seller india world fastestgrowing major economy digitization played fairly consequential role successful economic trajectory india say prasad author future money digital revolution transforming currency finance although difficult quantify impact upi adoption india gross domestic product micro level easy see making difference agarwal say increased efficiency transparency business made filing tax simpler kapil sharma sell flower little outside temple old delhi told cnn used lose business potential customer wouldnt want wait change started using upi year ago seen uptick sale simpler say buy pay go convenience aside india digital public infrastructure helped achieve financial inclusion rate although inequality remains problem prasad say digitization made indian citizen including mass wealthy feel stake india economic growth transformation npci focused expanding overseas make easier citizen working abroad send remittance home allow indian traveller pay using upi year eiffel tower website started accepting payment via upi think government see upi template rest world say prasad think would certainly help india stature world stage matter future impact outside india upi appears strong grassroots support already benefitted mean dominance south asian nation likely grow anyone give option go back cash payment say interested say agarwal please find phone download apps use,21.0,positive,0
cnn,A coal billionaire is building the world’s biggest clean energy plant and it’s five times the size of Paris,"Apr 27, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/19/business/india-adani-green-energy-plant-climate-intl-hnk/index.html,"Five times the size of Paris. Visible from space. The world’s biggest energy plant. Enough electricity to power Switzerland. The scale of the project transforming swathes of barren salt desert on the edge of western India into one of the most important sources of clean energy anywhere on the planet is so overwhelming that the man in charge can’t keep up. “I don’t even do the math any more,” Sagar Adani told CNN in an interview last week. Adani is executive director of Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL). He’s also the nephew of Gautam Adani, Asia’s second richest man, whose $100 billion fortune stems from the Adani Group, India’s biggest coal importer and a leading miner of the dirty fuel. Founded in 1988, the conglomerate has businesses in fields ranging from ports and thermal power plants to media and cements. Its clean energy unit AGEL is building the sprawling solar and wind power plant in the western Indian state of Gujarat at a cost of about $20 billion. It will be the world’s biggest renewable park when it is finished in about five years, and should generate enough clean electricity to power 16 million Indian homes. The success of the Khavda Renewable Energy Park is critical to India’s efforts to reduce pollution and hit its climate goals while meeting the burgeoning energy needs of the world’s most populous nation and fastest-growing major economy. Coal still accounts for 70% of the electricity India generates. Situated just 12 miles from one of the world’s most dangerous borders separating India and Pakistan, the park will cover more than 200 square miles and be the planet’s largest power plant regardless of the energy source, AGEL said. “A region so large, a region that is so unencumbered, there’s no wildlife, there’s no vegetation, there’s no habitation. There is no better alternative use of that land,” said Adani. The group’s big green plans haven’t been dented by the turbulent year it has had since January 2023, when an American short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of engaging in fraud over decades. The Indian mining-to-media conglomerate denounced Hindenburg’s report as “baseless” and “malicious.” But that failed to halt a stunning stock market meltdown that, at one point, wiped more than $100 billion off the value of its listed companies. Gautam Adani’s personal fortune was also hammered, collapsing by more than $80 billion in the month following the release of the report. But the tycoon has since bounced back and the group is now pouring billions into the clean energy sector. It plans to invest $100 billion into energy transition over the next decade, with 70% of the investments ear-marked for clean energy. Adani Group’s clean energy pivot comes at a time when India has set itself some ambitious climate goals. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised that renewable sources such as solar and wind power will fulfil 50% of India’s energy requirements by the end of this decade. In 2021, Modi pledged India would achieve net zero emissions by 2070, which is still a couple of decades later than developed economies. The government has set a target of 500 gigawatts (GW) of non-fossil fuel electricity generating capacity by 2030. AGEL, the country’s largest renewable energy company, aims to provide at least 9% of that, with nearly 30 GW generated from its Khavda park in Gujarat alone. Failing to transition to renewable energy is not an option, said Adani. “There is no choice for India but to start doing things at a previously unimagined size and scale,” the 30-year-old said. That’s because energy demand is going to explode in the coming years. India is the world’s third-largest energy consuming country, although its energy use and emissions per person are less than half the world average, data from the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) shows. That could change rapidly. Thanks to rising incomes, energy demand has doubled since 2000, with 80% of it still being met by coal, oil and solid biomass. Over the next three decades, the rapidly-expanding economy will see the largest energy demand growth of any country in the world, the IEA said. “If India does what China did, if India does what Europe did, if India does what the US did, then we are all in for a very, very bleak climatic future,” said Adani, referring to the historic use of fossil fuels as those countries developed. His dire predictions are not dramatic. India is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, analysts say, and may become the world’s third largest economy before the end of this decade. As it develops and modernizes, its urban population will shoot up, leading to a massive rise in the construction of homes, offices, shops and other buildings. According to analysts, India is set to add the equivalent of a London to its urban population every year for the next 30 years. Electricity demand is expected to skyrocket in the coming years because of factors ranging from improved living standards to climate change. The latter has been fueling deadly heatwaves across India, and as a result, air conditioner ownership is set to see a sharp spike in the coming years. By 2050, India’s total electricity demand from residential air conditioners is set to exceed the total energy consumption in the whole of Africa today, the IEA said. India cannot rely on fossil fuels for its burgeoning needs without disastrous consequences for efforts to tackle the climate crisis. “If you imagine 800 GW of coal-fired thermal capacity being added … this by itself will kill all other sustainable energy initiatives happening all across the world, in terms of carbon emissions,” said Adani. The conglomerate’s green plans are impressive, but climate experts are critical of its continued massive investments in fossil fuels. “[Gautam] Adani continues to walk both sides of the street,” said Tim Buckley, director of Sydney-based think tank Climate Energy Finance. The Adani Group is not only one of the largest developers and operators of coal mines in India, but also operates the controversial Carmichael Coal Mine in Australia, which has faced fierce opposition from climate change campaigners who say it is a “death sentence” for the Great Barrier Reef. “Rather than ploughing billions into new fossil fuel projects, India would be far better served if Adani put 100% of its efforts and resources into developing low-cost zero emissions technologies,” Buckley added. That is not an option at the moment, said Adani. More than 600 million people in India will be “coming into middle income and upper income over the next decade, decade and a half,” he said. “They cannot be deprived of basic needs of energy. ” Everyone would be happy if we could “have a 100% of that being provided from sustainable energy sources …[but]… practically, that’s not an option” at the moment, he added. He also said that activists in developed nations, which have historically emitted more greenhouse gases, are often unable to understand the staggering challenge facing India to grow its economy and its clean energy industry at the same time. “I think it’s also very important to respect the fact that every country has its own right to make sure that the people of their own country are well-served from an energy perspective,” Adani said. “So is India doing a bit of coal? Yes, of course India is. But is India doing a massive amount of renewables? Yes, there’s no question,” he added",five time size paris visible space world biggest energy plant enough electricity power switzerland scale project transforming swathe barren salt desert edge

cnn,Indian voters battle extreme temperatures as intense heat wave hits region,"Apr 26, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/25/india/india-election-heat-wave-climate-intl-hnk/index.html,"Indian voters are battling sweltering conditions to take part in the world’s biggest election as a severe heat wave hits parts of the country and authorities forecast a hotter-than-normal summer for the South Asian nation. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said a heat wave will affect parts of south and east India until the end of the week, including four states that are voting on Friday. Parts of West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka are among 13 states and union territories voting in the second phase of India’s mammoth elections, with temperatures forecast to exceed 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas. On Thursday, Baripada in the eastern state of Odisha hit 43.6 C (110.4 F) and Telangana’s Khammam in the south reached 43.4 C (110.1 F), according to the IMD, which warned last month that India would likely see stronger and longer heat waves this year due to above-normal temperatures. Gandhi Ray, a farmer in his 60s from eastern Bihar state, said he lives in a small hut in the forest, and will walk to a nearby village to vote. Temperatures above 41 C (105 F) are forecast every day until May 1 in his hometown of Banka district, according to the IMD. “It’s important for me to vote but definitely every day this heat is getting worse and worse,” he told CNN. “I work outdoors mostly so I am used to it but as I get older it becomes harder to cope. Now my kids have taken over most of the work.” High temperatures have raised concern this election cycle, as campaigns marked by outdoor political rallies draw thousands of people under the baking sun. The issue was underscored Wednesday, when one lawmaker collapsed from the heat while addressing supporters in western Maharashtra state. The Election Commission, National Disaster Management Authority and IMD formed a task force to minimize the impact of heat waves ahead of polling days and Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting earlier this month to review the country’s preparedness for the hot season. The Election Commission has released guidelines for staying cool at polling stations, including drinking water and carrying an umbrella, and warned against leaving children or pets in parked cars. And in Bihar, election officials have extended voting hours at some polling stations “in view (of the) prevailing heat wave.” Ray said the heat isn’t going to stop him from voting on Friday. “This is the one right we have so of course I will vote, everyone should vote for whomever they want to represent them,” he said. “Of course it would be good if the election took place in a cooler time but whether I go to vote or not, I am still going to feel hot so that’s not going to stop me.” Despite the heat warnings, the Election Commision said there are “no major concerns for heat waves” during Friday’s polling and weather forecasts indicate “normal conditions” for the constituencies voting. India, the world’s most populous nation with 1.4 billion people, often experiences heat waves during the summer months of May and June. But in recent years, they have arrived earlier and become more prolonged, with scientists linking some of these longer and more intense heat waves to the climate crisis. In 2022, a heat wave that killed 90 people across India and Pakistan was made 30 times more likely because of climate change, the World Weather Attribution initiative found. Last year successive heat waves hit India again, closing schools, damaging crops and putting pressure on energy supplies. In June alone, temperatures in some parts of the country soared to 47 C (116 F), killing at least 44 people and sickening hundreds with heat-related illnesses. The human-caused climate crisis is already threatening India’s development goals and putting millions of people at risk in a nation where more than 50% of the workforce is employed in agriculture, studies have found. By 2050, India will be among the places where temperatures have passed survivability limits, according to climate experts. But analysts say climate has not featured as a major issue this election, despite being mentioned in the election manifestos of the two main parties — the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indian National Congress. “Climate impacts do shape voter demands — though this tends to filter through as anxieties about livelihood and continued welfare support, rather than in a neatly defined area of politics labeled ‘climate’,” said Aditya Valiathan Pillai, fellow and coordinator for adaptation and resilience at the New Delhi-based Sustainable Futures Collaborative, in a recent op-ed for CNN. “You can see it in farmers asking for loan waivers and irrigation facilities after years of drought, in urban families demanding reduced electricity prices to offset cooling bills and in calls for more penetrating social welfare.” Extreme heat has already had an impact across the region this year with little respite from merciless heat and humidity for hundreds of millions of people living in areas most vulnerable to climate change. Neighboring Bangladesh is sweltering through a heat wave this week with prolonged temperatures above 40 C in many districts and no relief during record hot nights, according to climatologist Maximiliano Herrera. The government declared a “heat alert” across the country on Thursday, in place for 72 hours. Extreme temperatures are also soaring across Southeast Asia, with dozens of heatstroke deaths report by local media in Thailand, hundreds of schools closed in the Philippines, and droughts drying up rice fields and rivers in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta “rice bowl” region. The weeks-long heat wave in Vietnam has forced three provinces to declare a state of emergency as salt seeps into fresh water sources, limiting access to drinking water for more than 70,000 households, according to Save the Children. A report released Tuesday by the World Meteorological Organization found that Asia remained the world’s most disaster-affected region in 2023 and the region is heating up faster than the global average.",indian voter battling sweltering condition take part world biggest election severe heat wave hit part country authority forecast hotterthannormal summer south asian nation india meteorological department imd said heat wave affect part south east india end week including four state voting friday part west bengal bihar uttar pradesh karnataka among state union territory voting second phase india mammoth election temperature forecast exceed degree celsius degree fahrenheit area thursday baripada eastern state odisha hit c f telanganas khammam south reached c f according imd warned last month india would likely see stronger longer heat wave year due abovenormal temperature gandhi ray farmer eastern bihar state said life small hut forest walk nearby village vote temperature c f forecast every day may hometown banka district according imd important vote definitely every day heat getting worse worse told cnn work outdoors mostly used get older becomes harder cope kid taken work high temperature raised concern election cycle campaign marked outdoor political rally draw thousand people baking sun issue underscored wednesday one lawmaker collapsed heat addressing supporter western maharashtra state election commission national disaster management authority imd formed task force minimize impact heat wave ahead polling day prime minister narendra modi chaired meeting earlier month review country preparedness hot season election commission released guideline staying cool polling station including drinking water carrying umbrella warned leaving child pet parked car bihar election official extended voting hour polling station view prevailing heat wave ray said heat isnt going stop voting friday one right course vote everyone vote whomever want represent said course would good election took place cooler time whether go vote still going feel hot thats going stop despite heat warning election commision said major concern heat wave friday polling weather forecast indicate normal condition constituency voting india world populous nation billion people often experience heat wave summer month may june recent year arrived earlier become prolonged scientist linking longer intense heat wave climate crisis heat wave killed people across india pakistan made time likely climate change world weather attribution initiative found last year successive heat wave hit india closing school damaging crop putting pressure energy supply june alone temperature part country soared c f killing least people sickening hundred heatrelated illness humancaused climate crisis already threatening india development goal putting million people risk nation workforce employed agriculture study found india among place temperature passed survivability limit according climate expert analyst say climate featured major issue election despite mentioned election manifesto two main party ruling bharatiya janata party bjp indian national congress climate impact shape voter demand though tends filter anxiety livelihood continued welfare support rather neatly defined area politics labeled climate said aditya valiathan pillai fellow coordinator adaptation resilience new delhibased sustainable future collaborative recent oped cnn see farmer asking loan waiver irrigation facility year drought urban family demanding reduced electricity price offset cooling bill call penetrating social welfare extreme heat already impact across region year little respite merciless heat humidity hundred million people living area vulnerable climate change neighboring bangladesh sweltering heat wave week prolonged temperature c many district relief record hot night according climatologist maximiliano herrera government declared heat alert across country thursday place hour extreme temperature also soaring across southeast asia dozen heatstroke death report local medium thailand hundred school closed philippine drought drying rice field river vietnam mekong delta rice bowl region weekslong heat wave vietnam forced three province declare state emergency salt seeps fresh water source limiting access drinking water household according save child report released tuesday world meteorological organization found asia remained world disasteraffected region region heating faster global average,-38.0,negative,2
cnn,‘Cabs to get into space’: How this Indian startup wants to revolutionize satellite space travel,"Apr 25, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/23/business/india-space-startups-skyroot-aerospace-hnk-intl/index.html,"India is one of the world’s top spacefaring nations. It is the first Asian country to reach Mars orbit, and the fourth on the planet to take a spacecraft to the moon, landing closer to the south pole, known for its cratered terrain, than anyone else had at the time. But its private sector has played a limited role in space exploration, acting mostly as suppliers and vendors for its national space agency, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). That’s changing quickly, owing to a raft of government reforms aiming to boost private participation in the space sector. In the United States, the proliferation of private companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX have boosted Washington’s space ambitions by driving down costs. Now Indian homegrown startups like Skyroot Aerospace, which launched the country’s first private rocket in 2022, are leading the charge to commercialize India’s space sector and bolster its status as a space superpower. Inside a sleek rocket hanger in the southern city of Hyderabad, the company is preparing for lift-off of the seven-story tall Vikram-1 rocket, which will take India’s first privately launched satellites into orbit. “That’ll be a major milestone for us,” Pawan Chandana, a former ISRO scientist who co-founded Skyroot Aerospace in 2018, told CNN. “Very few companies globally are able to make it to orbit yet.” India is pushing pioneering national initiatives, including plans to have its own space station by 2035 and to put an Indian astronaut on the moon by 2040. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is currently running for his third consecutive term, has made a major push to commercialize space activity in recent years, including allowing private enterprise to take part and easing approvals for foreign investment into the space sector. Companies around the world are catapulting thousands of satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO), which extends to an altitude of about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles), to form mega-constellations: groups of small satellites that work together to beam broadband Internet to terrestrial users. According to analytics firm BryceTech, 96% of spacecraft launched in 2022 were small satellites, up from 61% in 2013. That’s driving exponential growth. The global space economy was worth $630 billion in 2023, according to a report by McKinsey & Company and the World Economic Forum, and it could grow to $1.8 trillion by 2035. It’s the small satellite market that Skyroot wants to capture, with plans to offer customized launches for satellites under 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds). Organizations’ satellites often piggyback onto “rideshare” missions. Last year, for example, one SpaceX journey — powered by its Falcon 9 rocket, which can carry 22,000 kilograms (48,500 pounds) into LEO — launched 51 small satellites into orbit for multiple companies. But there’s often a waiting period to hitch a ride, and satellites can only go where the rocket is heading. That may be disadvantageous for a satellite that wants to reach a particular orbit, to observe a certain part of the planet. The model does provides advantages. SpaceX says the cost of getting a 500-kilogram (1,100 pound) payload into LEO is about $6,000 per kilogram. “It’s really very, very competitive what SpaceX is now offering,” says Susmita Mohanty, director general of Indian think-tank Spaceport Sarabhai. Skyroot wants to offer dedicated launches for $20,000 per kilogram, which is much more expensive than SpaceX’s less bespoke service. (Chandana says that mass production and better technology may enable further cost reductions). Chandana compares SpaceX’s ridesharing missions as “a train to go to space” and Skyroot’s operations as “cabs to get into space, where we take satellites to their customized locations.” He adds: “We don’t directly compete with SpaceX, because SpaceX is into bigger vehicles and satellites … and what we are into is customized launch solutions.” Once prices drop, there will be more interest in “people wanting to choose dedicated launches without compromising on going for a rideshare mission,” he said. Customized launches might be useful for those who want to send smaller payloads aiming to reach “a diverse amount of orbits” that might not be possible to get to by ridesharing, says Kari Bingen, director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank based in the US. That could be useful for commercial companies, academic institutions or governments that are willing to pay the price, she adds. Chandana is optimistic he can make it more affordable, noting the “frugality in the DNA” of India’s space program. (The country’s Mars orbiter budget was just $74 million. Modi has pointed out that it cost less than the Hollywood sci-fi thriller “Gravity.”) Chandana adds that the company aims to build a reusable rocket eventually, a capability which has helped SpaceX reduce launch costs. India is now home to almost 200 space startups, up from just one in 2014, according to a report published by Deloitte in 2023. Over the same period, private investment into those companies topped $200 million. Skyroot has already raised $95 million, with backers like Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC. That makes it India’s most-funded space startup, according to data platform Tracxn. But the company has work to do to reach profitability. It needs to demonstrate that it can consistently reach orbit, before interest “will turn into contracts, which will help us scale,” says Chandana. Yet spots on Vikram-1 are fully booked, with a mix of domestic and international clients. As Indian space startups mature over the coming years, he expects the government to become a customer, enabling further growth. Many private space companies source income from governments, including Space X, which has raked in billions of dollars from US government contracts. India’s government allocated just under $1.6 billion to develop its space prorgram in its interim 2024 budget. By comparison, NASA received $24.9 billion for 2024. “Unless and until the government backs up the reforms with significant funding coming from India itself, it will be difficult for us to rival the development of the US market or the Chinese market,” says Mohanty. She adds that for Indian startups to play a meaningful role in the global marketplace, “they need to go beyond servicing our own space agency’s domestic mandate and start bidding for contracts.” Chandana sounds up for the challenge. “We want to become globally [one of the] top three launch companies,” he says. “My fascination for rockets has become an obsession.”",india one world top spacefaring nation first asian country reach mar orbit fourth planet take spacecraft moon landing closer south pole known cratered terrain anyone else time private sector played limited role space exploration acting mostly supplier vendor national space agency indian space research organization isro thats changing quickly owing raft government reform aiming boost private participation space sector united state proliferation private company like elon musk spacex boosted washington space ambition driving cost indian homegrown startup like skyroot aerospace launched country first private rocket leading charge commercialize india space sector bolster status space superpower inside sleek rocket hanger southern city hyderabad company preparing liftoff sevenstory tall vikram rocket take india first privately launched satellite orbit thatll major milestone u pawan chandana former isro scientist cofounded skyroot aerospace told cnn company globally able make orbit yet india pushing pioneering national initiative including plan space station put indian astronaut moon meanwhile prime minister narendra modi currently running third consecutive term made major push commercialize space activity recent year including allowing private enterprise take part easing approval foreign investment space sector company around world catapulting thousand satellite low earth orbit leo extends altitude kilometer mile form megaconstellations group small satellite work together beam broadband internet terrestrial user according analytics firm brycetech spacecraft launched small satellite thats driving exponential growth global space economy worth billion according report mckinsey company world economic forum could grow trillion small satellite market skyroot want capture plan offer customized launch satellite kilogram pound organization satellite often piggyback onto rideshare mission last year example one spacex journey powered falcon rocket carry kilogram pound leo launched small satellite orbit multiple company there often waiting period hitch ride satellite go rocket heading may disadvantageous satellite want reach particular orbit observe certain part planet model provides advantage spacex say cost getting kilogram pound payload leo per kilogram really competitive spacex offering say susmita mohanty director general indian thinktank spaceport sarabhai skyroot want offer dedicated launch per kilogram much expensive spacexs le bespoke service chandana say mass production better technology may enable cost reduction chandana compare spacexs ridesharing mission train go space skyroots operation cab get space take satellite customized location add dont directly compete spacex spacex bigger vehicle satellite customized launch solution price drop interest people wanting choose dedicated launch without compromising going rideshare mission said customized launch might useful want send smaller payload aiming reach diverse amount orbit might possible get ridesharing say kari bingen director aerospace security project center strategic international study thinktank based u could useful commercial company academic institution government willing pay price add chandana optimistic make affordable noting frugality dna india space program country mar orbiter budget million modi pointed cost le hollywood scifi thriller gravity chandana add company aim build reusable rocket eventually capability helped spacex reduce launch cost india home almost space startup one according report published deloitte period private investment company topped million skyroot already raised million backer like singapore sovereign wealth fund gic make india mostfunded space startup according data platform tracxn company work reach profitability need demonstrate consistently reach orbit interest turn contract help u scale say chandana yet spot vikram fully booked mix domestic international client indian space startup mature coming year expects government become customer enabling growth many private space company source income government including space x raked billion dollar u government contract india government allocated billion develop space prorgram interim budget comparison nasa received billion unless government back reform significant funding coming india difficult u rival development u market chinese market say mohanty add indian startup play meaningful role global marketplace need go beyond servicing space agency domestic mandate start bidding contract chandana sound challenge want become globally one top three launch company say fascination rocket become obsession,70.0,positive,0
cnn,New Delhi chokes as trash mountain fire spreads hazardous fumes,"Apr 24, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/23/india/ghazipur-delhi-landfill-fire-intl-hnk/index.html,"India’s capital choked on toxic fumes Tuesday, as a thick and pungent haze spread from a fire at a towering trash dump, the latest in a series of landfill blazes that authorities have struggled for years to bring under control. Sections of the Ghazipur landfill in New Delhi burst into flames on Sunday, causing dangerous heat and methane emissions and adding to India’s growing climate challenges. By Tuesday, the blaze at the capital’s largest landfill had largely been put out, but people living nearby complained of throat and eye irritation due to lingering acrid air, according to local media reports. The cause of the fire remains unknown; landfill blazes are often triggered by combustible gases from disintegrating garbage. Every year, as mercury levels soar during New Delhi’s scorching summers, the city’s landfills burst into flames, with rotting waste adding to India’s climate-heating methane gas emissions. Methane is the second most abundant greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide but is a more potent contributor to the climate crisis because it traps more heat. India creates more methane from landfill sites than any other country, according to GHGSat, which monitors emissions via satellites. The trash mountain at Ghazipur is just one of some 3,000 Indian landfills overflowing with decaying waste and emitting hazardous gases, according to a 2023 report from the Center for Science and Environment, a nonprofit research agency in New Delhi. Standing at 65 meters (213 feet), it is nearly as tall as the historic Taj Mahal, and an eyesore that towers over surrounding homes, harming residents’ health. Exposure to methane can aggravate lung diseases, cause asthma and increase the risk of stroke, according to the non-profit Global Clean Air Initiative. Methane emissions aren’t the only hazard stemming from landfills. Over decades, toxins have seeped into the ground, polluting the water supply for thousands living nearby. At Bhalswa, one of Delhi’s other large landfills, residents in 2022 complained of deep, painful skin gashes and respiratory issues from years of living near the hazardous mound. More than 2,300 metric tons of solid waste arrives at the Ghazipur dump every day, according to a July 2022 report by a committee tasked with reducing fires there. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi deploys drones every three months to monitor the size of the trash mountain and is experimenting with ways to extract methane from it, the report said. But authorities are struggling to keep up with the flow of trash at the site, which surpassed its capacity in 2002. The committee said bio-mining to extract methane had been slow and it was “highly unlikely local authorities would achieve their target of “flattening the garbage mountain” this year. Solutions to the waste problem were outlined in a 2019 Indian government report, which recommended formalizing the recycling sector and installing more compost plants. But while some improvements have been made in the country, such as better door-to-door garbage collection and processing of waste, India’s landfills continue to grow. As part of his “Clean India” initiative, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said efforts are being made to remove garbage mountains and convert them into green zones. That goal, if achieved, could relieve some of the suffering of those living in the shadows of enormous dump sites – and help the world lower its greenhouse gas emissions. But while India wants to reduce its methane output, it hasn’t joined 155 countries that have signed up to the Global Methane Pledge, a pact to collectively cut global emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Scientists estimate the reduction could cut global temperature rise by 0.2% – and help the world reach its target of keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius. India has said it won’t join because most of its methane emissions come from farming – some 74% from farm animals and paddy fields versus less than 15% from landfill.",india capital choked toxic fume tuesday thick pungent haze spread fire towering trash dump latest series landfill blaze authority struggled year bring control section ghazipur landfill new delhi burst flame sunday causing dangerous heat methane emission adding india growing climate challenge tuesday blaze capital largest landfill largely put people living nearby complained throat eye irritation due lingering acrid air according local medium report cause fire remains unknown landfill blaze often triggered combustible gas disintegrating garbage every year mercury level soar new delhi scorching summer city landfill burst flame rotting waste adding india climateheating methane gas emission methane second abundant greenhouse gas carbon dioxide potent contributor climate crisis trap heat india creates methane landfill site country according ghgsat monitor emission via satellite trash mountain ghazipur one indian landfill overflowing decaying waste emitting hazardous gas according report center science environment nonprofit research agency new delhi standing meter foot nearly tall historic taj mahal eyesore tower surrounding home harming resident health exposure methane aggravate lung disease cause asthma increase risk stroke according nonprofit global clean air initiative methane emission arent hazard stemming landfill decade toxin seeped ground polluting water supply thousand living nearby bhalswa one delhi large landfill resident complained deep painful skin gash respiratory issue year living near hazardous mound metric ton solid waste arrives ghazipur dump every day according july report committee tasked reducing fire municipal corporation delhi deploys drone every three month monitor size trash mountain experimenting way extract methane report said authority struggling keep flow trash site surpassed capacity committee said biomining extract methane slow highly unlikely local authority would achieve target flattening garbage mountain year solution waste problem outlined indian government report recommended formalizing recycling sector installing compost plant improvement made country better doortodoor garbage collection processing waste india landfill continue grow part clean india initiative indian prime minister narendra modi said effort made remove garbage mountain convert green zone goal achieved could relieve suffering living shadow enormous dump site help world lower greenhouse gas emission india want reduce methane output hasnt joined country signed global methane pledge pact collectively cut global emission least level scientist estimate reduction could cut global temperature rise help world reach target keeping global warming degree celsius india said wont join methane emission come farming farm animal paddy field versus le landfill,-33.0,negative,0
cnn,Modi’s Muslim remarks spark ‘hate speech’ accusations as India’s mammoth election deepens divides,"Apr 22, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/22/asia/india-modi-muslim-hate-speech-allegations-intl-hnk/index.html,"India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been accused of delivering Islamophobic remarks during an election rally Sunday, triggering widespread anger from prominent Muslims and members of the opposition. The world’s most populous nation is in the midst of a mammoth weeks-long election in which Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is widely expected to secure a rare third consecutive term. Speaking in front of a large crowd in the country’s western Rajasthan state, Modi said if voted into power, the country’s main opposition, the Indian National Congress, would distribute the country’s wealth among “infiltrators” and “those who have more children,” in apparent reference to the Muslim community. “When they (the Congress) were in power, they said Muslims have first right over resources. They will gather all your wealth and distribute it among those who have more children. They will distribute among infiltrators,” Modi said to thunderous roars from the audience. “Do you think your hard-earned money should be given to infiltrators? Would you accept this?” Modi said. Those remarks have been seized on by the opposition, who have long accused Modi and the BJP of using divisive rhetoric to turbo-charge their increasingly popular brand of Hindu nationalism. Opposition members have called on the Election Commission of India (ECI) to investigate whether Modi’s comments break the body’s code of conduct. The code states politicians must not appeal to voters based on “caste” and “communal feelings.” Activity which “may aggravate differences or create mutual hatred or cause tension” between communities and religions, is also not allowed. CNN has contacted the ECI for comment. Modi received widespread backlash from members of the Muslim community for his comments at a time when many fear a third BJP term will deepen the communal fissures already running through the country. “This is not a dogwhistle, this is a targeted, direct, brazen hate speech against a community,” prominent Muslim journalist Rana Ayyub wrote on X. Muslim lawmaker and president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen, Asaduddin Owaisi, said: “Modi today called Muslims infiltrators and people with many children. Since 2002 till this day, the only Modi guarantee has been to abuse Muslims and get votes.” Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge described Modi’s comments as “hate speech” and “a well thought out ploy to divert attention.” “Today the prime minister did what he has learnt from the values of the Sangh,” referring to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) a right-wing Hindu paramilitary organization, which Modi was once a youth member of and to which the BJP is affiliated with. “In the history of India, no prime minister has lowered the dignity of his post as much as Modi has.” Modi swept to power in 2014 on a promise of development and anti-corruption, rising in popularity during his term and getting re-elected five years later – the second time on a more openly Hindu nationalist ticket. Over the last decade, Modi and his BJP have been accused of driving religious polarization with their Hindu nationalist policies, giving rise to a wave of Islamophobia and deadly communal clashes in the world’s largest secular democracy. India’s minority Muslim population is enormous – some 230 million people – and Muslims have lived in what is now modern India for centuries. But a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists is to accuse Muslims of being somehow outsiders and spreading a false narrative that they are displacing the country’s Hindu population by deliberately having large families. The BJP has repeatedly said it does not discriminate based on religion and treats all citizens equally. But research, reporting and rights groups say divisions have increased in the country of 1.4 billion people. Anti-Muslim speech has risen dramatically, a recent report by the Washington-based research group India Hate Lab showed, which documented 668 such cases in 2023. Of these cases, 75% took place in BJP-ruled states, the report said. India prohibits hate speech under several sections of its penal code, including a section which criminalizes “deliberate and malicious acts” intended to insult religious beliefs, but rights groups say there is a lack of immediate and adequate action against the alleged perpetrators of such acts, giving right-wing extremists tacit support.",india prime minister narendra modi accused delivering islamophobic remark election rally sunday triggering widespread anger prominent muslim member opposition world populous nation midst mammoth weekslong election modis ruling bharatiya janata party bjp widely expected secure rare third consecutive term speaking front large crowd country western rajasthan state modi said voted power country main opposition indian national congress would distribute country wealth among infiltrator child apparent reference muslim community congress power said muslim first right resource gather wealth distribute among child distribute among infiltrator modi said thunderous roar audience think hardearned money given infiltrator would accept modi said remark seized opposition long accused modi bjp using divisive rhetoric turbocharge increasingly popular brand hindu nationalism opposition member called election commission india eci investigate whether modis comment break body code conduct code state politician must appeal voter based caste communal feeling activity may aggravate difference create mutual hatred cause tension community religion also allowed cnn contacted eci comment modi received widespread backlash member muslim community comment time many fear third bjp term deepen communal fissure already running country dogwhistle targeted direct brazen hate speech community prominent muslim journalist rana ayyub wrote x muslim lawmaker president india majliseittehadulmuslimeen asaduddin owaisi said modi today called muslim infiltrator people many child since till day modi guarantee abuse muslim get vote congress chief mallikarjun kharge described modis comment hate speech well thought ploy divert attention today prime minister learnt value sangh referring rashtriya swayamsevak sangh r rightwing hindu paramilitary organization modi youth member bjp affiliated history india prime minister lowered dignity post much modi modi swept power promise development anticorruption rising popularity term getting reelected five year later second time openly hindu nationalist ticket last decade modi bjp accused driving religious polarization hindu nationalist policy giving rise wave islamophobia deadly communal clash world largest secular democracy india minority muslim population enormous million people muslim lived modern india century false conspiracy voiced hindu nationalist accuse muslim somehow outsider spreading false narrative displacing country hindu population deliberately large family bjp repeatedly said discriminate based religion treat citizen equally research reporting right group say division increased country billion people antimuslim speech risen dramatically recent report washingtonbased research group india hate lab showed documented case case took place bjpruled state report said india prohibits hate speech several section penal code including section criminalizes deliberate malicious act intended insult religious belief right group say lack immediate adequate action alleged perpetrator act giving rightwing extremist tacit support,-26.0,negative,2
cnn,Opinion: The Indian election issue that will impact the world (and no one is talking about),"Apr 20, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/19/opinions/indian-election-climate-change-pillai/index.html,"It’s hard to truly comprehend how difficult and relentless a problem climate change is for a country as large as India. One way would be to rig a drone with a very large battery pack and fly it from one end to the other. Start in the south in Bangalore, India’s Silicon Valley, in the fall of 2022. Fly very, very slowly northwards until you reach the Himalayas just before the national elections that started this week. You would witness a country in constant convulsion. Soon after take off, you’d see the swish houses and gleaming towers of Bangalore’s new tech and corporate elite submerged amid September 2022’s monsoon rains. Just a little further north and a few months on in March 2023, record breaking fires tear through Karnataka state’s forests, the smoke obscuring vision for days. Then, on to the heaving, humid metropolis of Mumbai at summer’s onset in April 2023 to find over a dozen people dead, mostly women, due to heat exposure at a large public gathering. Next, entire stretches of Delhi under water from flooding in July. That same summer, hospitals in the sunburnt state of Uttar Pradesh, home to over 240 million people, fill with listless, heat-stroked workers. Finally, the anticipated visual reprieve of the Himalayan snow caps that never comes — instead replaced by an almost snowless winter that continues into 2024. The impacts of India’s extreme weather are not neatly contained within the country’s borders. This is a global worry. When India introduces wheat export bans due to a heat wave or slows its vaunted IT exports because Bangalore is underwater, the lives of seemingly unconnected millions across the world are affected. India is the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the US. It is also the world’s fastest-growing major economy. How India handles climate change, then, is everyone’s concern. But while climate is mentioned in the election manifestos of the two main parties — the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress — it will, perhaps surprisingly, not feature as a major issue in India’s six-week-long national election that started this week. That’s unlike in Australia, the UK and US, among others, where elections can be significantly influenced by climate policy positions. This is because climate politics looks different in the developing world; it will shape Indian elections in definitive but under-the-radar ways. Climate impacts do shape voter demands — though this tends to filter through as anxieties about livelihood and continued welfare support, rather than in a neatly defined area of politics labeled “climate.” You can see it in farmers asking for loan waivers and irrigation facilities after years of drought, in urban families demanding reduced electricity prices to offset cooling bills and in calls for more penetrating social welfare. Here in the world’s most-populous country, the average Indian does not emit very much at present. India’s relatively low per-capita carbon emissions of 1.9 tons per person are less than half of the global average of 4.7 tons per person — and several times lower than developed economies. This duality — low per-capita emissions and a rapidly growing economy — also shapes India’s climate policy. The incumbent government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has both pushed the rapid deployment of renewables and domestic green manufacturing to create jobs, while continuing to rely on fossil fuels to power the economy. That’s fairly similar to previous governments. Leaf through the BJP and Congress’ election manifestos and you will find several dozen pledges across sectors that could be filed under climate policy, with a roughly even split between the two parties (though their emphases predictably differ). But these are listed across several chapters and rarely mention the word “climate” (though each has a separate chapter on sustainable development). Similarly, stump speeches throughout this campaign season have not featured climate change as a central issue. Parties do however focus on climate-adjacent developmental issues — including expanding entitlements for the poorest (which could also help with weather shocks), creating jobs through green manufacturing and reconfiguring Indian agriculture. But politics here seems to reflect the relative insignificance of climate change as a conceptual category in the Indian voter’s mind. When tens of thousands of farmers marched through Maharashtra in 2018 after several years of drought across parts of the state, they protested against rising agricultural debt, declining productivity, pests and inadequate irrigation. This was a climate protest in all but slogan. Take for example a Muslim woman I spoke with a few years ago from the poorer reaches of North Bengal. Her small house in an informal settlement in Delhi was engulfed in a summer fire, and then a few years later her family home in Bengal was damaged in a monsoon flood. She supports a large family of children and grandchildren as a house cleaner in Delhi’s rich neighbourhoods. Despite the fingerprint of climate impacts on her past, her main demands in previous elections were for regular water (which she gets once in two weeks from a water truck), cheaper electricity (she told me she pays around three times the price her rich employers pay because of an illegal connection), and cheaper health care. Elections turn, then, on meeting developmental exigency. The headwinds of climate change are absorbed by the electoral machine and emerge as end-of-tailpipe policies rather than grand climate strategy. This pattern of climate politics is reinforced by seemingly low recognition in India of climate change as a problem. In a 2022 survey of over 4,500 individuals across the country, over 50% of respondents said they knew little or nothing about climate change. Interestingly, recognition of climate change increased to over 80% in that survey when respondents were supplied with a short description of the phenomenon. The hotch-potch of ad hoc policy fixes that emerges around climate issues will only get the country so far. It fails when put to the long-term test. Mobilizing large amounts of public finance to redesign cities to trap less heat and flood less, for example, requires a genuine public debate about a climate-ravaged future. Immediate investments are necessary to dull the blow tomorrow. The climate crisis also deepens the case for global cooperation. India’s climate-outages are going to be hard for trading partners and global markets to ignore as its economy grows. Domestic politics that focus on immediate developmental goals rather than long-term climate-proofing creates a gaping hole that global adaptation finance must fill. This has a moral dimension, too. The climate impacts buffeting India today are largely because of the historical emissions of developed counterparts. Global resilience must be a priority in an interconnected world. The climate impacts buffeting the most populous nation on earth aren’t just a domestic issue — they’re an international one.

cnn,India heads to the polls in world’s biggest election,"Apr 19, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/18/india/india-general-election-polls-open-intl-hnk/index.html,"Polls opened Friday in the first and largest phase of India’s marathon election, in which populist Prime Minister Narendra Modi is widely expected to secure a rare third consecutive term and deepen his historic transformation of the world’s most populous nation. About 969 million people are eligible to vote in the biggest democratic exercise in human history, with polling taking place in seven phases over the next six weeks. Votes will be counted on June 4. It is considered among the most consequential votes in decades, with Modi’s powerful right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seeking an outright majority in the lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha. An emphatic win for the BJP would give the party a mandate to further enshrine its Hindu-nationalist agenda, pulling away from India’s secular foundation toward majoritarian rule. Opposing the BJP juggernaut is an alliance of more than two dozen parties, including India’s main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, which are campaigning to reduce inequality and uphold what they say are India’s at-risk democratic institutions. Throughout its decade in power, the BJP has come under scrutiny from rights groups for its increasingly strident brand of Hindu nationalist politics and an ongoing crackdown on dissent and democratic freedoms. Yet Modi and his party have been buoyed by levels of popularity not seen in decades. According to 2023 Pew research, about eight-in-ten Indian adults have a favorable view of the prime minister. Since coming to power in 2014, Modi has overseen massive infrastructure spending, building highways, power plants and maritime projects, as well as subsidizing the construction of millions of concrete homes for improvised families. “The BJP has developed the country significantly in the past ten years. Corruption and crime has decreased drastically. What more can we ask for?” Aditya Garg, 29, told CNN from a voting station in Muzaffarnagar, in Uttar Pradesh. Under Modi’s leadership, the country of 1.4 billion people has become the world’s fastest-growing major economy and a modern global power. Despite these successes, soaring youth unemployment and inequality remain stubbornly persistent problems, particularly in rural areas, and critics say Modi has driven religious polarization, which has included rising Islamophobia and persecution of the country’s 230 million Muslims. Modi has walked a fine line geopolitically, placing India as a crucial counterpoint between global powers, and the Unites States, Russia and China will be watching the election closely. As polls opened Friday, the leader had a message for voters. “I urge all those voting in these seats to exercise their franchise in record numbers,” he wrote on X. Modi has set an ambitious target to secure a 400-seat supermajority, with 370 directly controlled by his BJP – up from 303 in 2019 – and the others from its National Democratic Alliance. The BJP’s campaign manifesto centers on job creation and anti-poverty and development programs, with particular focus on women, the poor, young people and farmers. Modi wants to turn India into a global manufacturing hub, continue its massive infrastructure transformation, and achieve energy independence by 2047. Worth $3.7 trillion in 2023, India is the world’s fifth largest economy, having jumped four spots in the rankings during his decade in office. Modi has pledged that India will have the world’s third largest economy during a possible third term. However, economic successes have been slow to trickle down to the country’s poorest and India’s gross domestic product (GDP) per person is ranked a lowly 147 in 2022, according to the World Bank. “Everything has become so expensive; how can poor people survive in this climate? I think it’s time for a change,” said Irafan Mohammad, a Muzaffarnagar rickshaw driver, who has four children and earns $6 a day. Modi wants India to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, will push to bid for the 2036 Summer Olympics and aims to land an astronaut on the moon, and has pledged to transform the country into a developed nation by 2047. Challenging him is the country’s main opposition, the Indian National Congress, a party instrumental ending nearly 200 years of British colonial rule and one that has governed for much of its independent history. But over the last decade, it has struggled to find relevance, unable to break through the popularity of India’s incumbent leader. Rahul Gandhi, the son of the famed Gandhi dynasty is the face of the party. He lost the past two elections to Modi and will be contending once again from the southern state of Kerala. In a bid to unseat Modi, the Congress last year joined hands with a number of regional parties to form the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, known as INDIA. But that alliance has started to see cracks emerge with a number of detractions to the BJP. It has also yet to put forward a candidate for prime minister. Opposition leaders and parties have faced a slew of legal and financial challenges in the run-up to this year’s election, with many accusing the BJP of using state agencies to stifle and attack its opponents. The arrest last month of the popular Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi and a staunch Modi critic sparked protests in the capital and prompted claims of a political “conspiracy” by his party. Modi and the BJP have denied political interference, with one senior party leader saying it was a “process of law” to take “appropriate action against corruption.” However, Congress’ manifesto has been dubbed one of India’s most progressive, pledging “freedom from fear” and vowing to protect freedom of speech, expression and religious belief espoused in the constitution. Voters are casting their ballots for 543 seats in the lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha, with a further two seats nominated by the country’s president. The party with the majority will form a government and appoint one of its winning candidates as prime minister. On Friday, voters from constituencies in 21 states and union territories across India  electronically cast their ballots. Some states are so big that voting is spread out over the seven phases, while others vote on one day. Among the most politically important states is Uttar Pradesh, home to 240 million people who vote in all seven phases. India’s largest state is a crucial battleground with 80 seats in the Lok Sabha up for grabs. Home to the iconic Taj Mahal and India’s holiest city, Modi’s constituency of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh is also one of the country’s poorest. And while some 38 million Muslims call Uttar Pradesh home, it is considered the BJP’s Hindu heartland and growing increasingly divided along lines of class, caste and religion. Aqdas Siddiqui, 26, is a businessman voting in Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar. He says though he’s a Muslim, he’ll vote for the BJP. “They’ve brought in a lot of welfare schemes for the poor and Muslims are the biggest beneficiary. The government has also cut red tape and the country has become more business-friendly,” he said. However, many Muslims CNN spoke to said that they can longer accept being marginalized by the current government and voted for the opposition. “A country is like a family, it can only develop if the head of the family treats everyone equally and doesn’t discriminate,” said Mehtab Ali, 54.",poll opened friday first largest phase india marathon election populist prime minister narendra modi widely

cnn,Can India become an economic superpower? Here’s what the data says,"Apr 19, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/economy/india-election-modi-economic-performance-intl-hnk-dg/index.html,"Indians have started casting their votes in an election that’s expected to hand Prime Minister Narendra Modi another five years in office to steer the country’s rapid economic expansion. Under his leadership, India is poised to become a 21st-century economic powerhouse, offering a real alternative to China for investors and consumer brands hunting for growth and manufacturers looking to reduce risks in their supply chains. While ties between Beijing and the West are becoming increasingly frayed, India enjoys healthy relations with most major economies and is aggressively wooing large companies to set up factories in the country. So, is the hype around Modi’s India, which remains a largely impoverished country, justified? The quality of economic data in India can be unreliable, which makes it tough to evaluate the reality on the ground in the world’s most populous nation. But by using data from official or authoritative sources, CNN has created five charts to show how the country has performed since Modi first rose to power in 2014, and to look ahead at the challenges the next leader will face in managing the world’s fastest growing major economy. India’s economy was worth $3.7 trillion in 2023, making it the world’s fifth largest, having jumped four spots in the rankings during Modi’s decade in office. The South Asian giant’s economy is comfortably placed to expand at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, but analysts say it should be targeting growth of 8% or more if it wants to become an economic superpower. Sustained expansion will push India higher up the ranks of the world’s biggest economies, with some observers forecasting the country to become number three behind only the US and China by 2027. However, India could do much more to raise its gross domestic product (GDP) per person, a measure of living standards according to which it ranked a lowly 147 in 2022, according to the World Bank. According to Guido Cozzi, professor of macroeconomics at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland, there will be “trickle down effects on per-capita GDP” as the economy grows. But he cautioned that “trickle-down economics is not guaranteed to reduce income inequality, and policies that promote inclusive growth may be necessary.” Much as China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. Meanwhile, private investors are building the world’s biggest green energy plant. In this year’s federal budget alone, $134 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion. The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added nearly 55,000 kilometers (around 35,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 60% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2023. Infrastructure development has many benefits for the economy, including creating jobs and improving the ease of doing business. In recent years, the country has also built a range of tech platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed lives and businesses. For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has provided millions of Indians with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database has also helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives. Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy. In September 2023, citing a World Bank report, Modi said that thanks to its digital public infrastructure “India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just six years which would otherwise have taken at least 47 long years.” The excitement around India’s growth potential is reflected in its stock market, which has been hitting record highs. The value of companies listed on India’s exchanges surpassed $4 trillion late last year. India has two major exchanges: the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and the BSE, Asia’s oldest bourse formerly known as the Bombay Stock Exchange. Thanks to the sizzling rally, the NSE has overtaken both the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Exchange to become the world’s sixth largest bourse, data from the World Federation of Exchanges showed in January. Domestic investors, both retail and institutional, have been driving India’s stock market to unprecedented peaks. According to Macquarie Capital, retail investors alone own 9% of India’s equity market value, while foreign investors are at slightly less than 20%. Analysts, however, expect foreign investments to pick up in the second half of 2024, once the election is out of the way. The Modi government is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington. Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices. As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple (AAPL) supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India. Billionaire Elon Musk said last week on X that he is “looking forward” to meeting Modi in India, without giving a date. The Tesla (TSLA) boss is expected to announce a major investment in India soon, with the automaker reportedly scouring the country for a suitable location for its first Asian factory outside China. Until two years ago, Apple would typically start assembling models in the country only seven to eight months after launch. That changed in September 2022, when Apple started making new iPhone 14 devices in India weeks after they went on sale. Analysts have called the change in strategy a big win for Modi, as growing manufacturing ties with a US giant like Apple will in turn attract other global players in the electronics manufacturing ecosystem to India. According to market research firm Canalys, up to 23% of iPhones will be made in India by the end of 2025, up from 6% in 2022. Still, India’s economy, much like its democracy, is far from perfect. If re-elected, Modi has to tackle the enormous challenge of creating hundreds of millions of jobs for a population that remains largely impoverished. With an average age of 29 years, India has one of the youngest populations globally, but the country is not yet able to reap the potential economic benefits from its large, youthful population. According to a report last month by the International Labour Organization, educated Indians between the ages of 15 and 29 are more likely to be unemployed than those without any schooling, which reflects “a mismatch with their aspirations and available jobs.” Youth unemployment rates in India are now higher than global levels, it added. The unemployment rate for young Indians with a graduate degree was over 29%, almost nine times higher those who can’t read or write, the report said. “The Indian economy has not been able to create enough remunerative jobs in the non-farm sectors for new educated youth labour force entrants, which is reflected in the high and increasing unemployment rate,” it added.",indian started casting vote

cnn,India election: A visual guide to voting in the world’s largest democracy,"Apr 19, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/17/india/india-election-2024-hnk-intl-dg/index.html,"A mammoth exercise in democracy is underway in India, where nearly a billion people will go to the polls over the next six weeks to vote in the world’s largest ever general election. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is standing for a rare third term in power, against an alliance of opposition parties that are seeking to unseat him. Here is a look at how the world’s most populous country votes in the world’s largest democracy. Home to more than 1.4 billion people, about 969 million are eligible to cast their vote in the upcoming election — more than the populations of North America and the European Union combined. This means about 12% of the world’s population will head to the polls, motivated by a range of issues from unemployment and welfare benefits to infrastructure and upholding democracy. The number of women registered to vote has increased by 40 million since the previous election in 2019, according to the election commission, while more than 20 million voters between ages 18-29 have been added to the electorate. Indians will be voting for 543 seats in the 545-seat lower house of parliament, called the Lok Sabha, with two other seats nominated by the country’s president. The party that wins a majority will appoint one of its winning candidates as prime minister and form a ruling government. Voting begins on Friday, April 19, and will continue through June 1, with results announced on June 4. Some states only have one day to vote, while the country’s most populous state in the north, Uttar Pradesh, and the eastern states of Bihar and West Bengal with an estimated combined population of 475 million, will vote across a span of seven days. Here’s how and when the election takes place: From the high peaks of the Himalayas to the remote forests in India’s central states, votes will be cast electronically across more than one million polling stations in the country — a 1.2% increase in the number of stations from the previous election in 2019. This operation requires some 15 million polling officials and security staff during the election, with some of these election workers traveling via road, boat, camel, train, and helicopters to reach India’s citizens.",mammoth exercise democracy underway india nearly billion people go poll next six week vote world largest ever general election prime minister narendra modi standing rare third term power alliance opposition party seeking unseat look world populous country vote world largest democracy home billion people million eligible cast vote upcoming election population north america european union combined mean world population head poll motivated range issue unemployment welfare benefit infrastructure upholding democracy number woman registered vote increased million since previous election according election commission million voter age added electorate indian voting seat seat lower house parliament called lok sabha two seat nominated country president party win majority appoint one winning candidate prime minister form ruling government voting begin friday april continue june result announced june state one day vote country populous state north uttar pradesh eastern state bihar west bengal estimated combined population million vote across span seven day here election take place high peak himalaya remote forest india central state vote cast electronically across one million polling station country increase number station previous election operation requires million polling official security staff election election worker traveling via road boat camel train helicopter reach india citizen,13.0,positive,2
cnn,"Cash, drugs and booze among record election bribes seized by India","Apr 17, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/17/india/india-election-commission-bribe-seizure-hnk-intl/index.html,"A record quantity of bribes, including cash, booze, drugs and precious metals, has been seized by Indian election authorities in the run-up to mammoth nationwide polls that begin on Friday. The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Monday revealed it had recovered inducements worth just over $550 million since March — the largest amount in the country’s 75-year electoral history. It marks a “sharp increase” on the more than $400 million in bribes seized by the ECI in the country’s last general election in 2019, the agency said. The two states that saw the highest total amounts change hands are both strongholds of the ruling right-wing Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP): Rajasthan and neighboring Gujarat, home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. While Gujarat recorded the largest amount in drug seizures, Rajasthan was top of the list for “freebies” — goods and services promised (usually by politicians) gratis to voters in exchange for their support. Modi previously took aim at what he described as a culture of offering freebies for votes during a 2022 speech, urging voters to be careful. “People of this Revdi (freebies) culture will never build new expressways, new airports or new defense corridors for you,” he said. “People of this Revdi culture think that by distributing freebies to people, they can buy them – together we need to defeat their thinking.” The total value of freebies confiscated ahead of the 2024 vote marked a jump of nearly $130 million from the election five years ago. Data from the ECI’s latest seizures meanwhile show non-BJP-ruled states also topped specific inducement categories. The southern state of Tamil Nadu, a bastion for two regional parties that have held their own against both the BJP and the opposition Indian National Congress for decades, saw the most amount of cash seized. One of the few Congress strongholds, Karnataka, had the most amount of liquor confiscated. “The seizures are a critical part of ECI resolve to conduct the Lok Sabha elections free of inducements and electoral malpractices and to ensure a level playing field,” the Election Commission said Monday, referring to India’s parliament. The ECI said it had also made seizures worth nearly $900 million in January and February, with drugs making up some 75% of those confiscations. India’s political parties and leaders routinely preach against election corruption and inducements, but the level of monitoring and tackling of graft across such a vast nation varies widely. Transparency International’s annual Corruption Perceptions Index ranks India 93rd of the 180 nations and territories it monitors, on par with Kazakhstan and the Maldives. Earlier this year, India’s Supreme Court made a major ruling concerning the often opaque nature of political funding declaring electoral bonds “unconstitutional.” The system, introduced by the Modi government in 2017, allowed individuals or groups to buy bonds from the government-run State Bank of India and donate them anonymously to any political party. Anti-corruption groups had long complained that the system meant a lack of transparency in donations to political parties — allowing corporations to donate large sums without disclosure. The court also urged the disclosure of details around contributors and recipients, paving the way for more transparency in how campaigns are funded. Voting in India’s six-week long election will be conducted in seven phases from Friday, with Modi and his ruling party seeking a rare third consecutive term in power.",record quantity bribe including cash booze drug precious metal seized indian election authority runup mammoth nationwide poll begin friday election commission india eci monday revealed recovered inducement worth million since march largest amount country year electoral history mark sharp increase million bribe seized eci country last general election agency said two state saw highest total amount change hand stronghold ruling rightwing bharatiya janta party bjp rajasthan neighboring gujarat home state prime minister narendra modi gujarat recorded largest amount drug seizure rajasthan top list freebie good service promised usually politician gratis voter exchange support modi previously took aim described culture offering freebie vote speech urging voter careful people revdi freebie culture never build new expressway new airport new defense corridor said people revdi culture think distributing freebie people buy together need defeat thinking total value freebie confiscated ahead vote marked jump nearly million election five year ago data ecis latest seizure meanwhile show nonbjpruled state also topped specific inducement category southern state tamil nadu bastion two regional party held bjp opposition indian national congress decade saw amount cash seized one congress stronghold karnataka amount liquor confiscated seizure critical part eci resolve conduct lok sabha election free inducement electoral malpractice ensure level playing field election commission said monday referring india parliament eci said also made seizure worth nearly million january february drug making confiscation india political party leader routinely preach election corruption inducement level monitoring tackling graft across vast nation varies widely transparency international annual corruption perception index rank india rd nation territory monitor par kazakhstan maldives earlier year india supreme court made major ruling concerning often opaque nature political funding declaring electoral bond unconstitutional system introduced modi government allowed individual group buy bond governmentrun state bank india donate anonymously political party anticorruption group long complained system meant lack transparency donation political party allowing corporation donate large sum without disclosure court also urged disclosure detail around contributor recipient paving way transparency campaign funded voting india sixweek long election conducted seven phase friday modi ruling party seeking rare third consecutive term power,12.0,positive,2
cnn,India summons US State Department official over call for fair legal treatment of arrested opposition leader,"Mar 28, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/28/india/india-state-department-kejriwal-objection-intl-hnk/index.html,"India’s Ministry of External Affairs summoned a US State Department official after the department called for a fair legal process for opposition leader and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal following his arrest last week. “We take strong objection to the remarks of the Spokesperson of the US State Department about certain legal proceedings in India,” the Ministry said in a statement Wednesday. “In diplomacy, states are expected to be respectful of the sovereignty and internal affairs of others. This responsibility is even more so in case of fellow democracies,” the statement added. The Ministry of External Affairs on Wednesday summoned Gloria Berbena, the State Department Minister-Counselor for Public Diplomacy, according to a diplomatic officer with knowledge of the matter. At a briefing later on Wednesday, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller declined to discuss “private diplomatic conversations” when asked about Berbena’s summoning, but stood by the department’s previous comments. “We encourage fair, transparent, timely legal processes. We don’t think anyone should object to that, and we’ll make the same thing clear privately,” Miller said. Kejriwal was taken into custody on March 21 following a raid on his home by the federal financial crimes agency, members of his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said, in the latest blow to an alliance of parties aiming to unseat Modi as he seeks a third consecutive term. He is one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s fiercest critics and Kejriwal’s allies have claimed the arrest was politically motivated. His arrest comes as tensions run high ahead of a crucial nationwide election which begins on April 19, in which Modi is widely expected to leave the opposition languishing despite sharp criticism over his perceived erosion of the country’s democratic founding principles. India’s main opposition, the Indian National Congress, has also accused the BJP of using the tax department to “cripple” their finances. The party claimed their bank accounts had been frozen by the tax department, leaving them unable to use some $20 million in funds. Human Rights group Amnesty International warned following the arrest of Kejriwal that a crackdown on Indian opposition figures and parties by the government had reached a “crisis point” ahead of the national elections. “The arrest of Arvind Kejriwal and the freezing of Indian National Congress’ bank accounts a few weeks before India holds its general elections show the authorities’ blatant failure to uphold the country’s international human rights obligations.”",india ministry external affair summoned u state department official department called fair legal process opposition leader delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal following arrest last week take strong objection remark spokesperson u state department certain legal proceeding india ministry said statement wednesday diplomacy state expected respectful sovereignty internal affair others responsibility even case fellow democracy statement added ministry external affair wednesday summoned gloria berbena state department ministercounselor public diplomacy according diplomatic officer knowledge matter briefing later wednesday state department spokesperson matthew miller declined discus private diplomatic conversation asked berbenas summoning stood department previous comment encourage fair transparent timely legal process dont think anyone object well make thing clear privately miller said kejriwal taken custody march following raid home federal financial crime agency member aam aadmi party aap said latest blow alliance party aiming unseat modi seek third consecutive term one prime minister narendra modis fiercest critic kejriwals ally claimed arrest politically motivated arrest come tension run high ahead crucial nationwide election begin april modi widely expected leave opposition languishing despite sharp criticism perceived erosion country democratic founding principle india main opposition indian national congress also accused bjp using tax department cripple finance party claimed bank account frozen tax department leaving unable use million fund human right group amnesty international warned following arrest kejriwal crackdown indian opposition figure party government reached crisis point ahead national election arrest arvind kejriwal freezing indian national congress bank account week india hold general election show authority blatant failure uphold country international human right obligation,-9.0,negative,0
cnn,Court ruling effectively outlaws Islamic schools in India’s most populous state,"Mar 25, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/24/india/india-madrasa-court-ruling-uttar-pradesh-intl-hnk/index.html,"A court in India’s most populous state has effectively banned Islamic schools by striking down a law governing madrasas, weeks before a nationwide election that could further polarize the world’s largest democracy along religious lines. The Allahabad High Court in Uttar Pradesh on Friday declared the Madrasa Act of 2004 to be unconstitutional, according to a court order seen by CNN, while ordering the state government to move students enrolled in the Islamic system into mainstream schools. “We hold that the Madarsa (sic) Act, 2004, is violative of the principle of Secularism, which is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India,” the high court said in its order. “Since providing education is one of the primary duties of the State, it is bound to remain secular while exercising its powers in the said field. It cannot provide for education of a particular religion, its instructions, prescriptions and philosophies or create separate education systems for separate religions.” Madrasas provide a system of education in which students are taught about the Quran and Islamic history alongside general subjects like math and science. Some Hindus also send their children to an equivalent system known as Gurukuls, residential education institutions where students learn about ancient Vedic scriptures alongside general subjects under a “guru” or teacher. The ruling can be appealed in the country’s Supreme Court. Uttar Pradesh is home to some 200 million people, about 20% of whom are Muslim, according to the country’s most recent census data from 2011. It is governed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and has over the past decade made headlines for passing some of the country’s most controversial laws that critics say discriminate against Muslims and marginalize them in the secular republic. Friday’s court order affects 2.7 million students and 10,000 teachers in 25,000 madrasas, Reuters reported, citing Iftikhar Ahmed Javed, the head of the board of madrasa education in the state. It comes weeks before a nationwide election - the world’s largest - during which an estimated 960 million people are eligible to vote. Modi’s BJP is expected to secure another five years in power, ruling an India that has become increasingly polarized along religious lines. While the Allahabad High Court order cited India’s constitutional separation of religion and state in its reasoning for ruling against madrasas, it is Modi who has been frequently accused by critics of dismantling India’s secular traditions. At the start of the year, for example, Modi presided over a landmark inauguration ceremony of a controversial Hindu temple built on the ruins of a centuries-old mosque that was destroyed by right-wing groups in 1992. The temple’s opening, which was broadcast live by the government and hailed as a new era, was the conclusion of a decades-long campaign by Modi and his BJP party to pull India away from the secular roots upon which the country was founded following independence. Many Muslims and critics of the BJP have raised concerns that India’s secular fabric is also being eroded as anti-Muslim hate speech make frequent headlines and Muslim-owned properties face demolitions. The BJP denies it discriminates against Muslims and says it treats all citizens equally. In December 2020, the northeastern state of Assam passed a law to convert all Islamic schools to regular education institutions. The state’s then Education Minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, who is now Assam’s chief minister, said it would ensure “a right to equal education for all children and eases the path to higher education.” Opposition politicians criticized the move, claiming it was reflective of hardening anti-Muslim attitudes in the Hindu-majority country. Senior state opposition leader Debabrata Saikia at the time said the law was passed by the BJP to “consolidate more Hindu votes.”",court india populous state effectively banned islamic school striking law governing madrasa week nationwide election could polarize world largest democracy along religious line allahabad high court uttar pradesh friday declared madrasa act unconstitutional according court order seen cnn ordering state government move student enrolled islamic system mainstream school hold madarsa sic act violative principle secularism part basic structure constitution india high court said order since providing education one primary duty state bound remain secular exercising power said field provide education particular religion instruction prescription philosophy create separate education system separate religion madrasa provide system education student taught quran islamic history alongside general subject like math science hindu also send child equivalent system known gurukuls residential education institution student learn ancient vedic scripture alongside general subject guru teacher ruling appealed country supreme court uttar pradesh home million people muslim according country recent census data governed prime minister narendra modis hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party bjp past decade made headline passing country controversial law critic say discriminate muslim marginalize secular republic friday court order affect million student teacher madrasa reuters reported citing iftikhar ahmed javed head board madrasa education state come week nationwide election world largest estimated million people eligible vote modis bjp expected secure another five year power ruling india become increasingly polarized along religious line allahabad high court order cited india constitutional separation religion state reasoning ruling madrasa modi frequently accused critic dismantling india secular tradition start year example modi presided landmark inauguration ceremony controversial hindu temple built ruin centuriesold mosque destroyed rightwing group temple opening broadcast live government hailed new era conclusion decadeslong campaign modi bjp party pull india away secular root upon country founded following independence many muslim critic bjp raised concern india secular fabric also eroded antimuslim hate speech make frequent headline muslimowned property face demolition bjp denies discriminates muslim say treat citizen equally december northeastern state assam passed law convert islamic school regular education institution state education minister himanta biswa sarma assam chief minister said would ensure right equal education child eas path higher education opposition politician criticized move claiming reflective hardening antimuslim attitude hindumajority country senior state opposition leader debabrata saikia time said law passed bjp consolidate hindu vote,-15.0,negative,2
cnn,A high-altitude tunnel is latest flashpoint in India-China border tensions,"Mar 22, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/21/india/china-india-sela-tunnel-border-dispute-intl-hnk/index.html,"A tunnel constructed high in the mountains of northeastern India has become the latest flashpoint in a simmering border dispute between New Delhi and Beijing. The Sela Tunnel, inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month, has been hailed in India as a feat of engineering – blasted through the Himalayas at an elevation of some 13,000 feet (3,900 meters) – and a boon for the military, enabling faster, “all-weather” access to a tense de facto border with China. That’s caught the attention of Beijing, whose long-running dispute with New Delhi over their contested 2,100-mile (3,379-kilometer) border has seen the two nuclear-armed powers clash in recent years. That includes in 2020 when hand-to-hand fighting between the two sides resulted in the deaths of at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers in Aksai Chin-Ladakh in the western stretches of the border. And, decades ago, the dispute led to war. China also claims the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, where the tunnel was constructed, as its own, even as the area has long functioned as Indian territory. Chinese officials in recent days have slammed the tunnel project and Modi’s visit to the state, accusing New Delhi of taking steps to undermine peace along the border. “We require the Indian side to cease any action that may complicate the boundary question … the Chinese military remains highly vigilant and will resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” a Defense Ministry spokesperson said last week, using the Chinese name “Zangnan” or South Tibet to refer to Arunachal Pradesh. India hit back on Tuesday, slamming Beijing’s “absurd claims” and saying the area “is and will always be an integral and inalienable part of India.” The US State Department also weighed in during a news conference Wednesday backing India’s sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh and voicing strong opposition to “any unilateral attempts to advance territorial claims by incursions or encroachments” across the line of actual control (LAC), or de facto border. Beijing hit back at this too, accusing Washington of sparing “no efforts to provoke and take advantage of other countries’ conflicts to serve its selfish geopolitical interests.” The spat – which underscores the deep tensions undergirding the relationship between Asia’s two largest countries – comes as India is weeks away from national elections expected to deliver a resounding endorsement of Modi’s Hindu nationalist platform. Rising nationalism under Modi has come alongside a similar phenomenon in China, where leader Xi Jinping has overseen an assertive foreign policy – though both sides have appeared to take steps to cool border tensions following the deadly 2020 clash. Modi on Friday also traveled to Bhutan for a trip “aimed at further cementing the India-Bhutan partnership,” he wrote on social media platform X. The remote Himalayan country bordering Arunachal Pradesh too has a contested border with China, and New Delhi has been wary of a potential settlement between leaders there and in China over that dispute. During his visit to Arunachal Pradesh earlier this month, Modi praised the Sela Tunnel as an “engineering marvel,” while touting a host of other development projects, including those related to border infrastructure. Those projects are part of the intensified push by his government to develop Indian territory along the contested border. That push – which Beijing has signaled it is closely watching – reverses longstanding thinking from the Indian government that not developing the harsh terrain would have a deterrent effect on invasion or encroachment by China. Of 118 projects launched by India’s Border Roads Organization last year to build infrastructure like roads, bridges and airfields, more than half were in Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh, along the disputed border with China. Beijing has accused India of “complicating the boundary question and disrupting the situation in the border areas between the two countries” with such development. But observers say India is addressing an imbalance after decades of Chinese road and infrastructure building gave it a significant advantage over New Delhi in deploying troops to border areas, where it also constructed hundreds of “xiaokang,” or villages, which Beijing denies are meant to enforce its land claims. “Now that India has recognized the benefits of border infrastructure, it is accelerating its building efforts and playing catch-up to China. But its efforts are also likely to raise tensions with China and encourage Beijing to also redouble its own building efforts,” said Byron Chong, a research associate at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy’s Center on Asia and Globalization in Singapore. The Sela Tunnel, which runs from the state of Assam to Arunachal Pradesh’s Tawang, has likely caught special attention from Beijing given the sensitivity of the area, which lies along the line of actual control. New Delhi has said the project will “boost the preparedness of the Armed Forces.” Tawang was the site of a non-lethal scuffle between the two sides in late 2022, according to Indian authorities. Then, New Delhi accused China’s People’s Liberation Army troops of trying to “unilaterally” change the status quo by attempting to cross the LAC. But Tawang may also be especially important to Beijing given its significance within Tibetan Buddhism and China’s concerns surrounding the succession of spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, according to Manoj Kewalramani, who heads Indo-Pacific studies at the Takshashila Institution research center in Bangalore. The Dalai Lama, 88, has lived in exile in India since a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule of Tibet, where Beijing has cracked down on religious practice and sought to exert its control over Tibetan Buddhism. “A lot of this pressure (on Arunachal Pradesh) right now is a product of anticipation of when that event takes place … (in terms of) how China wants India to respond to it and what could be the potential fallout,” he said. But even as the two sides build-up around the border – and China continues a push to entrench its territorial claims in its maps and official language, they have made diplomatic efforts to quell tensions following the deadly 2020 clash. During a meeting on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in South Africa last August, Modi and Xi agreed to “intensify efforts” to deescalate tensions. The Indian and Chinese militaries have also continued to hold border talks, the most recent of which took place last month, when they reiterated a commitment to “maintain peace and tranquility.”",tunnel constructed high mountain northeastern india become latest flashpoint simmering border dispute new delhi beijing sela tunnel inaugurated indian prime minister narendra modi earlier month hailed india feat engineering blasted himalaya elevation foot meter boon military enabling faster allweather access tense de facto border china thats caught attention beijing whose longrunning dispute new delhi contested mile kilometer border seen two nucleararmed power clash recent year includes handtohand fighting two side resulted death least indian four chinese soldier aksai chinladakh western stretch border decade ago dispute led war china also claim indian state arunachal pradesh tunnel constructed even area long functioned indian territory chinese official recent day slammed tunnel project modis visit state accusing new delhi taking step undermine peace along border require indian side cease action may complicate boundary question chinese military remains highly vigilant resolutely defend national sovereignty territorial integrity defense ministry spokesperson said last week using chinese name zangnan south tibet refer arunachal pradesh india hit back tuesday slamming beijing absurd claim saying area always integral inalienable part india u state department also weighed news conference wednesday backing india sovereignty arunachal pradesh voicing strong opposition unilateral attempt advance territorial claim incursion encroachment across line actual control lac de facto border beijing hit back accusing washington sparing effort provoke take advantage country conflict serve selfish geopolitical interest spat underscore deep tension undergirding relationship asia two largest country come india week away national election expected deliver resounding endorsement modis hindu nationalist platform rising nationalism modi come alongside similar phenomenon china leader xi jinping overseen assertive foreign policy though side appeared take step cool border tension following deadly clash modi friday also traveled bhutan trip aimed cementing indiabhutan partnership wrote social medium platform x remote himalayan country bordering arunachal pradesh contested border china new delhi wary potential settlement leader china dispute visit arunachal pradesh earlier month modi praised sela tunnel engineering marvel touting host development project including related border infrastructure project part intensified push government develop indian territory along contested border push beijing signaled closely watching revers longstanding thinking indian government developing harsh terrain would deterrent effect invasion encroachment china project launched india border road organization last year build infrastructure like road bridge airfield half arunachal pradesh ladakh along disputed border china beijing accused india complicating boundary question disrupting situation border area two country development observer say india addressing imbalance decade chinese road infrastructure building gave significant advantage new delhi deploying troop border area also constructed hundred xiaokang village beijing denies meant enforce land claim india recognized benefit border infrastructure accelerating building effort playing catchup china effort also likely raise tension china encourage beijing also redouble building effort said byron chong research associate lee kuan yew school public policy center asia globalization singapore sela tunnel run state assam arunachal pradeshs tawang likely caught special attention beijing given sensitivity area lie along line actual control new delhi said project boost preparedness armed force tawang site nonlethal scuffle two side late according indian authority new delhi accused china people liberation army troop trying unilaterally change status quo attempting cross lac tawang may also especially important beijing given significance within tibetan buddhism china concern surrounding succession spiritual leader dalai lama according manoj kewalramani head indopacific study takshashila institution research center bangalore dalai lama lived exile india since failed uprising chinese rule tibet beijing cracked religious practice sought exert control tibetan buddhism lot pressure arunachal pradesh right product anticipation event take place term china want india respond could potential fallout said even two side buildup around border china continues push entrench territorial claim map official language made diplomatic effort quell tension following deadly clash meeting sideline brics summit south africa last august modi xi agreed intensify effort deescalate tension indian chinese military also continued hold border talk recent took place last month reiterated commitment maintain peace tranquility,-19.0,negative,2
cnn,"Pirate ship capture showcases India’s world-class special forces, analysts say","Mar 20, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/19/india/india-pirate-ship-capture-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,"The Indian Navy’s rescue of a commercial ship from pirates off Somalia’s coast last weekend shows how Delhi’s military has developed special forces capabilities on par with some of the world’s best, analysts say. The navy rescued 17 crew members of the vessel MV Ruen during an anti-piracy operation lasting nearly two days, according to an Indian Navy news release, with no casualties reported. Dozens of pirates were taken into custody, it said. The operation involved a navy destroyer, a patrol ship, an Indian Air Force C-17 transporter flying more than 1,500 miles to airdrop marine commandos, a naval drone, a reconnaissance drone and a P-8 surveillance jet, the release said. “The success of the operation marks the Indian Navy as a top-class force in terms of training, command and control and other capabilities,” said John Bradford, Council on Foreign Relations International Affairs fellow. “What marks this operation as impressive is how risk was minimized by using a coordinated force that includes use of a warship, drones, fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, and marine commandos.” Experts fear the volatile security situation in the Red Sea due to attacks by Yemen-based Houthi rebels on commercial shipping may tie up international forces and provide a window for Somali pirates in the nearby Horn of Africa – presenting a multi-billion-dollar threat to the global economy. Yemen and Somalia are among the region’s poorest nations, both ravaged by years of civil war. Somali pirates’ capture of the MV Ruen in December last year marked the first successful hijacking of a vessel off the country’s coast since 2017. Spanish, Japanese and Indian warships tracked the Malta-flagged, Bulgarian-managed bulk carrier as it was taken into Somali territorial waters, according to a December report from the European Union Naval Force. But when the Ruen, now operated by a pirate crew, last week left Somali waters with the intent of committing acts of piracy on the high seas, the Indian Navy made moves to intercept it, according to a navy statement posted on social platform X. The destroyer INS Kolkata, operating in the area to help ensure international maritime security, used a ship-launched drone to confirm the Ruen was being operated by armed pirates, the Indian statement said. After the pirates fired on the drone, destroying it, and then on the Indian warship itself, the Kolkata responded by firing on the Ruen, disabling its steering and navigation, the statement said. As the Kolkata sought the surrender of the pirates, the commandos parachuted in after a 10-hour flight from India, the air force said on X. Rafts were also dropped into the ocean from the large transport for marines to reach the Ruen. The Indian show of force proved too much for the pirates. “Due to sustained pressure and calibrated actions by the Indian Navy over the last 40 hours, all 35 Somali pirates surrendered,” the navy statement said. Bulgarian leaders, including President Rumen Radev, thanked India and its Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the operation. “My sincere gratitude to (Modi) for the brave action of (the) Navy rescuing the hijacked Bulgarian ship ‘Ruen’ and its crew, including 7 Bulgarian citizens,” Radev posted on X. Analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, said the incident highlighted the professionalism of the Indian Navy and said Delhi’s marine commando force, known as MARCOS, had learned from its US and British counterparts. “The Indian Navy itself is a highly trained and disciplined professional force,” Schuster said. “MARCOS’ nearly eight months of training is modeled after Britain’s SAS. Despite a very intense selection process, only about 10% to 15% of those who enter the training graduate,” he said. The analysts noted that the Indian Navy is experienced in anti-piracy operations, going back more than 20 years – and the restive security situation in one of the world’s major shipping lanes meant they were likely to be called on again. In a January media briefing, an Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson said maritime security in the region is a priority for India. “The ongoing activities there are indeed a matter of concern, and it affects our economic interests,” official spokesperson Shri Randhir Jaiswal said. “We are consistently monitoring the situation. Our naval forces, naval vessels are engaged in ensuring the safety of our commercial vessels,” Jaiswal said.",indian navy rescue commercial ship pirate somalia coast last weekend show delhi military developed special force capability par world best analyst say navy rescued crew member vessel mv ruen antipiracy operation lasting nearly two day according indian navy news release casualty reported dozen pirate taken custody said operation involved navy destroyer patrol ship indian air force c transporter flying mile airdrop marine commando naval drone reconnaissance drone p surveillance jet release said success operation mark indian navy topclass force term training command control capability said john bradford council foreign relation international affair fellow mark operation impressive risk minimized using coordinated force includes use warship drone fixed rotarywing aircraft marine commando expert fear volatile security situation red sea due attack yemenbased houthi rebel commercial shipping may tie international force provide window somali pirate nearby horn africa presenting multibilliondollar threat global economy yemen somalia among region poorest nation ravaged year civil war somali pirate capture mv ruen december last year marked first successful hijacking vessel country coast since spanish japanese indian warship tracked maltaflagged bulgarianmanaged bulk carrier taken somali territorial water according december report european union naval force ruen operated pirate crew last week left somali water intent committing act piracy high sea indian navy made move intercept according navy statement posted social platform x destroyer in kolkata operating area help ensure international maritime security used shiplaunched drone confirm ruen operated armed pirate indian statement said pirate fired drone destroying indian warship kolkata responded firing ruen disabling steering navigation statement said kolkata sought surrender pirate commando parachuted hour flight india air force said x raft also dropped ocean large transport marine reach ruen indian show force proved much pirate due sustained pressure calibrated action indian navy last hour somali pirate surrendered navy statement said bulgarian leader including president rumen radev thanked india prime minister narendra modi operation sincere gratitude modi brave action navy rescuing hijacked bulgarian ship ruen crew including bulgarian citizen radev posted x analyst carl schuster former u navy captain said incident highlighted professionalism indian navy said delhi marine commando force known marcos learned u british counterpart indian navy highly trained disciplined professional force schuster said marcos nearly eight month training modeled britain sa despite intense selection process enter training graduate said analyst noted indian navy experienced antipiracy operation going back year restive security situation one world major shipping lane meant likely called january medium briefing indian ministry external affair spokesperson said maritime security region priority india ongoing activity indeed matter concern affect economic interest official spokesperson shri randhir jaiswal said consistently monitoring situation naval force naval vessel engaged ensuring safety commercial vessel jaiswal said,6.0,positive,0

The Polish superstar didn’t drop a set during the tournament and lost just 21 games en route to her second WTA 1000 title of the year after winning February’s Qatar Open. Świątek, who was stunned by Linda Noskova in the Australian Open third round, has now won her last six WTA finals to extend her career record to 19-4. “I’m really proud of myself,” Świątek said, per the WTA. “I’m super happy. I mean, even though this tournament looked like, the scores, maybe I had everything under control, it wasn’t from the beginning to the end so easy. “So I’m happy I could improve during the tournament. I felt really good on the last two matches, big amount of confidence.” Still only 22 years old, Świątek has already won four grand slam titles and eight WTA 1000 titles. In a rematch of the 2022 final – which Świątek clinched with a similarly imperious 6-4 6-1 win – the Pole narrowly edged a back-and-forth opening set, but the second was over in the blink of an eye. “I’m sorry I couldn’t put up a better fight,” Sakkari said in her on-court interview, according to the BBC. “It was pretty quick for you guys but credit to Iga, you’re an amazing player, a very good person and an incredible champion. “You really do deserve the best. You and your team have created something incredible.

cnn,India investigates alleged Hindu nationalist attack on foreign students offering Ramadan prayers,"Mar 18, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/18/india/india-gujarat-university-attack-muslim-prayers-intl-hnk/index.html,"Authorities in western India have launched an investigation after far-right Hindus allegedly attacked foreign university students offering prayers during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, as religious tensions simmer ahead of a crucial general election. Two people were detained following clashes at the Gujarat University that broke out Saturday after students from countries including Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Tajikistan began praying on the campus grounds, Ahmedabad police said Sunday. “Around 20-25 people came and asked them why they were offering namaz (prayers) here and should instead read it in the Masjid (mosque),” Ahmedabad police commissioner GS Malik told reporters. “An argument broke out between them, stones were pelted, and their rooms were vandalized by the people from outside.” At least two foreign students were injured, according to India’s Ministry of External Affairs. “State government is taking strict action against the perpetrators,” spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal posted on social platform X. The incident is the latest in a string of communal clashes to make headlines in the democracy of 1.4 billion, which has become increasingly polarized along religious lines under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government. One eyewitness told CNN the students were offering prayers when a group of people arrived and repeatedly told them to stop, while chanting Hindu slogans. “One of the students got up and slapped a member of the group,” the Gujarat University student, who does not want to be named out of fear of retribution, told CNN. “After that, a larger group arrived and started pelting stones.” Viral video, purportedly of the incident, shows men throwing stones at the students’ hostel and damaging vehicles. In another clip, men can be heard chanting “Jai Shree Ram (Hail Lord Ram),” a Hindu slogan that has in recent years become a clarion call against Muslims. Another video appears to show a student slapping a man wearing a saffron scarf, a color associated with Hinduism. CNN cannot independently verify the videos. Speaking to regional channel News Capital Gujarat, an Afghan student said about 15 people were praying for Ramadan. “Three people came chanting ‘Jai Shree Ram,’ he said. “After a while, they came back with at least 200-250 people, pelted stones… They broke our bikes, laptops, phones… We are not safe. We request the university to shift us to a safe place.” Another student told Gujarat First News that the university had given them permission to pray on campus. Gujarat University vice chancellor Neerja A. Gupta confirmed clashes broke out between two groups after which some foreign students were injured. “An investigation is underway,” she told reporters. “Some videos have gone viral and the police is trying to investigate the trigger points.” Analysts have repeatedly raised alarm against rising intolerance in the world’s largest democracy and fear that inter-religious tensions will increase as Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) pushes its populist yet divisive policies in the lead up to a nationwide election next month. In January, communal tensions rose in western Maharashtra state, with three reported altercations between Hindus and Muslims, according to local police. In a separate incident in central Madhya Pradesh state, a group of right-wing Hindus was seen placing saffron-colored flags on top of a Christian church. Both incidents took place one week after Modi inaugurated the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, a controversial Hindu temple built on the ruins of a 16th century mosque that was destroyed by hardline Hindus some 30 years ago, setting off a wave of deadly sectarian violence not seen in India since its bloody 1947 partition. Prominent Muslim lawmaker Asaduddin Owaisi criticized Saturday’s violence in Gujarat, calling out Modi and top officials within his government. “What a shame. When your devotion & religious slogans only come out when Muslims peacefully practice their religion,” he wrote on X. “When you become unexplainably angry at the mere sight of Muslims.

cnn,Date set for largest democratic election in human history,"Mar 16, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/16/india/india-election-date-intl/index.html,"Polls in the world’s largest democracy India will open on April 19, the country’s election commissioner announced on Saturday, setting the stage for a nationwide election expected to see Prime Minister Narendra Modi clinch a rare third consecutive term. An estimated 960 million people in a country of 1.4 billion are eligible to vote in the widely anticipated polls that will take a month to complete. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is expected to secure another five years in power, ruling an India that has become increasingly polarized along religious lines. Polling will unfold over seven phases around the country ending on June 1. Indians will be voting for 543 seats in the 545-seat lower house of parliament, called the Lok Sabha, and the other two seats in the house are nominated by the president. All the votes – from the country’s 28 states and eight union territories – will be counted on June 4, the commission said at a press conference in New Delhi. Under Modi’s leadership, India is poised to become a 21st-century powerhouse as its economy rapidly expands. But the populist leader, analysts say, has tightened his grip on its democratic institutions in a way not seen since the 1970s under the iron-fisted rule of Indira Gandhi, with minorities feeling persecuted under the BJP’s Hindu-nationalist policies and dissent muzzled. Going against Modi is the main opposition Indian National Congress, which has governed the country for much of the 77 years since independence and last year formed an alliance with other parties. The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, or INDIA, marked a significant step for an opposition struggling to regain national significance. But cracks in the alliance have already emerged, and it has yet to put forward its candidate for prime minister, lacking anyone with the kind of star quality and appeal projected by Modi. The prime minister’s calendar last year included diplomatic trips to Australia and the United States, where he presented himself as a statesman cementing the country as a modern global power. In August, India made history by soft-landing a rover on the moon, becoming just the fourth nation to do so. Weeks later, it launched its first spacecraft dedicated to studying the sun. India hosted the Group of 20 (G20) in September, presenting New Delhi with an opportunity to extend its leadership beyond the country’s borders at a time of increasing political turmoil. This January, Modi marked the unofficial start of his election campaign when he inaugurated the controversial Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, a Hindu temple in the holy city of Ayodhya that was built on the site of the destroyed Babri mosque. The consecration of that temple, analysts said, marked the seismic shift from India’s secular founding values as Modi disregards the norms dividing religion from state in his push to win a third term. But it was received well in many quarters, with Modi’s followers praising the leader for his dedication to the majority Hindu faith. In 2019, Modi’s BJP won 303 seats in parliament, taking it over the threshold of 272 required for an absolute majority, dealing a humiliating blow to the Congress party. Last year, India surpassed China as the world’s most populous country. Its working-age population now stands at more than 900 million, according to 2021 data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. This number is expected to hit more than 1 billion over the next decade, according to the Indian government.

cnn,What happened when the world’s most populous nation turned off TikTok,"Mar 15, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/14/tech/india-us-tiktok-ban-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,"As TikTok fans in the United States worry about losing access to the wildly-popular social media app, there are lessons they can learn from a country on the other side of the world. On Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed a bill that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban. While the Chinese-owned app is not disappearing from Americans’ phones anytime soon, many of its 170 million users in the country are deeply rattled. But here is what they need to know: It is possible to survive and thrive in a TikTok-less world. Just ask the planet’s most populous nation. In June 2020, after a violent clash on the India-China border that left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead, the government in New Delhi suddenly banned TikTok and several other well-known Chinese apps. “It’s important to remember that when India banned TikTok and multiple Chinese apps, the US was the first to praise the decision,” said Nikhil Pahwa, the Delhi-based founder of tech website MediaNama. “[Former] US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had welcomed the ban, saying it ‘will boost India’s sovereignty.’” While India’s abrupt decision shocked the country’s 200 million TikTok users, in the four years since, many have found other suitable alternatives. “The ban on Tiktok led to the creation of a multibillion dollar opportunity … A 200 million user base needed somewhere to go,” said Pahwa, adding that it was ultimately American tech companies that seized the moment with their new offerings. The ban was not without pain. Indian TikTokkers had to grapple with confusion and even anguish in the days and months that followed. By 2020, TikTok had become hugely popular among Indians looking for relief from the pressures of strict Covid-related lockdowns. “Everyone in India wants to be a Bollywood star, and TikTok made that dream possible by making people, including those in small towns, overnight stars,” said Saptarshi Ray, head of product at Viralo, a Bengaluru-based influencer marketing platform. But it didn’t take long before other avenues for their creativity and commercial ventures sprang up. A ferocious fight ensued between US tech giants and domestic startups to fill the gap. Within a week of the ban, Meta-owned Instagram cashed in by launching its TikTok copycat, Instagram Reels, in India. Google introduced its own short video offering, YouTube Shorts. Homegrown alternatives such as MX Taka Tak and Moj also began seeing a rise in popularity and an infux in funding. Those local startups soon fizzled out, however, unable to match the reach and financial firepower of the American firms, which are flourishing. Citing independent findings from consulting firm Oxford Economics, a Google spokesperson said that “the YouTube creative ecosystem” contributed roughly $2 billion to the Indian economy in 2022. According to Ray, Indian content creators swiftly moved all the old content they had shot for TikTok to Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. “Some Influencers were uploading seven Reels a day and gaining four to five million subscribers a year,” he said. But not everyone was able to build a significant following on these platforms. “Many users and creators slipped into a deep, dark space after the ban, and some have still not emerged from that space,” said Clyde Fernandes, executive director— artist management at Opraahfx, an influencer marketing and management firm. “The way one was gaining reach and followers on TikTok is [still] incomparable to any other platform out there at the moment,” he added. US officials and lawmakers have long voiced concerns that the Chinese government could compel TikTok’s parent ByteDance to hand over data collected from American users. Cybersecurity experts say that the national security concerns surrounding TikTok remain largely hypothetical. Indian experts, however, say its purge from national digital life hasn’t resulted in a safer space. “I am not so sure removal of TikTok makes a dent in the cybersecurity threat landscape. Unless there is a step change in user awareness about the software on their phones, or what they download from the open internet, this is unlikely to change,” said Vivan Sharan, partner at Delhi-based tech policy consulting firm Koan Advisory Group. US lawmakers also fear that the app could serve as a tool for Beijing to spread propaganda, misinformation or influence Americans. The removal of TikTok hasn’t insulated Indians from those threats. “In terms of content and disinformation environment, it is plain to see we still have to grapple with serious issues like deepfakes, etc, with or without TikTok,” Sharan said. “So overall, it is hard to see which part of the risk-landscape changes significantly, assuming TikTok was certifiably problematic.”",tiktok fan united state worry losing access wildlypopular social medium app lesson learn country side world wednesday u house representative passed bill could lead nationwide tiktok ban chineseowned app disappearing american phone anytime soon many million user country deeply rattled need know possible survive thrive tiktokless world ask planet populous nation june violent clash indiachina border left least indian soldier dead government new delhi suddenly banned tiktok several wellknown chinese apps important remember india banned tiktok multiple chinese apps u first praise decision said nikhil pahwa delhibased founder tech website medianama former u secretary state mike pompeo welcomed ban saying boost india sovereignty india abrupt decision shocked country million tiktok user four year since many found suitable alternative ban tiktok led creation multibillion dollar opportunity million user base needed somewhere go said pahwa adding ultimately american tech company seized moment new offering ban without pain indian tiktokkers grapple confusion even anguish day month followed tiktok become hugely popular among indian looking relief pressure strict covidrelated lockdown everyone india want bollywood star tiktok made dream possible making people including small town overnight star said saptarshi ray head product viralo bengalurubased influencer marketing platform didnt take long avenue creativity commercial venture sprang ferocious fight ensued u tech giant domestic startup fill gap within week ban metaowned instagram cashed launching tiktok copycat instagram reel india google introduced short video offering youtube short homegrown alternative mx taka tak moj also began seeing rise popularity infux funding local startup soon fizzled however unable match reach financial firepower american firm flourishing citing independent finding consulting firm oxford economics google spokesperson said youtube creative ecosystem contributed roughly billion indian economy according ray indian content creator swiftly moved old content shot tiktok instagram reel youtube short influencers uploading seven reel day gaining four five million subscriber year said everyone able build significant following platform many user creator slipped deep dark space ban still emerged space said clyde fernandes executive director artist management opraahfx influencer marketing management firm way one gaining reach follower tiktok still incomparable platform moment added u official lawmaker long voiced concern chinese government could compel tiktoks parent bytedance hand data collected american user cybersecurity expert say national security concern surrounding tiktok remain largely hypothetical indian expert however say purge national digital life hasnt resulted safer space sure removal tiktok make dent cybersecurity threat landscape unless step change user awareness software phone download open internet unlikely change said vivan sharan partner delhibased tech policy consulting firm koan advisory group u lawmaker also fear app could serve tool beijing spread propaganda misinformation influence american removal tiktok hasnt insulated indian threat term content disinformation environment plain see still grapple serious issue like deepfakes etc without tiktok sharan said overall hard see part risklandscape change significantly assuming tiktok certifiably problematic,-15.0,negative,0

But those numbers dwindled to alarming levels, falling about 50% over the past week, according to the chairman of the city’s water supply and sewage board, V. Ram Prasat Manohar. Residents have been advised to use water sparingly – encouraged to bathe on alternate days, use disposable cutlery, and limit washing clothes and utensils. It’s a crisis that has been described as dire by those who live in Bengaluru – and experts warn it is only going to get worse as mercury levels climb in the lead up to summer. “I have been warning about this for over a decade,” said climate scientist T.V. Ramachandra, from the Centre for Ecological Sciences. “It’s a culmination of unplanned urban growth, rapid deforestation and the ongoing climate crisis – and everyone is paying the price.” For decades, Bengaluru – also known as Bangalore – had a reputation for its wide network of man-made lakes that provided water to the city’s residents. The abundance of greenery and surrounding forests, boosted by its 900-meter (nearly 3,000 feet) elevation and pleasant climate, earned it the moniker “India’s garden city.” But since the early 1990s, Bengaluru has undergone rapid urbanization, as its transformation into a major tech center resulted in exponential growth. Developers cut down the forests and built around its lakes as the city of about 4 million exploded to house more than three times that. As layers of tarmac swept through the city, Bengaluru lost its ability to absorb water, Ramachandra said. “Today 83% of Bangalore is covered in concrete,” he added. “There is no vegetation. There is no way that groundwater recharging can happen further to go to the underlying layers. This is a big problem.” Rapid urbanization and the decline of waterbodies could also worsen the impact of the climate crisis, contributing to a rise in the city’s temperatures, Ramachandra warned. More than 70% of the city’s water comes from the Cauvery River, a major waterway that flows through southern Karnataka state, of which Bengaluru is the capital. But as the city expanded, authorities didn’t have enough time to extend its network of water pipes into the new neighborhoods, with these areas relying on groundwater extracted by borewells. A weak monsoon last year depleted groundwater levels, causing a water shortage for the city’s huge population. But for about 4 million of them who rely on the borewells and live mostly on the outskirts of the city, the situation is much worse. Some 7,000 of the city’s 16,000-odd borewells have run dry, according to Bengaluru’s Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar – and experts say the focus should be on helping them. “For the 11 million people (dependent on the Cauvery River), there’s a bit of scarcity but not too much of a crisis,” said civil engineer and Bengaluru-based water researcher Vishwanathan, who goes by one name. “For the other three and a half million people who are completely dependent on groundwater, there is a crisis because groundwater is going dry.” Residents from Bandepalya, a low-income community suburb in the city’s south, line up with buckets from 9 a.m., waiting for the water tanker to arrive. Private tankers commissioned by the government distribute water to neighborhoods when river and groundwater levels run low, charging residents for the service and hiking prices when demand rises. About four hours later, as the afternoon arrives in Bandepalya, so too does the tanker. Scenes of chaos and anxiety follow as they hustle to fill their buckets and bring them home. Women try to fill two large buckets each to carry to their homes nearby. One woman begins to hit the vessel to check its water levels. The tanker is emptied within minutes. “We get water once in 15 days and have to buy water on a daily basis,” said resident Kumkum, who also goes by one name, from her home, adding that she is using bottled water to wash her children’s faces in the mornings. Kumkum’s youngest child has fallen sick with a high fever because of the crisis. “All these drums are empty and haven’t had water in them in days,” she said as she pointed to the empty buckets in her home. “We can’t wash our clothes or our utensils. We will catch rainwater just for our chores during the monsoon.” Authorities capped the price of such deliveries commissioned by the government at 1,200 rupees ($14) per tanker, but residents say they are struggling financially. Susheela, the resident with the family of four, said people in Bandepalya typically earn between 6,000 – 8,000 rupees ($70 – 95) a month, and many of them have no choice but to now spend half their income buying water from the tankers. “We are hardly bathing, using water so scarcely. But we are all struggling,” she said. Geeta Menon, a social worker who works with low-income communities in Bengaluru said the crisis could give rise to diseases and illness as hygiene levels drop. “Children are defecating on the streets as there’s no water at home, they’re going thirsty, people are unable to cook,” she said. “This is not just a short-term problem, but will have long-term repercussions if it continues.” CNN has contacted Bengaluru’s Water Supply and Sewage Board but is yet to receive a response. While the city’s poorest are bearing the brunt of Bengaluru’s water crisis, it hasn’t spared the upper middle class either. Management from many housing societies send daily updates to its residents, warning them of shortages and urging them to be careful with their water usage. One apartment complex has sent a notice to its residents saying they must reduce their water usage by 50%. “Water situation is very alarming!” the notice, seen by CNN, said. “We are hardly receiving any water through from Cauvery supply. We are fully dependable on borewell water. Out of the 11 borewells only 5 are operating. We have absolutely no way of knowing when these wells will get dry. There won’t be any notice period when it happens.” The shortage has also forced garment factories to slow production while doubling restaurant water bills, according to Reuters. Managers at some global firms are letting some employees skip meetings to collect water from the tankers, it added. The crisis has meanwhile turned into a political blame game, weeks before a national election, with India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) protesting the state’s Congress-led government for its alleged mismanagement of the situation. The main opposition Congress has claimed the BJP has not done enough at a federal level to help financially with the crisis. Yet, for the city’s residents, the tit-for-tat arguments mean little as they experience the worst of the shortages. For Maher Taj, a mother of seven, the past few weeks have been unbearable. “We have cut down how many times we use the bathrooms and take turns to bathe,” she said. “Our children are using the washrooms in their school and my husband is going at his workplace. I have reduced water usage in all aspects of life. It’s pushing my family to the limit.”",water tanker arrives every two week liter expected serve hundred people suburb india hightech metropolis woman carrying empty bucket come clamoring quench thirst

cnn,India moves to implement controversial citizenship bill that excludes Muslims,"Mar 12, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/11/asia/india-citizenship-amendment-act-bjp-intl/index.html,"India has announced rules that would allow it to implement a controversial citizenship bill that excludes Muslims. The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs announced the rules Monday, ahead of India’s general election in the spring, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will seek a rare third term in power. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act provides a fast-track to citizenship for immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan – provided they are not Muslim. The controversial law would apply to religious minorities persecuted on religious grounds, including Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians. The bill, originally passed by India’s parliament in 2019, could not come into effect until the rules were notified. Despite being well-received by Modi, a Hindu nationalist, the bill was heavily protested by opposition parties, which claimed it was unconstitutional and marginalized India’s 200-million Muslim population. Indian Home Minister Amit Shah praised Modi on Monday evening, saying he “delivered on another commitment and realized the promise of the makers of our constitution to the Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians living in those countries” in a post on X. Critics of the bill say it is another example of how Modi and Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have pushed an agenda of Hindu nationalism onto secular India, a country of 1.3 billion people, at the expense of the Muslim population. The BJP has its roots in India’s Hindu right-wing movement, many followers of which see India as a Hindu nation. Since Modi’s rise to power nearly a decade ago, critics say the once secular and democratic founding ethos of the world’s largest democracy is crumbling at an alarming speed, with minorities feeling persecuted under the BJP’s majoritarian policies and any criticism of the government facing censorship and punishment. It comes a month after two mosques were demolished in Uttarakhand state and Delhi, within days of each other, leading to clashes and local curfews. In January, Modi inaugurated a vast Hindu temple on the site of a 16th-century mosque that was destroyed by Hindu hardliners more than 30 years ago. While many Hindus celebrated the opening of the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir in Ayodhya, the inauguration was a painful reminder to the country’s minority Muslim population of the religious divisions that have grown more pronounced under Modi’s rule.",india announced rule would allow implement controversial citizenship bill excludes muslim indian ministry home affair announced rule monday ahead india general election spring prime minister narendra modi seek rare third term power citizenship amendment act provides fasttrack citizenship immigrant afghanistan bangladesh pakistan provided muslim controversial law would apply religious minority persecuted religious ground including hindu sikh buddhist jains parsi christian bill originally passed india parliament could come effect rule notified despite wellreceived modi hindu nationalist bill heavily protested opposition party claimed unconstitutional marginalized india million muslim population indian home minister amit shah praised modi monday evening saying delivered another commitment realized promise maker constitution hindu sikh buddhist jains parsi christian living country post x critic bill say another example modi hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party bjp pushed agenda hindu nationalism onto secular india country billion people expense muslim population bjp root india hindu rightwing movement many follower see india hindu nation since modis rise power nearly decade ago critic say secular democratic founding ethos world largest democracy crumbling alarming speed minority feeling persecuted bjps majoritarian policy criticism government facing censorship punishment come month two mosque demolished uttarakhand state delhi within day leading clash local curfew january modi inaugurated vast hindu temple site thcentury mosque destroyed hindu hardliner year ago many hindu celebrated opening ram janmabhoomi mandir ayodhya inauguration painful reminder country minority muslim population religious division grown pronounced modis rule,-7.0,negative,2
cnn,Maldives signs China military pact in further shift away from India,"Mar 6, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/05/asia/maldives-china-military-assistance-pact-india-intl-hnk/index.html,"Maldives on Tuesday said China will provide it with “military assistance,” in the latest sign that the Indian Ocean archipelago’s pro-China shift is well under way following the election of President Mohamed Muizzu last year. The Maldivian Defense Ministry said it signed an agreement with Beijing Monday “on China’s provision of military assistance” and that the deal would foster “stronger bilateral ties,” according to a post on social media site X. Details of what the assistance would entail were not released but the ministry said the deal was “gratis” — or given for free. The move is part of a push by President Muizzu since taking office in November to develop closer relations with China, following his “India Out” election campaign that promised to remove Indian troops from Maldivian soil and reassert “lost” national sovereignty. In January, Muizzu set a deadline of March 15 for the complete withdrawal of Indian military personnel stationed in the archipelago nation, according to the president’s office. An update from his office last month said negotiations had agreed troops would leave in stages, with the first withdrawing before March 10 and the rest before May 10. According to Reuters, there are 77 Indian soldiers and 12 medical personnel from the Indian armed forces in Maldives. India has also given Maldives two helicopters and a Dornier aircraft, which are mainly used for marine surveillance, search and rescue operations and medical evacuations, Reuters reported. The new deal with China marks a significant shift in Maldives’ foreign policy from Muizzu’s pro-India predecessor, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih. The tiny South Asian nation is regarded internationally as a tourist destination popular for its white sand beaches and turquoise lagoons. But the archipelago of nearly 1,200 low-lying coral islands, with a population of fewer than half a million people, spreads over a swathe of strategically important waters and shipping lanes in the Indian Ocean. Given their geographic proximity and strong historic and economic ties, India was for decades Maldives’ closest partner and New Delhi viewed the region as part of its traditional sphere of influence. But Maldives has long found itself in the middle of a geopolitical tussle with both India and China vying for influence. China has increasingly expanded its footprint in Maldives, most visibly through large-scale infrastructure projects such as the $200 million China-Maldives Friendship Bridge. Analysts have previously told CNN that a Chinese presence in Maldives could affect Indian security, given the island chain’s proximity to India’s western coast. In January, Muizzu traveled to Beijing for a state visit and the two countries signed 20 agreements that included cooperation on infrastructure, trade, economy, green development, grants, and other development projects. That includes about $127 million in aid to develop roads in the capital Male and build 30,000 social housing units, according to a news release from the president’s office. During the trip, Muizzu hailed China as “one of the closest allies and developmental partners of Maldives.” China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters Tuesday that Beijing is “committed to working with the Maldives to build a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership.” “Normal cooperation between China and the Maldives does not target any third party and will not be disrupted by any third party,” she said. In his presidential address on February 5, Muizzu said Maldives must fortify its military capabilities and its defense force was about to achieve round-the-clock surveillance capabilities over the nation’s 900,000 square kilometer Exclusive Economic Zone. The government will also not renew an agreement that enables foreign countries to measure and map the oceans and coasts of Maldives, he said.",maldives tuesday said china provide military assistance latest sign indian ocean archipelago prochina shift well way following election president mohamed muizzu last year maldivian defense ministry said signed agreement beijing monday china provision military assistance deal would foster stronger bilateral tie according post social medium site x detail assistance would entail released ministry said deal gratis given free move part push president muizzu since taking office november develop closer relation china following india election campaign promised remove indian troop maldivian soil reassert lost national sovereignty january muizzu set deadline march complete withdrawal indian military personnel stationed archipelago nation according president office update office last month said negotiation agreed troop would leave stage first withdrawing march rest may according reuters indian soldier medical personnel indian armed force maldives india also given maldives two helicopter dornier aircraft mainly used marine surveillance search rescue operation medical evacuation reuters reported new deal china mark significant shift maldives foreign policy muizzus proindia predecessor ibrahim mohamed solih tiny south asian nation regarded internationally tourist destination popular white sand beach turquoise lagoon archipelago nearly lowlying coral island population fewer half million people spread swathe strategically important water shipping lane indian ocean given geographic proximity strong historic economic tie india decade maldives closest partner new delhi viewed region part traditional sphere influence maldives long found middle geopolitical tussle india china vying influence china increasingly expanded footprint maldives visibly largescale infrastructure project million chinamaldives friendship bridge analyst previously told cnn chinese presence maldives could affect indian security given island chain proximity india western coast january muizzu traveled beijing state visit two country signed agreement included cooperation infrastructure trade economy green development grant development project includes million aid develop road capital male build social housing unit according news release president office trip muizzu hailed china one closest ally developmental partner maldives china foreign ministry spokesperson mao ning told reporter tuesday beijing committed working maldives build comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership normal cooperation china maldives target third party disrupted third party said presidential address february muizzu said maldives must fortify military capability defense force achieve roundtheclock surveillance capability nation square kilometer exclusive economic zone government also renew agreement enables foreign country measure map ocean coast maldives said,22.0,positive,0
cnn,Seven men arrested in India for alleged gang-rape of tourist,"Mar 6, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/05/asia/india-gang-rape-arrest-intl/index.html,"Seven men are now in custody in India for the alleged gang-rape of a tourist and assault on her husband, authorities said, in a case that has shone a new spotlight on the endemic problem of sexual violence against women in the country. On Saturday, police announced that three men had been arrested in connection with the incident and that they were seeking four more. Dumka Deputy Commissioner Anjaneyulu Dodde confirmed to CNN Tuesday that four further suspects had now been detained. The couple, who had been traveling by motorcycle from the state of West Bengal to neighboring Nepal, were found late Friday by police officers on patrol, said Pitambar Singh Kherwar, superintendent of Dumka district police in Jharkhand state. They were taken to the hospital, where the woman told the doctor she had been raped, he said. Police have formed a special investigative team, Kherwar said. It is unclear whether the suspects have legal representation. CNN is not naming the female victim, in accordance with Indian law that prevents the naming of victims of sexual violence. Police have not disclosed the names or nationalities of the couple. The arrests come after a travel vlogger couple on Saturday posted on their Instagram account that they had “knives (held) to our throats,” during an attack in India. The woman had been raped and brought to the hospital for DNA testing, they said. The couple posts in Spanish, and the woman says on her Instagram page that she is Brazilian. On their Instagram story, the woman showed bruises on her face, saying, “This is what my face looks like, but it isn’t what hurts the most. I thought I was going to die.” In a follow-up post Sunday, the couple thanked their followers for their support, saying they are doing well and that “the police is doing everything possible to catch” the remaining suspects. CNN has reached out to the couple for comment. India’s National Commission for Women (NCW) condemned the alleged attack. NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma has spoken to the victim and extended all required assistance, the organization posted on social platform X on Saturday. Jharkhand minister Mithilesh Kumar Thakur called the alleged assault a “condemnable incident.” “If a crime has been committed, the culprits will not be spared,” he said on Saturday. India has struggled for years to tackle high rates of violence against women, with a number of high-profile rape cases involving foreign visitors drawing international attention to the issue. In 2018, A British woman was allegedly raped while walking to her hotel in the western state of Goa, a popular tourist destination; two years earlier, an American woman was allegedly drugged and raped by a group of men in her five-star hotel room in New Delhi. And in 2013, six men were sentenced to life in prison for the gang rape of a Swiss tourist. According to India’s National Crime Records Bureau, a total of 31,516 rape cases were recorded in 2022, an average of 86 cases per day. And experts warn that the number of cases recorded are just a small fraction of what may be the real number, in a deeply patriarchal country where shame and stigma surround rape victims and their families.",seven men custody india alleged gangrape tourist assault husband authority said case shone new spotlight endemic problem sexual violence woman country saturday police announced three men arrested connection incident seeking four dumka deputy commissioner anjaneyulu dodde confirmed cnn tuesday four suspect detained couple traveling motorcycle state west bengal neighboring nepal found late friday police officer patrol said pitambar singh kherwar superintendent dumka district police jharkhand state taken hospital woman told doctor raped said police formed special investigative team kherwar said unclear whether suspect legal representation cnn naming female victim accordance indian law prevents naming victim sexual violence police disclosed name nationality couple arrest come travel vlogger couple saturday posted instagram account knife held throat attack india woman raped brought hospital dna testing said couple post spanish woman say instagram page brazilian instagram story woman showed bruise face saying face look like isnt hurt thought going die followup post sunday couple thanked follower support saying well police everything possible catch remaining suspect cnn reached couple comment india national commission woman ncw condemned alleged attack ncw chairperson rekha sharma spoken victim extended required assistance organization posted social platform x saturday jharkhand minister mithilesh kumar thakur called alleged assault condemnable incident crime committed culprit spared said saturday india struggled year tackle high rate violence woman number highprofile rape case involving foreign visitor drawing international attention issue british woman allegedly raped walking hotel western state goa popular tourist destination two year earlier american woman allegedly drugged raped group men fivestar hotel room new delhi six men sentenced life prison gang rape swiss tourist according india national crime record bureau total rape case recorded average case per day expert warn number case recorded small fraction may real number deeply patriarchal country shame stigma surround rape victim family,-85.0,negative,2

Featuring performances from pop superstar Rihanna and magician David Blaine, the three-day celebration welcomed around 1,200 guests from Silicon Valley, Bollywood and beyond, with cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar and actor Shah Rukh Khan among the many Indian celebrities pictured in attendance. Ambani is the youngest son of Asia’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, who has an estimated fortune of $117 billion, according to Forbes. The 28-year-old serves as a director at an energy business operated by Reliance, the Indian conglomerate founded by his grandfather. Although Ambani and his 29-year-old girlfriend Radhika Merchant are not due to marry until July, no expense was spared at the lavish pre-wedding bash. Guests were served 500 dishes created by around 100 chefs, according to Reuters, which saw a copy of a planning document provided to invitees. The weekend’s festivities took place in Jamnagar, in the western state of Gujarat, close to Reliance’s main oil refinery. The city’s airport, which typically handles fewer than 10 flights a day, reported a surge in activity. In a post on X Saturday, airport authorities said around 130 flights had arrived for the extravaganza. Chartered jets from New Delhi and Mumbai were made available to guests, Reuters said, as were the services of hair stylists, makeup artists and drapists. The charitable arm of the Ambani’s family business, the Reliance Foundation, said that weavers had been deployed to produce “a tapestry of dreams” for the nuptials, while visually impaired artisans had been hired to make candles for guests. A new Hindu temple complex is being built specifically for the wedding and will later be opened to the public, the NGO added.

cnn,"Angry farmers once forced India’s hardline leader into a rare retreat. As the election looms, they’re back","Feb 27, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/27/india/india-farmers-protest-modi-opposition-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,"Just over two years after they strongarmed Prime Minister Narendra Modi into an exceptional U-turn, India’s protesting farmers are back on the streets – and this time the stakes are higher. For about two weeks now, thousands of angry farmers have gathered at the borders of India’s capital to demand higher fixed prices for their crops, just weeks before a nationwide election that is expected to see Modi clinch a rare third term in power. A heavy security presence has so far prevented the farmers from marching on New Delhi and violent clashes have seen police fire tear gas and water cannons. Tensions rose further last week after the death of a protester near the Punjab border, according to the state’s chief minister, who has ordered a probe into the case. The scene is reminiscent of 2021, when in a rare break from his uncompromising leadership style, Modi repealed controversial laws aimed at modernizing the agricultural sector following more than a year of mass farmers’ protests. Modi promised “a fresh start,” agreeing to meet the farmers’ demands and work with them to move forward. But the farmers say those promises were broken, and this time, they will not return home until their demands are met. The confrontation, analysts say, has sewn apprehension in the highest echelons of Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is wary of antagonizing the farmers – one of the country’s most influential voting blocs – ahead of an expected May election. With the BJP facing a fractured opposition that is yet to present a clear candidate for prime minister, the farmers have emerged as the strongest threat to the ruling party, some analysts say. And if protests grow closer to the scale seen in 2021, it could become a bigger issue for Modi. “Right now, it looks like there is only one opposition – the farmers,” said economist Devinder Sharma. “Politics is unpredictable, but it is very important for the unions and the government to come to a solution.” Sangha Gurpreet remembers the day he abandoned his field for a protest site in November 2020, watching as it swelled in size over the next year. “I was part of that struggle for 13 months,” the activist and farmer said of the historic protests that jolted Indian society and started a nationwide discussion about the country’s agriculture workers. Those protests began after the BJP introduced three new laws it insisted would fix a system plagued with problems. The farming laws aimed to loosen the rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce that protected farmers from an unfettered free market for decades. But farmers said market forces could push prices even lower, and smaller farmers would find it hard to negotiate favorable deals with corporate giants. Gurpreet was among hundreds of thousands of farmers from India’s northern states – Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh – that demanded the dismissal of the laws. They stayed on the streets through a harsh winter, scorching summer and a global pandemic until Modi finally backed down and promised to work with them to come to an agreement. It was a massive victory for the farmers, who pushed the Indian leader into a rare and uncharacteristic climbdown. And Gurpreet says they are prepared to do it again. “This is not about new demands. These were given to the government and have either already been agreed to in writing, promised in their election manifesto, or announced in public speeches,” he said. “There was nothing left for us to do but come onto the roads and request the government to give us what we want.” CNN has contacted the BJP for comment but has yet to receive a response. Agriculture Minister Arjun Munda, who has held talks with protest leaders, previously told reporters the government believes a “peaceful” solution will be found soon. Agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for about 55% of India’s 1.4 billion citizens, according to the India Brand Equity Foundation, a trust established by the country’s Department of Commerce to promote Indian products and services. Only China produces more rice, wheat, cotton, groundnuts, fruits and vegetables than India. Only Brazil produces more sugarcane. But farming households made an average income of just 10,218 rupees ($137) per month in 2018-19, according to latest government statistics – 316 rupees below the nation’s average salary that year. Farmers are demanding a higher and guaranteed minimum support price (MSP) for all the crops they grow, to give them more financial stability and control over their income. Sharma, the economist, says a guaranteed MSP is necessary to protect farmers against fluctuations in prices, adding most agricultural workers don’t till enough land to yield a profit, leading to debilitating debts. The abject poverty and debt faced by many of India’s farmers has forced some to take extreme measures. In 2022, more than 11,000 people in the agricultural sector ended their own lives, according to government data. “About 86% of Indian farmers are dependent on the markets. If the markets were so benevolent, I see no reason why farmers should be protesting every now and then,” Sharma said. “It’s very tragic that the people who feed the country have to sleep with hungry stomachs themselves.” Modi must tread carefully to ensure the farmers are placated, analysts say, as he prepares to head to the polls in a few weeks’ time. The prime minister’s 2021 reversal on the farming laws “came as quite a surprise to everybody,” said Arati Jerath, a political commentator based in New Delhi, and proved the farmers can stand up to the government. “It was actually a very, very big moment for the BJP,” she said. Throughout his decade in power, Modi has positioned himself as a leader capable of making strong decisions, impervious to critique. For example, he stood by his decision to ban most of India’s paper money in 2016, after deeming certain banknotes to be “worthless pieces of paper.” Three years later, he faced the fury of protesters after introducing the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act, which promised to fast-track Indian citizenship for all religious faiths from neighboring Muslim-majority Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan – except Islam. Most recently in January, he inaugurated a Hindu temple built on the ruins of a destroyed mosque in a move that polarized opinion in the country. But as the farm protests spread across states in 2021, Jerath said Modi had no choice but to back down. “Farmers are a large constituency in India, and I think no political party cannot afford to have debates,” she said. This time, Modi’s government has engaged with farmers’ unions much quicker, already holding multiple rounds of talks in an effort to reach an agreement to end the protests. But there are signs of trepidation within the BJP. Roads leading to New Delhi are heavily guarded by security personnel to block farmers from entering the capital, while police have been accused by farmers’ unions of being heavy handed with the protesters, accusations they deny. The government has meanwhile ordered X, formerly Twitter, to block the social media handles of dozens of farmers, including Gurpreet. “The Indian government has issued executive orders requiring X to act on specific accounts and posts, subject to potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment,” X said in a statement. Jerath said while the protests have not yet swelled in size to 2021 levels, there is “anxiety” within the BJP about what might happen next. “Right now, the farmers may not impact the election outcome,” she said. But the government “will not want these protests to spread,” she added. “It’s really a war of nerves going on between the farmers and the government.”",two year strongarmed prime minister narendra

cnn,‘India has arrived.’ Why Modi’s economy offers a real alternative to China,"Feb 27, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/26/business/modi-india-economy-growth-optimism-hnk-intl/index.html,"For the last three decades, Peeyush Mittal has frequently driven the 185 miles from the Indian capital to the city of Jaipur. The journey always took him six hours. “For 30 years there’s been this promise of doing that journey in three hours. It has never been possible,” said Mittal, a portfolio manager at Matthews Asia, a San Francisco-based investment fund. “They’ve expanded the highway, gone from one lane to two lane to three lane, everything has been done. But that journey has always remained six hours.” Except last year, when he cruised at 75 miles per hour on a new expressway connecting the two cities, and made the trip in half the time. “My jaw dropped when I first time got on that highway. I was like, ‘Wow, man, how is this even possible … in India?” he said. The quality of India’s new infrastructure is just one of many reasons why Mittal, who manages funds focussed on emerging markets, and other investors are excited about the country’s growth prospects. Financial professionals around the world are noticing India’s development since 2014 under two-term Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has said he wants the South Asian nation to become a $5 trillion economy by 2025. The optimism around the world’s most populous nation is in stark contrast to the mood found in China, which is grappling with a myriad of economic challenges, including an accelerated flight of capital from the country. Its stock markets have suffered a protracted slump since recent peaks in 2021, with more than $5 trillion in market value having been wiped out from the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong bourses. Foreign direct investment (FDI) plunged last year, and fell again in January, down nearly 12% compared to the same month in 2023. India’s stock market, meanwhile, is hitting record highs. The value of companies listed on India’s exchanges surpassed $4 trillion late last year. The future appears even brighter. India’s market value is expected to more than double to $10 trillion by 2030, according to a Thursday report by Jefferies, which would make it “impossible for large global investors to ignore.” “China is a no go, so … which is the other country that can maybe replace China?” said Mittal. “There’s no country like China other than India … in some form or fashion, it is the substitute that maybe the world is looking for to drive growth.” Japan has benefited from investors seeking an alternative to China — Tokyo’s benchmark index hit a new high for the first time in 34 years last week, helped by improving corporate profits and a weak yen. But the country is stuck in recession and recently lost its position as the world’s third biggest economy to Germany. The latest revision by global stock index compiler MSCI reflects the bullishness towards India. MSCI said this month that it would increase India’s weighting in its emerging markets index to 18.06% from 17.98%, while reducing China’s to 24.77%. MSCI’s indexes help institutional investors worldwide decide how to allocate money and where to focus their research. “India’s weight in the MSCI emerging market index was about 7% a couple of years back,” said Aditya Suresh, head of India equity research at Macquarie Capital. “Do I think that 18% [in the MSCI index] is naturally gravitating more towards 25%? Yeah, that’s kind of clearly where our conversations are leading us to believe.” As India heads towards national elections in the coming months, market watchers are hoping that Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party wins a third term, bringing greater predictability to economic policies for the next five years. “If Modi is back with a majority and political stability is there, then I can certainly say with confidence that there’ll be a lot more investor interest in India on a more sustainable basis,” said Mittal. There are good reasons for the euphoria around India. From a surging young population to humming factories, the country has a lot going in its favor. The International Monetary Fund expects India to grow by 6.5% next financial year compared to 4.6% for China.  Analysts at Jefferies expect the country to become the world’s third largest economy by 2027. Much like China more than three decades ago, India is only at the beginning of a infrastructure transformation, spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. There is a “very strong multiplier effect” on the economy from the investments in digital and physical infrastructure, which “you cannot roll back,” Suresh said. The world’s fastest growing major economy is also trying to capitalize on the rethink underway among companies on supply chains. Global businesses want to diversify operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are exposed to risks arising from tension between Beijing and Washington. “India is a prime candidate to benefit from the ‘friend-shoring’ of supply chains, notably at the expense of China,” wrote Hubert de Barochez, a market economist at Capital Economics, in January. As a result, some of the world’s biggest companies, including Apple (AAPL) supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations in India. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said last June his company is looking to invest in India “as soon as humanly possible.” “[Modi] really cares about India because he’s pushing us to make significant investments in India, which is something we intend to do,” Musk told reporters. But some worry that India’s confidence may be bordering on hubris. While interest in the world’s fifth largest economy is rising, the lofty prices of India’s stocks are scaring some international investors away. Indian shares have always been expensive compared to other emerging economies, said Suresh, but now “the premium on the premium has expanded.” Domestic investors, both retail and institutional, seem to be brushing aside these high valuations, driving India’s stock market to unprecedented peaks. According to Macquarie, retail investors alone own 9% of India’s equity market value versus foreign investors at slightly under 20%. Analysts, however, expect foreign investments to pick up in the second half of 2024, once the election is out of the way. There’s another potential challenge. Despite its new economic swagger, India does not have the capacity to absorb all the money that is flowing out of China, whose economy is still about five times bigger. China “has a few too many companies which are $100 and $200 billion plus [in value],” Mittal said. “It is difficult to find home for that kind of chunk of money in India.” But the fact that India’s sizzling rally is driven by domestic investors adds to the country’s strengths and reduces its dependence on foreign fund flows. “It just massively insulates India from global dynamics,” Suresh said. Apart from geopolitical rifts and an uncertain economic outlook, foreign companies and investors have grown increasingly wary of domestic political risks in China, including the possibility of raids and detentions. Institutional investors are still very wary about buying Chinese stocks, even though many now look like a bargain. “There are many good businesses in China, but with all the regulatory issues it becomes very difficult to predict what they will look like in the long run,” said Priyanka Agnihotri, portfolio manager at Baltimore-based Brown Advisory. India, on the other hand, enjoys healthy relations with the West and other major economies, and is aggressively wooing large firms to set up factories in the country. In her budget speech in February, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said FDI inflows since Modi first came to power in 2014 stood at nearly $600 billion, which is twice the amount during the previous decade. “For encouraging sustained foreign investment, we are negotiating bilateral investment treaties with our foreign partners, in the spirit of first develop India,” she added. Analysts say that it would hard to stop the economic juggernaut India has set in motion, irrespective of what happens to China. “Even if China comes back to the table and resolves a lot of problems, I don’t think India is going back into the background anymore,” said Mittal. “It has arrived.”",last three decade peeyush mittal frequently driven mile indian capital city jaipur journey always took six

cnn,‘Erasing a part of history’ – What a double mosque demolition tells us about India ahead of crucial election,"Feb 15, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/15/india/india-mosque-demolitions-religious-divide-intl-hnk/index.html,"The demolition of two mosques in India within days of each other has highlighted the deep religious divide in the country, months before voters head to the polls for a nationwide election that is expected to hand Prime Minister Narendra Modi a rare third term in power. The twin demolitions in Uttarakhand state and Delhi came just weeks after Modi inaugurated the controversial Ram Mandir, a temple built on the foundations of a centuries-old mosque that was torn down by hardline Hindu crowds in the early 1990s. That ceremony marked a seismic shift away from modern India’s secular founding principles and was hailed by Hindu nationalists as a crowning moment in their decades-long campaign to reshape the nation. Deadly violence erupted in Uttarakhand’s Haldwani city last week, after government officials, accompanied by police, razed a mosque and madrassa (an Islamic school), citing “illegal encroachment.” But advocates working on behalf of the Muslim community point to court documents, seen by CNN, that show no such order had been given. The demolitions drew incensed residents onto the streets and at least six people have been killed in clashes with police. Authorities have imposed curfews, but scared Muslim families told CNN they just want to leave. About a third of Haldwani’s 220,000 people are Muslim, according to the most recent census from 2011. Pushkar Dhami, Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, said his government will take strict action against “rioters and miscreants.” “Every rioter who indulged in arson and stone pelting is being identified, no miscreant who disturbs harmony and peace will be spared,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The clashes come one week after another madrassa, a centuries-old mosque, a Sufi shrine and dozens of Muslim graves were demolished by government authorities in Delhi, also for alleged “illegal encroachment,” prompting anger and outrage in the Indian capital. Analysts say these incidents underscore an uncomfortable reality in the world’s largest democracy and fear that inter-religious tensions will increase as Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continue to push their populist, yet divisive, policies in the lead up to a nationwide election in just a few months’ time. The image of India that Modi wants to project is one of a confident, vibrant, and modern superpower. But many of the country’s 230 million Muslims say they are being sidelined and marginalized in the world’s largest democracy. “This is the worst possible time to be a Muslim in India,” said author Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, adding that it has “become normal to demolish mosques in India.” “The stigmatization of Muslims is an old story, seen as the new normal. No longer does it shock people.” CNN has reached out to the BJP but is yet to receive a response. The mosque demolitions come against a backdrop of increased religious polarization and accusations that the BJP is building a Hindu-first state in what is constitutionally meant to be a secular country. They follow the opening of the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir in Ayodhya, a controversial Hindu temple built on the ruins of a 16th century mosque that was destroyed by hardline Hindus some 30 years ago, setting off a wave of deadly sectarian violence not seen in India since its bloody 1947 partition. Modi presided over a lavish consecration ceremony, where he played the role of a priest and hailed the beginning of a “new divine India.” But his vision is a far cry from the ideas of the modern country’s founding fathers, analysts say. And during his decade in power, Modi’s BJP has isolated millions among India’s sizable minorities, analysts say. Modi rose to power in 2014 with a pledge to reform India’s economy and usher in a new era of development – but he and his party also heavily pushed a Hindutva agenda, an ideology that believes India is inherently a land meant for Hindus. About 80% of India’s 1.4 billion people are Hindu, but the country is home to a diverse group of religions and faiths, including Sikhs, Buddhists and one of the world’s largest Muslim populations of some 230 million. When he stood for reelection in 2019, Modi’s Hindutva policies became more brazen, according to analysts. A few months after winning, he announced he was stripping the statehood of India’s only Muslim-majority territory, Jammu and Kashmir, and turning it into two union territories while bringing it under federal control. And earlier this month, the BJP-ruled state of Uttarakhand became the first in independent India to pass the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), a set of contentious common laws that have been criticized by some minority groups for trying to replace their personal religious laws. In India, a country of diverse faiths, religious groups follow their own laws for matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance. But these have long been considered by some to be regressive, including by many more secular figures. The BJP’s attempt to reform these religious laws is seen by some as a welcome move, but critics fear the government’s Hindu nationalist policies could unduly influence the legislation. Asaduddin Owaisi, a Muslim opposition lawmaker, criticized the law, saying it forces Muslims to follow a different religion. “I have a right to practice my religion and culture, this Bill forces me to follow a different religion and culture,” he wrote on X. “In our religion, inheritance and marriage are part of religious practice.” Earlier this month, a report from Amnesty International said between April and June 2022, a total of 128 properties largely belonging to Muslims across five states were bulldozed by government authorities. “The demolitions adversely impacted at least 617 people, including men, women, and children, either rendering them homeless or deprived of their sole livelihood,” the report said. Author Mukhopadhyay added: “It is a 360 degree Islamophobic campaign that is going on in every sphere of life.” A sense of despair among many Muslims lingers in Delhi’s Mehrauli district, where government authorities razed the 600-year-old Akhondji Mosque to the ground late last month. Late last month, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) – the governing body operating under India’s ruling BJP – bulldozed the structure, alleging “illegal encroachment.” But Mohammed Zakir Hussain, the mosque’s 40-year-old cleric, says the building was under the control of the city’s Waqf Board, a statutory body established to protect Islamic affairs, and should never have been destroyed. He felt “helpless” as he pleaded with authorities to stop tearing the building to the ground, he said. The DDA’s lawyer Sanjay Katyal told the Delhi High Court that the body had bought the land for planned development.The case is expected to be heard again later this month. Delhi, a metropolis of more than 20 million people, has seen rapid urbanization over the past few decades, with a vast, modern metro system, and a burgeoning middle class that has come to symbolize India’s economic growth. But between its meandering roads stand centuries-old monuments and medieval ruins that put the Indian capital on a par with the world’s great ancient cities, historians say. Historian Rana Safvi said the architecture of the Akhondji Mosque was typical of the Sultanate era, which flourished in India between 1192 and 1526. Its arched roof and pillars of grey stone had stood for some 600 years before it was torn to the ground. “It is like erasing a part of Indian history,” Safvi said. “It is a loss of a mosque, a safe place for one to congregate to pray, especially at a time when namaz in the open or in public areas is frowned upon.” And along with the mosque, authorities also broke down the Islamic school that housed dozens of children, including orphans, and destroyed an old graveyard that stood beside it. Mohammad Arif, 22, whose father, grandmother and grandfather’s graves are among those ruined, said he arrives at the site every day to try and restore what’s left of it. “I come here every day to ask (the guards) to let me go inside and put mud to restore their graves at least. They do not allow it,” he said. Mohammad Aman, 32, mourned the deepening divide between Hindus and Muslims. “(The government) rationalizes everything by blaming Mughal emperors,” he said, referring to India’s ancient Islamic rulers. “But you’re doing the same thing now. What is the difference between you and him then?”",demolition two mosque india within day highlighted deep religious divide country month voter head poll nationwide election expected hand prime

cnn,"Paytm, once India’s hottest startup, sees its stock fall 80% since market debut","Feb 5, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/tech/paytm-india-rbi-intl-hnk/index.html,"Paytm, once the hottest of India’s startups, has seen a stunning fall on the stock market since last week, extending a plunge that has wiped nearly 80% off its value since it went public in the country’s biggest IPO in 2021. Shares of the hugely popular digital payments company have crashed by the daily maximum allowed in Mumbai for three days in a row as of Monday, even though India’s stock markets have been touching new all-time highs. Paytm is down 42% since Wednesday’s close of trading and is almost 32% lower this year. The company has struggled since its disastrous market debut in November 2021, when it failed to convince investors that it could become profitable in the face of growing competition from homegrown rivals and American tech firms. It also landed in hot water with regulators — two years ago, the central bank barred its banking arm from signing up new customers. Paytm stock is now trading at just 438 rupees (around $5) a share. The crash over the past two days has wiped out $2.4 billion in market capitalization alone, leaving the company worth just $3.3 billion. The latest plunge came after India’s central bank cracked down further on its business. The Reserve bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday ordered Paytm Payments Bank to stop taking deposits, along with other key services, citing “persistent non-compliances.” Since the notice, which caught India’s tech community by surprise, Paytm has swung into fire-fighting mode to try to calm investors and its 300 million-plus customers. But its assurance that it is taking “immediate steps” to comply with regulators as well as a conference call held after market hours on Thursday have failed to stop the meltdown. The RBI order is a “reputational risk to the overall Paytm business and casts doubt over the visibility of [its] business performance in future,” said Manish Chowdhury, head of research at brokerage StoxBox. Paytm launched its payments bank in 2017 as a joint venture with founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma. At that time, it could accept deposits but not lend money to customers. In the Thursday call, Sharma said the central bank’s action “is more of a speed bump,” and that going forward Paytm will work only with other banks. The company also denied media reports it is being investigated for money laundering by India’s financial crime fighting agency. “Neither the company nor its founder and CEO are being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate,” it said in a filing on Sunday. “In the past, certain merchants/users on our platforms have been subject to enquiries and on those occasions, we have always cooperated with the authorities.” Paytm’s app became a household name in the country in 2016, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi suddenly banned the country’s two biggest currency notes — around 86% of the country’s cash at the time — with the aim of cracking down on tax evasion and illegal wealth. The move was hugely disruptive for the economy, but it helped Paytm grow at an explosive rate: The company signed 10 million new users within a month. It made us “a folklore name in this country,” Sharma told CNN in 2019.",paytm hottest india startup seen stunning fall stock market since last week extending plunge wiped nearly value since went public country biggest ipo share hugely popular digital payment company crashed daily maximum allowed mumbai three day row monday even though india stock market touching new alltime high paytm since wednesday close trading almost lower year company struggled since disastrous market debut november failed convince investor could become profitable face growing competition homegrown rival american tech firm also landed hot water regulator two year ago central bank barred banking arm signing new customer paytm stock trading rupee around share crash past two day wiped billion market capitalization alone leaving company worth billion latest plunge came india central bank cracked business reserve bank india rbi wednesday ordered paytm payment bank stop taking deposit along key service citing persistent noncompliance since notice caught india tech community surprise paytm swung firefighting mode try calm investor millionplus customer assurance taking immediate step comply regulator well conference call held market hour thursday failed stop meltdown rbi order reputational risk overall paytm business cast doubt visibility business performance future said manish chowdhury head research brokerage stoxbox paytm launched payment bank joint venture founder vijay shekhar sharma time could accept deposit lend money customer thursday call sharma said central bank action speed bump going forward paytm work bank company also denied medium report investigated money laundering india financial crime fighting agency neither company founder ceo investigated enforcement directorate said filing sunday past certain merchantsusers platform subject enquiry occasion always cooperated authority paytms app became household name country indian prime minister narendra modi suddenly banned country two biggest currency note around country cash time aim cracking tax evasion illegal wealth move hugely disruptive economy helped paytm grow explosive rate company signed million new user within month made u folklore name country sharma told cnn,-8.0,negative,0
cnn,Opinion: India’s ‘murder most foul’ has a chilling subtext,"Jan 31, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/opinions/india-fridge-murder-women-shraddha-singh/index.html,"In recent weeks, India has been gripped by the ghastly murder cases of two women. Yet again, however, the breathless media coverage has lost sight of a bigger picture. The murder of 26-year-old Shraddha Walkar has made front page news across the country on account of its gruesome nature. According to police, Walkar’s partner Aftab Poonawala strangled her, cut her body into pieces and stored them in his fridge, before scattering them across parts of New Delhi. Poonawala confessed in court to killing Walkar, reportedly claiming he acted “in the heat of the moment.” Since the case came to light, Indian media has prodded it from every possible angle, including using the couple’s different faiths to fuel a “love jihad” narrative – the right-wing conspiracy theory that Hindu women are “lured” into relationships by Muslim men. No stone has been left unturned in the click-bait coverage. Poonawala was apparently “inspired by” the TV series “Dexter,” which features a forensic specialist who moonlights as a serial killer. And the couple met on Bumble, a popular dating app. A subsequent piece covered the case from this angle, noting that the murder has prompted women to delete dating apps while “experts blame [these] platforms.” As a single woman, and as a journalist, these brash, un-nuanced takes are incredibly frustrating to read. Why is the onus of women’s safety solely on women? Why is it so easy to name and blame everything except the obvious? The issue here is not with the apps, or with the TV series, but with India’s deeply patriarchal society, which offers women little to no agency. It is against this backdrop that violent murderers like Poonawala emerge. Walkar had previously flagged concerns for her safety with the Mumbai Police in 2020, but withdrew her initial complaint on a follow-up police visit. While such actions are not uncommon among victims of intimate partner violence, this aspect of the case – that Walkar was allegedly already a victim of intimate partner violence – has been overshadowed by more sensationalist narratives. According to the British Medical Journal, one in three Indian women is likely to have been subjected to intimate partner violence. But only one in 10 of these women officially report it. India is not alone. Globally, according to UN chief António Guterres, every 11 minutes, a woman or girl is killed by an intimate partner or family member. Other similar – equally gory – cases have made recent headlines in India too. Aayushi Chaudhary, a 21-year-old Indian woman, was reportedly found murdered with her body stuffed in a suitcase. Police have arrested her parents reportedly in connection to a suspected “honor killing,” a term used to describe murders where the victim has brought “shame” to their family, typically by choosing to marry outside their faith or caste. In India, honor killings claimed 145 lives between 2017 and 2019, according to the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs (the actual number is believed to be higher). But all these stories point to the same underlying issue: control over women through patriarchy. If it takes gruesome headlines to start a conversation about violence against women, how are we ever going to address the role men play in perpetrating this violence? How are we going to discuss the ways violence fluctuates along lines of class, sexual orientation or caste? (In India, 54% of Dalit women, the group of people most oppressed by centuries old caste hierarchy, reported being physically assaulted and 23% reported being raped.) Will we ever be able to address the minutiae of aggressions women face in the workplace? Even as a single woman with a fair amount of privilege, I’m constantly bewildered by the road bumps I face living in India. When I moved to Mumbai over four years ago, I was shocked at how difficult it was to find and rent a flat because I was single. “The landlord’s saying he won’t rent to a single girl,” my broker told me at the time. “It’s seen as… too dangerous.” What the danger was or is remains unclear to me till date. But this is an obstacle every single woman faces in this self-branded “city of dreams,” exacerbated by factors such as age, faith, caste, sexual orientation and gender expression. Due to cultural and social beliefs and economic setbacks, most Indians live at home in “joint families.” It’s common to see a bride leave her parents’ and move in with her husband’s entire family after marriage, for example. Which is why, for the most part, the freedom to roam continues to be restricted to those women who can afford that privilege. Walkar was essentially punished by society for choosing to live life on her own terms, and her choices continue to be dissected by the press. She chose to find a partner of her own on a dating app; she chose to stay in her interfaith partnership despite her parents’ objections; she chose to “live-in” with her partner. The subtext in how this has been covered is clear: serves her right for going against her parents, against the larger values of Indian society. The failed “love marriage” (where a woman has chosen her own partner, instead of an “arranged marriage”) is also a cautionary tale whispered by elderly aunties and grandmothers to the younger women in their lives. Women are constantly expected to defend their choice to be single, unmarried and child-free. When I tell married people I’ve unlearned the idea of settling down with someone as a life milestone, I’m frequently told it’s just a phase I’m going through or that I simply haven’t found the right person yet. But I’m not alone, with an increasing number of women choosing to be single (both in India and globally). Perhaps if Indian society concerned itself more with how its men are reared than why women are choosing to live life differently today, these conversations wouldn’t have to follow the tragic deaths of two young women.",recent week india gripped ghastly murder case two woman yet however breathless medium coverage lost sight bigger picture murder yearold shraddha walkar made front page news across country account gruesome nature according police walkars partner aftab poonawala strangled cut body piece stored fridge scattering across part new delhi poonawala confessed court killing walkar reportedly claiming acted heat moment since case came light indian medium prodded every possible angle including using couple different faith fuel love jihad narrative rightwing conspiracy theory hindu woman lured relationship muslim men stone left unturned clickbait coverage poonawala apparently inspired tv series dexter feature forensic specialist moonlight serial killer couple met bumble popular dating app subsequent piece covered case angle noting murder prompted woman delete dating apps expert blame platform single woman journalist brash unnuanced take incredibly frustrating read onus woman safety solely woman easy name blame everything except obvious issue apps tv series india deeply patriarchal society offer woman little agency backdrop violent murderer like poonawala emerge walkar previously flagged concern safety mumbai police withdrew initial complaint followup police visit action uncommon among victim intimate partner violence aspect case walkar allegedly already victim intimate partner violence overshadowed sensationalist narrative according british medical journal one three indian woman likely subjected intimate partner violence one woman officially report india alone globally according un chief antnio guterres every minute woman girl killed intimate partner family member similar equally gory case made recent headline india aayushi chaudhary yearold indian woman reportedly found murdered body stuffed suitcase police arrested parent reportedly connection suspected honor killing term used describe murder victim brought shame family typically choosing marry outside faith caste india honor killing claimed life according union minister state home affair actual number believed higher story point underlying issue control woman patriarchy take gruesome headline start conversation violence woman ever going address role men play perpetrating violence going discus way violence fluctuates along line class sexual orientation caste india dalit woman group people oppressed century old caste hierarchy reported physically assaulted reported raped ever able address minutia aggression woman face workplace even single woman fair amount privilege im constantly bewildered road bump face living india moved mumbai four year ago shocked difficult find rent flat single landlord saying wont rent single girl broker told time seen dangerous danger remains unclear till date obstacle every single woman face selfbranded city dream exacerbated factor age faith caste sexual orientation gender expression due cultural social belief economic setback indian live home joint family common see bride leave parent move husband entire family marriage example part freedom roam continues restricted woman afford privilege walkar essentially punished society choosing live life term choice continue dissected press chose find partner dating app chose stay interfaith partnership despite parent objection chose livein partner subtext covered clear serf right going parent larger value indian society failed love marriage woman chosen partner instead arranged marriage also cautionary tale whispered elderly aunty grandmother younger woman life woman constantly expected defend choice single unmarried childfree tell married people ive unlearned idea settling someone life milestone im frequently told phase im going simply havent found right person yet im alone increasing number woman choosing single india globally perhaps indian society concerned men reared woman choosing live life differently today conversation wouldnt follow tragic death two young woman,-91.0,negative,2
cnn,Photos: India’s divisive new temple saw half a million visitors on its first day open to the public,"Jan 24, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/india/photos-ayodhya-ram-mandir-temple-inauguration-intl-hnk/index.html,"Half a million people entered the new Ram Mandir on Tuesday, a controversial Hindu temple in the holy town of Ayodhya that is built on the ruins of a destroyed 16th century mosque. Huge crowds of devotees queued outside the temple in the early hours of the morning carrying saffron flags and religious offerings on the first day the large complex was open to the public. A day earlier Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a statue of Lord Ram, one of Hinduism’s most revered deities, in the building’s inner sanctum in a ceremony widely seen as a landmark departure from India’s secular foundations post-independence. Every pillar and wall of the temple’s exterior was decorated with flowers and religious Hindu motifs. Heavy security surrounded the complex, with visitors required to go through checks before entering the building. Half a million people thronged the temple on the first day, according to the Uttar Pradesh Information and Public Relations Department. Hundreds of thousands more are expected to visit in the coming days and weeks. “I’ve bathed and been here since early morning,” Deva, a 30-year-old devotee who had travelled from the Himalayan hill town of Shimla told CNN. “I won’t leave without getting a glimpse of Lord Ram.” Savitri, 44, was among those who had managed to get into the temple’s inner sanctum where the new statue of Ram resides. “I was at the gate since 4am,” she said. “It opened at 7am, I went in braving the massive crowds, but thanks to Lord Ram we got a glimpse of his idol inside and I felt as if I had been blessed by him.” “I’m leaving behind all my worries,” she added. Inside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple Monday, Modi presided over the Pran Pratishtha, or consecration ceremony, of an idol of Lord Ram, one of Hinduism’s most revered deities. Depicted as a young boy, the Ram statue of black stone was adorned with gold jewelry, gemstones, diamonds and flowers. “Today our Lord Ram has come. After centuries of waiting, our Ram has arrived. After centuries of unprecedented patience, countless sacrifices, renunciations, and penances, our Lord Ram has arrived,” Modi said in a speech from the newly-constructed temple bedecked with colorful flowers. “Ram is not a dispute, Ram is the solution.” Hindu priests were also invited to the temple’s opening, with hundreds flocking inside with their cameras to catch a glimpse of the Ram idol and the grand interiors. Dressed in saffron robes, a color closely associated with Hinduism, they were among the first people to step inside the vast building shortly after its inauguration by Modi. Indian celebrities also arrived in Ayodhya to witness the consecration ceremony. Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, cricketer Sachin Tendulkar and tycoon Mukesh Ambani were among some 7,000 guests invited to Monday’s festivities. Actor Anupam Kher, who has appeared in hundreds of films including “Bend It Like Beckham,” and Ram Charan, who appeared in the 2022 hit film “RRR,” were also pictured at the event. Other celebrities, including Alia Bhatt, Ranbir Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit Nene and Katrina Kaif, were also in attendance. Outside the temple’s complex, devotees thronged the streets of Ayodhya, praying in the holy river and performing rituals as the ceremony unfolded. Men and women were pictured carrying saffron flags, wearing flowers around their necks and chanting religious slogans. The Ram Mandir is the realization of Modi’s dream to create what he has called a “new India,” which many consider to be the transformation of the country into a distinctly Hindu nation. For Modi’s detractors, the temple’s inauguration is the conclusion of a decades-long campaign to pull India away from the secular roots upon which the country was founded following independence.

cnn,Modi hails a new ‘divine India’ as he inaugurates controversial Hindu temple ahead of nationwide elections,"Jan 22, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/india/modi-inauguration-india-ayodhya-temple-intl-hnk/index.html,"Millions tuned in across India to watch the opening of a vast Hindu temple on Monday, in a ceremony considered to be the crowning moment for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist ambitions months before he seeks to win a rare third term in elections. The inauguration of the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir – a temple devoted to Lord Ram – in northern India’s Ayodhya is more than 30 years in the making and is expected to give a major boost to Modi’s election campaign. The Ram Mandir is the realization of Modi’s dream to create what he has called a “new India,” which many consider to be the transformation of the country into a distinctly Hindu nation. For Modi’s detractors, the temple’s inauguration is the conclusion of a decades-long campaign to pull India away from the secular roots upon which the country was founded following independence. “Today our Lord Ram has come. After centuries of waiting, our Ram has arrived. After centuries of unprecedented patience, countless sacrifices, renunciations, and penances, our Lord Ram has arrived,” Modi said in a speech to a 7,000-strong crowd that included movie stars, top cricket players and tycoons, from the newly-constructed temple bedecked with colorful flowers. “Ram is not a dispute, Ram is the solution,” he added. Monday’s ceremony fulfils a long-standing promise to voters by Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government that propelled them to power in 2014. For years, Modi and his political allies vowed to build a temple on the site of a 16th century mosque that was destroyed by violent Hindu hardliners in a deadly 1992 attack that turbo-charged the country’s Hindu nationalist movement. The mosque’s demolition, spurred on by the BJP and other right-wing groups, catapulted the party into mainstream politics, winning a general election four years later. Modi did not directly mention the Babri Masjid in his speech, nor the country’s Muslims, many of whom feel pain and sadness at the events that have unfolded in Ayodhya. He did speak of moving forward and “the beginning of a new time cycle.” “From today, from this sacred time, we have to lay the foundation for the next 1,000 years. By moving ahead of building the temple, now we all take the oath of building a national, capable, successful, beautiful, and divine India,” Modi said. Inside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple Monday, Modi presided over the Pran Pratishtha, or consecration ceremony, of an idol of Lord Ram, one of Hinduism’s most revered deities. Depicted as a young boy, the statue of black stone was adorned with gold jewelry, gemstones, diamonds and flowers. Outside, military helicopters flew over the temple and city releasing flower petals over the vast building and crowds of dignitaries below. Among the speakers at the event was Mohan Bhagwat, chief of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the right-wing parent organization of the BJP, who said the temple “has become a symbol of a new India that will stand tall.” “It has been said, and we know, that today in Ayodhya, along with Lord Ram, India’s self has returned,” he said. Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state where Ayodhya is located and one of the country’s most polarizing political figures, called the Ram Mandir India’s “national temple” and an “important ritual of cultural reawakening.” Throughout the day, saffron flags flew high and marigold flowers adorned building entrances as tens of thousands of devotees thronged the streets of the ancient town in celebratory processions. “For 500 years Lord Ram was living in a hut,” devotee Acharya Mohanjodaro Bharadwaj told CNN, referring to the moment the Mughal-era mosque was built. “Today Modi made him sit inside a temple, the whole country is celebrating it like it’s Diwali.” Celebrations were held across the country, with politicians encouraging people to take part in festivities in their homes and temples, ensuring it would be a national event. Uttar Pradesh declared Monday a public holiday, with schools and liquor shops closed across the state. Hundreds of members of the Indian diaspora gathered in New York on Sunday to celebrate the inauguration under a massive image of Lord Ram projected on a screen in Times Square. Indian embassies around the world hosted watch parties. While millions of Hindus celebrated the opening of the much-awaited complex, which is seen by them as the birthplace of Ram, for the country’s minority Muslim population, it’s a painful reminder of religious divisions they fear are becoming more pronounced under Modi’s BJP government. The site of the temple was once home to the Babri Masjid, a 16th century mosque, built during the Mughal empire that ruled India from 1526 to 1858. But the location has been disputed for decades. Many Hindus believe the mosque was built on the ruins of a Hindu temple, allegedly destroyed by Babar, the first Mughal emperor of South Asia. In 1992, spurred on by the BJP and other right-wing groups, Hindu hardliners attacked the mosque, triggering widespread communal violence that killed more than 2,000 people nationwide. The violence was some of the worst seen in India since the bloody clashes that accompanied partition following independence in 1947. In the following years, Hindu nationalists rallied to build the Ram Mandir on the site of the destroyed mosque, setting the stage for an emotional and politically charged showdown that lasted decades. India’s Supreme Court in 2019 granted Hindus permission to build the temple on the contested site, effectively ending the dispute. It was seen as a victory for Modi and his supporters but was a blow to many Muslims for whom the destruction of the Babri Masjid remains a source of deep tension and historic loss. Ayodhya is home to some 3 million people, including about 500,000 Muslims – and some of them are fearful of attacks on the day of the temple’s inauguration. Many have shared messages of support to one another on social media, with WhatsApp messages urging the community to refrain from traveling on public trains and buses for their own safety. Maulana Badshah Khan, 65, recently told CNN he will be staying home on Monday. “The wounds of Babri Mosque’s demolition will always be there. Even if we feel despondent about voicing them,” Khan said. “The temple holds the symbolic value of showing the Muslims their place in New India.” Others have accused Modi of “weaponizing” the Hindu faith and using the Ram Temple for political gain. “Objections include the fact that Modi is not a religious leader and so not qualified to lead the ceremony, and that a Hindu temple cannot be consecrated before it is completed,” said a statement from Hindus for Human Rights, a US-based non-profit advocacy group. Modi “rushing through and fronting it himself is the latest attempt to weaponize Hinduism in the name of the BJP’s repressive nationalist ideology, ahead of national elections in May,” the statement added. Modi rose to power in 2014 with a pledge to reform the country’s economy and usher in a new era of development – but he also heavily pushed a Hindutva agenda, an ideology that believes India should become a land for Hindus. His promise to build the Ram Mandir helped spur that initial election success. Monday’s temple opening is widely expected to boost Modi’s chances of winning a rare third term in a general election expected later this year, having made true on his promise to millions of voters. In the run up to the inauguration, Modi fasted and prayed in an 11-day ritual steeped in Hindu religious symbolism. As part of the rituals, Modi visited shrines and temples linked to Lord Ram across the country. “The Lord has made me an instrument to represent all the people of India during the consecration,” he said in a recorded message on his YouTube channel. On Sunday, Modi posted a video of himself to social media site X walking into the sea and submerging himself under the water at the Arulmigu Ramanathaswamy Temple in southern Tamil Nadu state. Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, author of “The Demolition and the Verdict,” a book about the 1992 mosque demolition, said Modi’s decision to preside over Monday’s festivities is a sign of “Hindu hegemony” in India. “Lines between politics and religions have got blurred,” he said of Modi’s involvement in the ceremony in a country that is constitutionally secular. “They have also got completely blurred between religion and the Indian state. You have at the moment the Indian prime minister who is actually participating in a purely religious activity, with full participation of the government machinery.” The temple doesn’t open to the public until Tuesday but it is expected to draw vast crowds once that happens, and thousands of devotees were already in town on Monday. Among those who made the journey was 90-year-old Urmila Chandravanshi, who traveled more than 700 kilometers (435 miles) from the central state of Chhattisgarh. Clapping and chanting “victory to Lord Ram,” she said she was thrilled to be in Ayodhya and credited Modi for the opening of the temple. “I have come here to seek blessings from Lord Ram and Sita, I am very happy today,” she said. Another devotee, Lal Singh Khushwa, told CNN he walked 70 kilometers to visit the temple. “I have come here to seek blessing from Lord Ram, Modi has done so much,” he said. “I feel very good being here.”",million tuned across india watch opening vast hindu temple monday ceremony considered crowning moment prime minister narendra modis hindu nationalist ambition month seek win rare third term

cnn,Sony’s $10 billion India media deal ends in ugly breakup,"Jan 22, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/media/sony-zee-merger-termination-india-intl-hnk/index.html,"A dramatic acquisition saga in one of the world’s fastest growing media industries is headed for a bitter ending. Sony Group (SONY) has called off the merger between its India unit and Mumbai-based Zee Entertainment, the Japanese company said on Monday. The deal was announced two years ago and would have created a $10 billion media entity in India, with a war chest to take on homegrown rivals as well as global streaming giants such as Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN), according to analysts. Sony’s move to end talks comes at a time when Disney (DIS) and Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries are discussing combining their Indian media businesses. In its statement, Sony said “the closing conditions to the merger were not satisfied,” and added that it “does not anticipate any material impact on its consolidated financial results as a result of the termination of the definitive agreements for the merger.” It did not specify the unmet conditions, but according to media reports there were tensions between the two companies over who would lead the combined entity. Zee had proposed its CEO, Punit Goenka, as the leader of the merged company, but Sony had disagreed as he was being probed by India’s market regulator, Reuters said. In its statement, Zee said it has received the termination letter and “is evaluating all the available options.” The company also said that Sony is seeking a termination fee of $90 million “on account of alleged breaches” by Zee of the merger terms. Zee “categorically denies all the assertions … including their claims for the termination fee,” the statement added. The breakup comes at a time when competition is heating up in India’s entertainment industry. With its relatively free market and vast English speaking population, the world’s most populous country is an attractive destination for global entertainment companies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government expects the nation to soon become the world’s third largest media and entertainment market, from fifth currently. If the Disney-Reliance deal goes through, it would not only help the American company shore up its position in India, but also create a massive entity with over 100 TV channels and two streaming platforms.",dramatic acquisition saga one world fastest growing medium industry headed bitter ending sony group sony called merger india unit mumbaibased zee entertainment japanese company said monday deal announced two year ago would created billion medium entity india war chest take homegrown rival well global streaming giant netflix nflx amazon amzn according analyst sonys move end talk come time disney dis mukesh ambanis reliance industry discussing combining indian medium business statement sony said closing condition merger satisfied added anticipate material impact consolidated financial result result termination definitive agreement merger specify unmet condition according medium report tension two company would lead combined entity zee proposed ceo punit goenka leader merged company sony disagreed probed india market regulator reuters said statement zee said received termination letter evaluating available option company also said sony seeking termination fee million account alleged breach zee merger term zee categorically denies assertion including claim termination fee statement added breakup come time competition heating india entertainment industry relatively free market vast english speaking population world populous country attractive destination global entertainment company prime minister narendra modis government expects nation soon become world third largest medium entertainment market fifth currently disneyreliance deal go would help american company shore position india also create massive entity tv channel two streaming platform,0.0,neutral,0
cnn,Netflix removes Indian movie about Brahmin chef cooking meat after backlash by right-wing Hindu groups,"Jan 16, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/16/india/india-movie-annapoorani-removed-netflix-backlash-intl-hnk/index.html,"Netflix has removed an Indian film from its platform after it sparked backlash and protest from right wing Hindu groups – the latest in several recent controversies where India’s entertainment industry has caved to religious pressure campaigns. The film, ‘Annapoorani: the Goddess of Food’, follows a young woman’s journey to become the best chef in India – which included cooking and eating meat, despite protests from her family, members of Hinduism’s highest and traditionally vegetarian caste, the Brahmins. The movie was released on Netflix on December 29, where it quickly became the streaming platform’s top trending movie in India, according to production studio Zee Entertainment. But less than two weeks later, the film vanished from the site, including its international platforms. “We removed this film at the request of the licensor,” a Netflix spokesperson confirmed to CNN in a statement Tuesday. CNN reached out to Zee Entertainment and the film’s director, but did not receive a response by the time of publication. The film had come under fire from several far-right Hindu groups, with some filing a First Information Report (FIR) – which is required to start an official police investigation – against the film’s director, producer and actors. The FIR was registered with police under the section “outraging religious feelings” and “promoting enmity between different groups,” according to a copy of the document reviewed by CNN. India has various anti-hate speech laws designed to keep relations between different communities civil in a country with a long and bloody history of communal and inter-religious violence. In recent years Hindu nationalist groups have been increasingly adept at using those laws, or the threat of an investigation, to protest and remove content from art and media deemed to be offensive. Ramesh N Solanki, founder and president of the Hindu IT Cell, a group that vows to take legal action against any content “defaming” Hinduism, told CNN he wrote a complaint to police on January 6 alleging the film “is intentionally released to hurt Hindu sentiments.” The main complaint was that the film showed the “daughter of a Brahmin man” eating meat and saying that the revered deity Lord Ram would eat meat, he said. Shriraj Nair, a spokesperson for another group, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), said they had sent letters of complaint to both Netflix and Zee Entertainment on January 9, claiming the movie “hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus and Brahmins of India.” Another VHP spokesperson claimed Zee Entertainment had issued an apology later that day, sharing an image of the letter on X, formerly Twitter. In the letter, the studio said it was coordinating with its co-producers to take action – including removing the film from Netflix “until (it is) edited.” CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the letter and has asked Zee Entertainment for comment. India is a huge part of Netflix’s push into Asia, with the company pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the market in recent years, and adding a Hindi option on its platform in 2020 to reach more Indian users. But, as Netflix and other streaming platforms have found out, navigating India’s media landscape can be fraught, especially with deepening divides in recent years between the country’s religious groups. In 2020, Netflix faced boycott calls in India over a scene in its series “A Suitable Boy,” depicting a young Hindu woman being kissed by a Muslim man at a Hindu temple. The complexity of inter-religious relationships in India is a core part of the seminal novel by Indian writer Vikram Seth that was adapted into the show. But this kiss nonetheless angered many viewers, including members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party. That incident, like the ongoing controversy over ‘Annapoorani,’ prompted a police complaint against Netflix executives. A year later, Amazon’s new Prime Video series “Tandav” came under similar fire, with Indian politicians complaining to police and regulators over its depiction of some Hindu deities. Both Amazon and the show’s creators issued an apology. These controversies have also heightened long-simmering fears among filmmakers and creators over censorship. Indian filmmakers have faced censorship for decades, with reasons ranging from religious objections to accusations that plots are “obscene” or “immoral.” Streaming content broke that mold because it was, until recently, unregulated by the government – but in 2020, authorities announced new rules to rein in streaming services and online content. Those vaguely worded new rules have troubled filmmakers, pointing to a wide range of topics that have already been targeted with complaints and outrage. There are similar fears of censorship and press freedoms among the media, with the government using emergency powers last January to ban the release of a documentary about Modi, and tax authorities searching the BBC’s offices in Delhi and Mumbai the following month.",netflix removed indian film platform sparked backlash protest right wing hindu group latest several recent controversy india entertainment industry caved religious pressure campaign film annapoorani goddess food follows young woman journey become best chef india included cooking eating meat despite protest family member hinduism highest traditionally vegetarian caste brahmin movie released netflix december quickly became streaming platform top trending movie india according production studio zee entertainment le two week later film vanished site including international platform removed film request licensor netflix spokesperson confirmed cnn statement tuesday cnn reached zee entertainment film director receive response time publication film come fire several farright hindu group filing first information report fir required start official police investigation film director producer actor fir registered police section outraging religious feeling promoting enmity different group according copy document reviewed cnn india various antihate speech law designed keep relation different community civil country long bloody history communal interreligious violence recent year hindu nationalist group increasingly adept using law threat investigation protest remove content art medium deemed offensive ramesh n solanki founder president hindu cell group vow take legal action content defaming hinduism told cnn wrote complaint police january alleging film intentionally released hurt hindu sentiment main complaint film showed daughter brahmin man eating meat saying revered deity lord ram would eat meat said shriraj nair spokesperson another group vishwa hindu parishad vhp said sent letter complaint netflix zee entertainment january claiming movie hurt religious sentiment hindu brahmin india another vhp spokesperson claimed zee entertainment issued apology later day sharing image letter x formerly twitter letter studio said coordinating coproducers take action including removing film netflix edited cnn verify authenticity letter asked zee entertainment comment india huge part netflixs push asia company pouring hundred million dollar market recent year adding hindi option platform reach indian user netflix streaming platform found navigating india medium landscape fraught especially deepening divide recent year country religious group netflix faced boycott call india scene series suitable boy depicting young hindu woman kissed muslim man hindu temple complexity interreligious relationship india core part seminal novel indian writer vikram seth adapted show kiss nonetheless angered many viewer including member ruling bharatiya janata party bjp prime minister narendra modis hindu nationalist party incident like ongoing controversy annapoorani prompted police complaint netflix executive year later amazon new prime video series tandav came similar fire indian politician complaining police regulator depiction hindu deity amazon show creator issued apology controversy also heightened longsimmering fear among filmmaker creator censorship indian filmmaker faced censorship decade reason ranging religious objection accusation plot obscene immoral streaming content broke mold recently unregulated government authority announced new rule rein streaming service online content vaguely worded new rule troubled filmmaker pointing wide range topic already targeted complaint outrage similar fear censorship press freedom among medium government using emergency power last january ban release documentary modi tax authority searching bbcs office delhi mumbai following month,-43.0,negative,2
cnn,"Devil’s dung or dinner delight? The story behind hing, one of India’s most divisive ingredients","Jan 16, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hing-indian-food-intl-hnk/index.html,"An appetizer or an abhorrent? A medicine or a pesticide? Asafoetida sounds innocent enough – it’s a wild fennel plant native to Afghanistan, Iran and Uzbekistan. The resin from its roots is used in Indian cooking – usually after it’s ground into powder and mixed with flour. To say it has a powerful smell would be an understatement.  In fact, its scent is so pungent it might just be the most divisive ingredient in the country. ‘Asa’ means gum in Persian, and ‘foetida’ means stinky in Latin. But in India, it’s just called hing. If you accidentally get hing on your hands, it lingers no matter how many times you wash them. Put an unadulterated pinch on your tongue, and your mouth will start burning. At the Khari Baoli market in old Delhi, for instance, hing even manages to ‘out-smell’ all the other spices. “Hing is the mother of all base notes of Indian cooking,” say Siddharth Talwar and Rhea Rosalind Ramji, co-founders of The School of Showbiz Chefs. “It bridged the gap of flavors of onion and garlic that were prohibited due to religious beliefs in the largely vegetarian Indian communities such as Jain, Marwari and Gujarati. Despite the culinary diversity of India, hing is a constant.” Jains, for example, eschew onion, garlic and ginger in addition to not eating meat. Ramji admits that the smell can be a challenge: Raw hing has been compared to rotten cabbage. It’s even been given the nickname “devil’s dung.” But a small amount goes a long way. Talwar advises that you put a miniscule amount of hing into hot oil. Most people buy a powdered version that is mixed in with rice or wheat flour. However, more adventurous cooks will buy the solid crystal form, which looks like rock salt. Some scholars credit Alexander the Great for first bringing hing to India. “The popular theory is that Alexander’s army encountered asafoetida in the Hindu Kush mountains and mistook it for the rare silphium plant, which has similar characteristics to asafoetida,” explains culinary historian Dr. Ashish Chopra. “They painstakingly carried the plant with them to India … only to find out later that it wasn’t what they (expected). Nevertheless, Indians have had their encounter with hing now; it came, it saw, and it stayed.” The professor adds that hing was used in some Greco-Roman cooking but didn’t last long. These days, it’s mostly absent from Western food, with one notable exception: Worcestershire sauce. But as global food patterns and appetites change, some chefs are trying to remake their recipes by skipping onion and garlic in favor of asafetida. According to Talwar, “hing can enhance the umami taste sensation essential for stews and stocks.” “The concept of umami was first introduced by Japanese food experts, but is now the fifth base note in gastronomy after sweet, bitter, sour and salty.” American company Burlap & Barrel even sells a Wild Hing blend made with turmeric, marketed toward people with garlic sensitivity or those following a low FODMAP diet. But the flavor isn’t the only reason you find jars of the proverbial genie on many spice racks of the world. According to the National Library of Medicine, asafoetida has been used as a cough expectorant, an anti-spasmodic and to kill parasites or worms.  Some tout it as an effective Ayurvedic remedy for stomach gas. Furthermore, not everyone has purchased hing for the purpose of eating it. African and Jamaican people sometimes wore amulets of asafoetida, believing it could repel demons. In 1918, in the US, some people wore sachets or bags containing asafoetida to ward off the Spanish flu. These days, its repulsive properties are put to better use as a pesticide in organic farming. Surprisingly, even though India is the world’s highest consumer of asafoetida, it had never been grown in the country until recently. About three years ago, in the cold desert side of the Himalayan region, farmers announced they were trying to cultivate their own hing. The process of growing asafoetida can be slow. But if India manages to cultivate its own, that might mean saving some $100 million per year importing the product itself. And, perhaps more importantly, Indians could have a favorite flavor that is wholly from India.",appetizer abhorrent medicine pesticide asafoetida sound innocent enough wild fennel plant native afghanistan iran uzbekistan resin root used indian cooking usually ground powder mixed flour say powerful smell would understatement fact scent pungent might divisive ingredient country asa mean gum persian foetida mean stinky latin india called hing accidentally get hing hand lingers matter many time wash put unadulterated pinch tongue mouth start burning khari baoli market old delhi instance hing even manages outsmell spice hing mother base note indian cooking say siddharth talwar rhea rosalind ramji cofounder school showbiz chef bridged gap flavor onion garlic prohibited due religious belief largely vegetarian indian community jain marwari gujarati despite culinary diversity india hing constant jains example eschew onion garlic ginger addition eating meat ramji admits smell challenge raw hing compared rotten cabbage even given nickname devil dung small amount go long way talwar advises put miniscule amount hing hot oil people buy powdered version mixed rice wheat flour however adventurous cook buy solid crystal form look like rock salt scholar credit alexander great first bringing hing india popular theory alexander army encountered asafoetida hindu kush mountain mistook rare silphium plant similar characteristic asafoetida explains culinary historian dr ashish chopra painstakingly carried plant india find later wasnt expected nevertheless indian encounter hing came saw stayed professor add hing used grecoroman cooking didnt last long day mostly absent western food one notable exception worcestershire sauce global food pattern appetite change chef trying remake recipe skipping onion garlic favor asafetida according talwar hing enhance umami taste sensation essential stew stock concept umami first introduced japanese food expert fifth base note gastronomy sweet bitter sour salty american company burlap barrel even sell wild hing blend made turmeric marketed toward people garlic sensitivity following low fodmap diet flavor isnt reason find jar proverbial genie many spice rack world according national library medicine asafoetida used cough expectorant antispasmodic kill parasite worm tout effective ayurvedic remedy stomach gas furthermore everyone purchased hing purpose eating african jamaican people sometimes wore amulet asafoetida believing could repel demon u people wore sachet bag containing asafoetida ward spanish flu day repulsive property put better use pesticide organic farming surprisingly even though india world highest consumer asafoetida never grown country recently three year ago cold desert side himalayan region farmer announced trying cultivate hing process growing asafoetida slow india manages cultivate might mean saving million per year importing product perhaps importantly indian could favorite flavor wholly india,5.0,neutral,0
cnn,Why Modi’s beach shots sparked calls for an Indian boycott of Maldives tourism,"Jan 9, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/09/india/maldives-india-modi-tourism-boycott-intl-hnk/index.html,"Maldives is facing a boycott from one of its biggest sources of tourism income after three of its officials mocked India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sparking calls from Indian citizens and celebrities to shun the sun-kissed getaway for domestic beaches instead. The controversy erupted after Modi posted images to social platform X of himself snorkeling and walking along a beach in Lakshadweep, a southern Indian island chain in the Laccadive Sea, off the coast of Kerala. Modi did not mention India’s picturesque neighbor Maldives in his post, but his effusive praise of the beautiful scenery of the lesser-known archipelago may have been seen as a charm offensive to draw people there for vacation rather than Maldives. Three Maldives officials responded to his post, describing Modi as a “clown,” “terrorist” and a “puppet of Israel,” according to Reuters. The Maldives government moved quickly to distance itself from their comments, suspending the three officials - deputy ministers with the Ministry of Youth Employment, Information and Arts - a senior Maldives official told Reuters on Sunday. In a statement, the Maldives government said it was aware of “derogatory” comments made on social media but stressed the “opinions are personal” and do not represent its views. “The government believes that the freedom of expression should be exercised in a democratic and responsible manner, and in ways that do not spread hatred, negativity, and hinder close relationships between the Maldives and its international partners,” it said. The incident comes at a sensitive time, as Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu embarks on a five-day visit to China, his first as President following his election win last October. Muizzu is known for his pro-China stance and pledged to end his predecessor’s “India first” policy in a region where New Delhi and Beijing vie for influence. During the trip, he’s expected to meet Chinese officials and sign “key agreements to improve trade, professional, and socioeconomic development,” according to a government statement. But while Muizzu will be keen to tighten ties with Beijing, the tiny Indian Ocean archipelago – home to around half a million people – can’t afford to alienate its closest neighbor. Maldives relies heavily on tourism and a large slice of that income comes from India – last year the world’s most populous country accounted for the largest group of tourists visiting its tropical beaches, according to Maldives’ tourism website. Indian tourists made more than 209,000 trips to Maldives in 2023, making up 11% of its tourism market, statistics released last week show. Russia contributed about the same amount, and China wasn’t far behind, providing 187,118 visits, or 10% of the total. But the officials’ remarks angered some Indian holidaymakers, who posted screenshots on social media to show they had canceled their trips to the island chain under the hashtag #BoycottMaldives. Prominent figures, from Bollywood actors to cricket players, also urged fans to turn to local destinations instead, with another hashtag #ChaloLakshadweep – meaning “Let’s go to Lakshadweep,” where Modi visited – gaining traction. Among them was Bollywood star Akshay Kumar, known for playing the lead in movies with a patriotic theme. He called the Maldivian officials’ remarks “hateful and racist.” “We are good to our neighbors but why should we tolerate such unprovoked hate? I’ve visited the Maldives many times and always praised it, but dignity first. Let us decide to #ExploreIndianIslands and support our own tourism,” he said. Indian travel site EaseMyTrip said on Monday it had suspended bookings for flights to Maldives. “In solidarity with our nation, @EaseMyTrip has suspended all Maldives flight bookings,” Nishant Pitti, CEO and co-founder of EaseMyTrip said in a post on X. The Confederation of All India Traders, one of the biggest trade bodies in the country, also called on members to suspend business with Maldives. “Until the Maldives tender an apology or ensure remedial measures, the trading community in India will refrain from doing business with them,” said Praveen Khandelwal, Secretary-General of the group, which represents thousands of traders and trade associations in India. In a post on X, Maldives Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer called the officials’ remarks “unacceptable,” adding that the archipelago is committed to “fostering a positive and constructive dialogue with our partners.” A source told CNN on Monday that the Indian High Commission in Maldives had “strongly raised and expressed concerns” to the Maldivian Foreign Office. Michael Kugelman, director of South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, said the Maldives government’s quick action to suspend the officials and denounce their comments showed how much it values Indian relations. “This dispute that’s been playing out in recent days suggests that there will be some challenges ahead, but I would argue that at the end of the day the new leadership in Maldives does not want to risk losing its relationship with India,” he said. “I would contend that this government in Maldives is going to want to balance its relations with both India and China.”",maldives facing boycott one biggest source tourism income three official mocked india prime minister narendra modi sparking call indian citizen celebrity shun sunkissed getaway domestic beach instead controversy erupted modi posted image social platform x snorkeling walking along beach lakshadweep southern indian island chain laccadive sea coast kerala modi mention india picturesque neighbor maldives post effusive praise beautiful scenery lesserknown archipelago may seen charm offensive draw people vacation rather maldives three maldives official responded post describing modi clown terrorist puppet israel according reuters maldives government moved quickly distance comment suspending three official deputy minister ministry youth employment information art senior maldives official told reuters sunday statement maldives government said aware derogatory comment made social medium stressed opinion personal represent view government belief freedom expression exercised democratic responsible manner way spread hatred negativity hinder close relationship maldives international partner said incident come sensitive time maldives president mohamed muizzu embarks fiveday visit china first president following election win last october muizzu known prochina stance pledged end predecessor india first policy region new delhi beijing vie influence trip he expected meet chinese official sign key agreement improve trade professional socioeconomic development according government statement muizzu keen tighten tie beijing tiny indian ocean archipelago home around half million people cant afford alienate closest neighbor maldives relies heavily tourism large slice income come india last year world populous country accounted largest group tourist visiting tropical beach according maldives tourism website indian tourist made trip maldives making tourism market statistic released last week show russia contributed amount china wasnt far behind providing visit total official remark angered indian holidaymaker posted screenshots social medium show canceled trip island chain hashtag boycottmaldives prominent figure bollywood actor cricket player also urged fan turn local destination instead another hashtag chalolakshadweep meaning let go lakshadweep modi visited gaining traction among bollywood star akshay kumar known playing lead movie patriotic theme called maldivian official remark hateful racist good neighbor tolerate unprovoked hate ive visited maldives many time always praised dignity first let u decide exploreindianislands support tourism said indian travel site easemytrip said monday suspended booking flight maldives solidarity nation easemytrip suspended maldives flight booking nishant pitti ceo cofounder easemytrip said post x confederation india trader one biggest trade body country also called member suspend business maldives maldives tender apology ensure remedial measure trading community india refrain business said praveen khandelwal secretarygeneral group represents thousand trader trade association india post x maldives foreign minister moosa zameer called official remark unacceptable adding archipelago committed fostering positive constructive dialogue partner source told cnn monday indian high commission maldives strongly raised expressed concern maldivian foreign office michael kugelman director south asia institute wilson center washington said maldives government quick action suspend official denounce comment showed much value indian relation dispute thats playing recent day suggests challenge ahead would argue end day new leadership maldives want risk losing relationship india said would contend government maldives going want balance relation india china,5.0,neutral,2
cnn,India’s Supreme Court orders 11 men convicted of murder and gang rape to return to jail after early release,"Jan 9, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/08/india/bilkis-bano-supreme-court-india-rape-intl-hnk/index.html,"India’s top court on Monday reversed a state government’s decision to release 11 men convicted of gang-raping a pregnant Muslim woman during Hindu-Muslim riots in 2002, and ordered for them to be sent back to jail. The men were part of a Hindu mob sentenced to life in prison for the gang rape of Bilkis Bano, who was 21 years old and pregnant at the time. The same mob killed 14 members of her family, including her 3-year-old daughter. They were released in August 2022 after serving 14 years of their sentence following a decision made by an advisory panel set up by the Gujarat state government, which is led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). But on Monday, India’s Supreme Court quashed that decision and ordered the men to report back to prison authorities within two weeks. The Gujarat government was “lacking in competency” to pass the remission orders as the trial and sentencing happened in Maharashtra state, the court ruled. The court slammed the Gujarat government for abusing its discretionary powers in releasing the 11 convicts without authority. Bano welcomed the ruling saying she “wept tears relief”. “I have smiled for the first time in over a year and half. I have hugged my children. It feels like a stone the size of a mountain has been lifted from my chest, and I can breathe again,” she said in a statement. When the convicts were released on remission in August 2022, Bano said she felt she had “exhausted her reservoir of courage” but she then found strength in the solidarity that came her way from thousands of people across the country. “You gave me the will to struggle, to rescue the idea of justice not just for me, but for every woman in India. I thank you,” she said. The move was celebrated by supporters of Bano, who had decried the men’s release as an attack not only on Muslims but women’s rights in a country where government data shows a woman is raped every 17 minutes. “Rule of law has been restored by this judgment. Many Congratulations to Bilkis and to all of us who stood by her and fought for her,” said Shobha Gupta, Bano’s lawyer, on Monday after the ruling. Aparna Bhat, an advocate for one of the petitioners of the case, also praised the ruling. “We really salute the judges who interpreted the whole provision of the law and for categorically directing that the accused should surrender,” Bhat said. “This was an extraordinary case and a phenomenal judgment by the Supreme Court.” The crimes committed against Bano took place in February 2002 when centuries-old divisions erupted in Gujarat between the majority Hindus and the minority Muslim community. It was one of India’s worst religious riots, leading to the deaths of more than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims. An inquiry found Modi – then Gujarat’s chief minister – wasn’t to blame for the riots. Bano would later tell the court the men ran toward them with swords, sticks and sickles. According to court documents, one grabbed her young daughter and smashed her on the ground. Three men raped her, while the others attacked her sisters, aunts and their daughters. She fell unconscious and woke hours later, surrounded by bodies. In 2008, after a high-profile trial, her attackers were sentenced to life in prison for rape and murder. But in August 2022, the state government granted them remission under a provision in India’s Code of Criminal Procedure that allows prisoners to be freed once they serve 14 years. The decision sparked outrage across India, with protests held in support of Bano from Kolkata to Mumbai. Critics claimed the decision to release the men was tainted by politics, misogyny and religious discrimination.",india top court monday reversed state government decision release men convicted gangraping pregnant muslim woman hindumuslim riot ordered sent back jail men part hindu mob sentenced life prison gang rape bilkis bano year old pregnant time mob killed member family including yearold daughter released august serving year sentence following decision made advisory panel set gujarat state government led prime minister narendra modis bharatiya janata party bjp monday india supreme court quashed decision ordered men report back prison authority within two week gujarat government lacking competency pas remission order trial sentencing happened maharashtra state court ruled court slammed gujarat government abusing discretionary power releasing convict without authority bano welcomed ruling saying wept tear relief smiled first time year half hugged child feel like stone size mountain lifted chest breathe said statement convict released remission august bano said felt exhausted reservoir courage found strength solidarity came way thousand people across country gave struggle rescue idea justice every woman india thank said move celebrated supporter bano decried men release attack muslim woman right country government data show woman raped every minute rule law restored judgment many congratulation bilkis u stood fought said shobha gupta banos lawyer monday ruling aparna bhat advocate one petitioner case also praised ruling really salute judge interpreted whole provision law categorically directing accused surrender bhat said extraordinary case phenomenal judgment supreme court crime committed bano took place february centuriesold division erupted gujarat majority hindu minority muslim community one india worst religious riot leading death people muslim inquiry found modi gujarat chief minister wasnt blame riot bano would later tell court men ran toward sword stick sickle according court document one grabbed young daughter smashed ground three men raped others attacked sister aunt daughter fell unconscious woke hour later surrounded body highprofile trial attacker sentenced life prison rape murder august state government granted remission provision india code criminal procedure allows prisoner freed serve year decision sparked outrage across india protest held support bano kolkata mumbai critic claimed decision release men tainted politics misogyny religious discrimination,-30.0,negative,0
cnn,Extreme heat is pushing India to the brink of ‘survivability.’ One obvious solution is also a big part of the problem,"Jan 7, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/06/india/extreme-heat-india-climate-ac-intl-hnk/index.html,"When blistering extreme heat gripped India’s capital this summer, Ramesh says he felt faint but had no option other than to keep on toiling under the burning sun to provide for his family. “The heat is becoming unbearable,” the 34-year-old bricklayer told CNN. “But we do not have a choice, we have to work.” Ramesh lives with his parents, three brothers, a sister-in-law, and three children, in a congested suburb in western Delhi, a city that has made headlines in recent years as mercury levels regularly climb to dangerous levels. And as temperatures topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) this June – closing schools, damaging crops and putting pressure on energy supplies – the heat was making his family sick too. Ramesh, who goes by one name, says he borrowed $35 – nearly half of his monthly salary – from relatives to buy a second-hand air conditioner for his home. “It makes a noise, sometimes it releases dust,” he said. But he cannot do without it. By 2050, India will be among the first places where temperatures will cross survivability limits, according to climate experts. And within that time frame, the demand for air conditioners (AC) in the country is also expected to rise nine-fold, outpacing all other appliances, according to a recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Ramesh’s predicament encapsulates the paradox facing the world’s most populous country of 1.4 billion: The hotter and wealthier India gets, the more Indians will use AC. And the more they use AC, the hotter the country will become. India emits nearly 2.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year based on data collected by the European Union – contributing about 7% of global emissions. The United States, by comparison, causes 13% of CO2 emissions, despite having a quarter of India’s population. This raises a question of fairness that climate scientists have often asked: should people in the developing world shoulder the cost of reducing emissions, despite being among those least responsible for rising greenhouse gases? At the COP28 climate talks in Dubai that concluded recently, India wasn’t among the list of countries that signed a pledge to cut their emissions from cooling systems. Addressing the opening session of the summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said all developing countries must be given “a fair share in the global carbon budget.” Nonetheless India, one of the world’s fastest growing economies, is on the front line of the climate crisis. And it finds itself in a tough position. How can it balance its development while ensuring environmental protection? Vast swathes of India’s population remain reliant on AC for their physical and mental wellbeing. And the country’s more tropical southern regions remain hot year-round. Over the past five decades, the country has experienced more than 700 heat wave events claiming more than 17,000 lives, according to a 2021 study of extreme weather in the Weather and Climate Extremes journal. This June alone, temperatures in some parts of the country soared to 47 degrees Celsius (116 Fahrenheit), killing at least 44 people and sickening hundreds with heat-related illnesses. And by 2030, India may account for 34 million of a projected 80 million global job losses from heat stress, according to a World Bank report in December 2022. This puts millions of people at risk in a country where more than 50% of the workforce is employed in agriculture. And as incomes steadily rise, all while urban populations explode, AC ownership has grown at a remarkable rate. Electricity consumption in India from cooling – which includes AC and refrigerators – increased 21% between 2019 and 2022, according to the IEA. By 2050, India’s total electricity demand from residential air conditioners will exceed total electricity consumption in all of Africa today, it added. But this demand is also exacerbating the global climate crisis. Like refrigerators, many air conditioners today use a class of coolants called hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which are harmful greenhouse gases. And even more problematically, air conditioners tend to use large amounts of electricity, generated by the burning of fossil fuels. The World Economic Forum (WEF) estimates that – if not reined in – air conditioning-related greenhouse gas emissions could account for up to a 0.5 degrees Celsius rise in global temperatures by the end of the century. India is still grappling with widespread poverty, while spending billions to upgrade its transport and urban infrastructure, as it faces longstanding challenges to improve living standards. And limiting cooling-related emissions might be seen as a possible barrier to the country’s economic growth, experts say. During the recent COP summit, 63 countries – including the US, Kenya and Canada – signed a pledge to cut their emissions from cooling systems by 68%, along with several other targets, by 2050. India was not among the group. Despite this, Brian Dean, head of energy efficiency and cooling at Sustainable Energy for All, which helped to develop the agreement, said India has shown “important international leadership on cooling.” “While it has not joined the Global Cooling Pledge yet, important progress on sustainable cooling has been made domestically and international partners hope that India considers joining in the future,” he said. Under the United Nations’ 2016 Kigali Amendment, many countries including India are phasing out HFCs and replacing them with more climate friendly options, such as hydrofluoroolefins, or HFOs. Similar moves have worked in the past. The Kigali Amendment is an update to the Montreal Protocol that helped to phase out ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, in the 1980s. Still, countries that lack access to adequate cooling need help to meet the cost of energy improvement, according to Radhika Khosla, associate professor at Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and Environment. “Cooling is now on the global agenda,” she said. “But the hard work must begin to ensure everyone can stay cool without further heating the planet.” Planting trees to absorb sunlight, water bodies, courtyards that promote cooling and clever ventilation are among the more sustainable “passive cooling strategies” suggested by Khosla. Installing ceiling fans in buildings can reduce household energy consumption for cooling by more than 20%, she added. “If successful, passive cooling measures could curb the demand for cooling by 24% by 2050, saving $3 trillion and negating greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 1.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide,” she said. India has also promised to reduce its power demand for cooling purposes by 20-25% by 2038 under its own cooling action plan announced in 2019, while still focusing on developing and implementing cost-effective solutions that align with its economic goals. Dean calls it “one of the first comprehensive national Cooling Action Plans to be developed globally.” It was, he said, “an important moment for emphasizing the need to proactively and urgently address cooling demand growth, including in agriculture where sustainable cold chains can prevent food loss and improve nutritional outcomes.” Renewable energy is also growing faster in India than in any other major economy, and data shows it’s on track to meet its emission reduction targets, according to Leena Nandan, India’s secretary for the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. India remains proactive in finding climate solutions, despite not being a major contributor to the crisis, she told reporters during the COP28 summit. “We have gone on to scale up our climate ambitions,” she said. But India’s AC boom has been visible in almost every urban corner of the country. Hundreds of construction sites are scattered throughout the capital, where laborers toil to build gleaming high-rise towers to house New Delhi’s burgeoning middle class. Penta Anil Kumar, a businessman who lives in Lajpat Nagar, a bustling south Delhi neighborhood, said he is aware of the harmful emissions released from his air conditioner, and deliberately bought an energy efficient model able to meet his cooling needs. “While I know the use of air conditioners is contributing to higher temperatures, I also know I cannot do much else,” he said. But Kumar is among those more fortunate who can afford a more expensive AC model. Ghasiram, a 65-year-old laborer from Delhi’s Rohini neighborhood, paid a contractor $36 to secure a second-hand AC unit for his family. But this is more than what he earns in a month. Ghasiram, who goes by one name, said he didn’t know emissions from his AC were partly fueling rising temperatures. But he is suffering from the consequences. “The heat has gotten worse over the years,” he said. “When I need to step out to work in the heat, I feel nervous. I prefer to not go out.”",blistering extreme heat gripped india capital summer ramesh say felt faint option keep toiling burning sun provide family heat becoming unbearable yearold bricklayer told cnn

cnn,Indian billionaire Gautam Adani says ‘truth has prevailed’ after top court orders regulators to wrap up probe,"Jan 3, 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/03/business/india-adani-hindenburg-court-probe-hnk-intl/index.html,"India’s top court ordered the country’s market regulator on Wednesday to conclude its investigation into the Adani Group quickly and said that no further probes are needed. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had completed 22 of 24 investigations into the Adani Group, the Supreme Court said in a ruling posted to its website. It added that the regulator “cannot keep the investigation open-ended and indeterminate in time.” “Hence, SEBI shall complete the pending investigations preferably within three months,” the judgment said. The ruling, which comes almost one year after the US short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the sprawling Indian conglomerate of “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme,” was welcomed by Gautam Adani, one of Asia’s richest businessmen. The billionaire tycoon reacted to the decision by writing “truth has prevailed,” on X, formerly Twitter. “I am grateful to those who stood by us,” he wrote, adding that “our humble contribution to India’s growth story will continue.” Following the ruling, shares in all 10 Adani Group companies rose in Mumbai, with some trading as much as 10% higher. The scrutiny into Adani—who in September 2022 was worth more than Jeff Bezos and the second-richest person on the planet behind only Elon Musk — started after Hindenburg accused him of pulling off “the largest con in corporate history.” The ports-to-power conglomerate at one point lost over $100 billion in value in the stock market meltdown that followed the scathing January 2023 report by Hindenburg. Short-sellers make money by betting that a company’s stock will fall. In its investigation, which Hindenburg said took two years to compile, the research firm questioned the “sky-high valuations” of Adani firms and said their “substantial debt” puts the entire group “on a precarious financial footing.” The research firm concluded its report with 88 questions for the Adani Group. These ranged from asking for details on Adani’s offshore entities, to why it has “such a convoluted, interlinked corporate structure.” Adani’s personal fortune was hammered by the fallout from the report. He now ranks 15th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. But he has fought back. The Adani Group published a 400-page rebuttal, calling the Hindenburg analysis “nothing but a lie,” charging that Hindenburg’s shorting of overseas-traded bonds and derivatives amounted to securities fraud, and denouncing it as an attack on India. Hindenberg stood by the report. While shares in some of Adani’s businesses, including Adani Ports, have touched record highs recently, others are yet to fully recover the losses they suffered last year. Currently worth nearly $86 billion, Adani is Asia’s second richest man behind fellow countryman Mukesh Ambani, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. He is also seen as a close ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",india top court ordered country market regulator wednesday conclude investigation adani group quickly said probe needed security exchange board india sebi completed investigation adani group supreme court said ruling posted website added regulator keep investigation openended indeterminate time hence sebi shall complete pending investigation preferably within three month judgment said ruling come almost one year u shortseller hindenburg research accused sprawling indian conglomerate brazen stock manipulation accounting fraud scheme welcomed gautam adani one asia richest businessmen billionaire tycoon reacted decision writing truth prevailed x formerly twitter grateful stood u wrote adding humble contribution india growth story continue following ruling share adani group company rose mumbai trading much higher scrutiny adaniwho september worth jeff bezos secondrichest person planet behind elon musk started hindenburg accused pulling largest con corporate history portstopower conglomerate one point lost billion value stock market meltdown followed scathing january report hindenburg shortsellers make money betting company stock fall investigation hindenburg said took two year compile research firm questioned skyhigh valuation adani firm said substantial debt put entire group precarious financial footing research firm concluded report question adani group ranged asking detail adanis offshore entity convoluted interlinked corporate structure adanis personal fortune hammered fallout report rank th bloomberg billionaire index fought back adani group published page rebuttal calling hindenburg analysis nothing lie charging hindenburg shorting overseastraded bond derivative amounted security fraud denouncing attack india hindenberg stood report share adanis business including adani port touched record high recently others yet fully recover loss suffered last year currently worth nearly billion adani asia second richest man behind fellow countryman mukesh ambani according bloomberg billionaire index also seen close ally indian prime minister narendra modi,1.0,neutral,0
cnn,More than a billion people will head to the polls across South Asia in 2024,"Dec 31, 2023",https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/31/asia/india-pakistan-bangladesh-srilanka-elections-2024-intl-hnk/index.html,"An election boycotted by the main opposition as the world’s longest serving female prime minister looks set to extend her rule. A cricket legend and former prime minister languishing in prison versus a one-time fugitive looking to make a comeback as a powerful military keeps watch. A populist leader hoping to enter his second decade in power as he pushes a popular but religiously divisive brand of politics. And an island nation recovering from its worst economic crisis in decades after protesters stormed the presidential palace. Four South Asian countries are expected to head to the polls next year, in a grand test for democracy that will see nearly 2 billion people across Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka cast their ballots from January through September. All former colonies who gained independence from Britain within the last century, each are at a different stage of growth and facing a variety of crises and opportunities. Here’s what you need to know about democracy’s greatest show. Bangladesh, a country of some 170 million people, is the first to cast votes on January 7. The once multiparty democracy is being threatened as its ruling Awami League party continues what rights groups say is a campaign to silence dissent, pushing the republic toward something more closely resembling a one-party state. Sheikh Hasina, current Prime Minister and chair of the Awami Party, is likely to be reelected as the country’s leader for a fourth consecutive term. Hasina has been in power since 2009 and won the last election in December 2019, in a poll marred in deadly violence and accusations of poll rigging. Missing then was her primary opponent Khaleda Zia, a former prime minister and chief of the main opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), who was jailed the year before on corruption charges. For much of the past three decades, politics in Bangladesh has been defined by a bitter rivalry between the two women, who both saw their politician father and husband respectively assassinated in office. Political turmoil has followed into the second generation. Zia, 78, now lives under house arrest and her BNP continues to face mounting challenges by Hasina and her ruling dispensation with the mass arrest of its politicians. The situation has led to protests, and the BNP has decided to boycott the election again, paving the way for Hasina once more. “The government is claiming to commit to free and fair elections with diplomatic partners while the state authorities are simultaneously filling prisons with the ruling Awami League’s political opponents,” said Julia Bleckner, senior Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch, in a November statement. “A free election is impossible when the government stifles free expression and systematically incapacitates the opposition, critics, and activists through arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearance, harassment, and intimidation,” Bleckner added. Yet, the country – which is aspiring to become a middle-income country by 2031 – is experiencing an era of economic growth. Much of this is because of the garment manufacturing industry, which accounts for 35.1% of Bangladesh’s annual gross domestic product, according to the US Commerce Department. “Since it’s come into being, Bangladesh has always had political instability, but they’ve managed to have very good growth rate” said Sreeradha Dutta, professor of international affairs at OP Jindal Global University and author of “Bangladesh on a New Journey – Moving Beyond Regional Identity.” She added also that the country is building strong relations with key neighbors in the region. “So irrespective whoever the leader is, the same developmental models will be picked up… because Bangladesh aspires to be something much larger than what it currently is.” Ruled for much of its 76 years by political dynasties or military establishments, no democratically elected leader has ever completed a full five-year term since Pakistan won independence. In recent years the country of 230 million has seen the all-too-familiar mix of political instability and militant attacks percolate alongside a particularly acute economic crisis that has been brutal on both middle and lower income families. Imran Khan, the country’s former prime minister and arguably the most popular figurehead, is languishing behind bars, charged with fraud and facing charges for revealing state secrets – leaving him unable to contest in the upcoming polls in February. Khan, who was ousted from power in a parliamentary no-confidence vote last year, says the charges against him are politically motivated and framed to stop him from standing in the election, an allegation authorities deny. TV stations are banned from running Khan’s speeches, and many of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party colleagues have been arrested. In October, Nawaz Sharif, the fugitive former prime minister of Pakistan, returned to the South Asian nation after nearly four years in self-exile, skirting arrest and stirring up the country’s already fraught political scene and leaving many to believe he is bidding for the top seat once again. The country, meanwhile, faces mounting challenges – from economic uncertainty and frequent militant attacks to climate catastrophes that are putting millions at risk – setting the stage for a difficult road to recovery for its new leadership. “Political and economic uncertainty go hand in hand,” said Fahd Humayun, assistant professor of political science & Neubauer faculty fellow at the department of political science at Tufts University. “And any government coming to power through suspicious elections is not only likely to be on a weak footing and reliant on the military for its political survival but will also be unlikely to attract the capital inflows so badly needed.” Often called the world’s largest experiment in democracy, India is expected to head to the polls in the spring, in a mammoth election that is likely to see Prime Minister Narendra Modi secure a rare third term in power. The populist leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has tightened his grip on India’s democratic institutions in way not seen since 1970s, when Indira Gandhi ruled the country with an iron fist, pushing it toward autocracy. But on the world stage, India has arguably never been more significant. Modi, whose calendar this year included diplomatic trips to Australia and the United States, is presenting himself as a statesman who is cementing the country as a modern superpower. And 2023 has been a remarkable year for India’s 1.4 billion people. This year was the moment it overtook China to become the world’s most-populous nation, while the year before it surpassed its former colonial ruler Britain to become the world’s fifth-largest economy. In August, India made history by soft landing a rover on the moon, becoming just the fourth nation in the world to have completed such a feat – and it launched its first spacecraft dedicated to studying the sun weeks after. The country hosted the Group of 20 (G20) in September, presenting New Delhi with an opportunity to extend its leadership beyond the country’s borders at a time of increasing political turmoil. Yet, since his first election nearly a decade ago, critics also say the once secular and democratic founding ethos of the world’s largest democracy is crumbling at alarming speed, with minorities feeling persecuted under the BJP’s majoritarian policies and any criticism of the government facing censorship and harsh punishment. Squaring off against Modi is a newly formed alliance of 26 political parties known as INDIA, which includes the country’s main opposition, the Indian National Congress. But in its most recent gauge of voter sentiment, the Congress party lost three out of four regional votes in key state elections in December, giving a boost to Modi and his BJP. As the election draws close, analysts say Indian politics remains unpredictable, and much can change as the parties gear up to campaign in the months ahead. “People are hoping there will be a challenge to Modi, that the opposition parties can get their act together. That dream that seemed possible even three months ago now looks more difficult,” said C. Raja Mohan, senior fellow at Asia Society Policy Institute, during a recent talk with the Asia Society. “But even six months is a long time in politics.” Nearly two years ago, Sri Lanka’s then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to flee his country after angry protesters stormed his residence in anger, blaming him for the country’s worst economic crisis in 73 years. It was a remarkable moment for a protest movement that thrust the bankrupt nation of 22 million into the global spotlight after inflation soared and foreign reserves dwindled, leaving millions unable to afford food, fuel and medicines. Rajapaksa resigned from his post, paving the way for current President Ranil Wickremesinghe to take over. In elections expected before September, Wickremesinghe is likely to stand for a second term, months after he helped secure a much-needed loan from the International Monetary Fund and made sweeping reforms to the budget to ensure financial growth. Sri Lanka hasn’t had a general election since 2018, and Wickremesinghe has repeatedly delayed the polls due to the economic crisis. As the economy – and the country’s people – recover, a date for the election is yet to be announced and it remains to be seen whether 2024 will be the year the country’s people decide on its future

cnn,"December 26, 2023 Israel-Hamas war","Dec 27, 2023",https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-12-26-23/index.html,"Our live coverage of Israel’s war against Hamas has moved here. An hours-long meeting between senior Biden administration officials and a close confidant of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding the next phase of the Israel-Hamas conflict wrapped on Tuesday evening. Ron Dermer, a member of Israel’s war cabinet and a former ambassador to the United States, departed the White House after more than four hours following a meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. A White House official told CNN the discussions included: US officials have looked for Israel to move away from the high intensity war it has waged for nearly three months in Gaza that has resulted in more than 20,000 people killed. The White House told reporters last week that Israel had assured the US it would transition to operations of lower intensity, although the administration would not put a specific timeline on the move. Some context: A senior Israeli official told CNN on Tuesday that while there are differences between the US and Israel over Israel’s war with Hamas, both countries want to see the end of the militant group. “We can have different discussions on this tactical issue or that tactical issue. We listen very attentively to whatever Washington says, and I believe they listen very carefully to whatever we say to them,” said Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Netanyahu. “But ultimately, we’re on the same side of this. We want to see Hamas destroyed.” The United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons said Israel is “working to expel” the civilian population of Gaza. “Israel is seeking to permanently alter the composition of Gaza’s population with ever-expanding evacuation orders and widespread and systematic attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructures” in southern Gaza, Paula Gaviria Betancur said Friday, according to a news release from the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR). Betancur said Israel reneged on its promises of safety in southern Gaza through its evacuation orders urging Palestinians to evacuate from northern to southern part of the enclave, according to the release. People now have been forcibly displaced again along with the population of southern Gaza, Betancur stated. Since October 7 when the conflict began, 85% percent of Gaza’s population has been internally displaced, the release said. Israeli government spokesperson, Eylon Levy, responded to the UN report on his official X platform, asserting that Israel had designated the Al-Muwasi area as a humanitarian zone prior to the ground offensive, urging Gazan civilians to temporarily evacuate there for their safety. He criticized the UN’s failure to condemn Hamas for launching rockets at Israeli communities from within the humanitarian zone, emphasizing the imperative to protect civilians from Hamas. Levy added that those promoting the mass displacement of Gazans were individuals falsely labeling them as “refugees” and supporting violent struggle over peaceful coexistence with Israel. According to the OHCHR, the special rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons is an independent human rights expert appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council. Israel’s defense minister Yoav Gallant said the country is in a “multi-arena war,” with it being attacked from multiple different sectors. He warned of a long fight ahead, while also saying that anyone who acts against Israel is “a potential target.” Gallant’s comments in the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in the Israeli parliament follow Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks Monday that the war is far from over, after the Israeli leader visited Gaza for the second time since October 7. Meanwhile on the diplomatic front, a close confidant of Netanyahu is meeting with US Secretary of State Tony Blinken and US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan Tuesday as the White House has looked for Israel to move away from the high intensity war it has waged in Gaza. A senior Israeli official told CNN that while there are differences between the US and Israel over the war, both countries want to see the end of Hamas. Here are other key developments you should know: The terminally ill mother of a kidnapped Israeli woman wrote a letter to US President Joe Biden on Sunday pleading for his help to secure the release of her daughter. In the letter, Liora Argamani said that, before she dies of brain cancer, she wants to see her daughter, Noa Argamani — who was abducted at the Nova music festival on October 7. “I am terminally ill with Stage 4 brain cancer. All that’s running through my mind before I part ways with my family forever is the chance to hug my daughter, my only child, one last time,” Argamani wrote. Argamani said that she was “devastated” by her daughter’s situation. Argamani wrote that Biden has been “instrumental” in bringing some of Israeli hostages home to their families. “It’s Christmas now, and I would like to request from you, Mr. President, as a present, to see my daughter again before I leave this world,” Argamani said, noting that she is aware “how important family is” for Biden personally, and what an “incredible bond” he has with his children. “My daughter Noa is a contagiously happy and resilient young woman. She loves to dance, loves music, loves being with her friends and family. She deserves to be back where she belongs, pursuing her dreams, surrounded by love and care. She deserves to see her mother alive one last time,” Argamani said. The Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, engaged in discussions with US President Joe Biden in a phone call Tuesday to assess the ongoing developments in Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories, Qatari state news agency QNA reported. According to the statement, the leaders emphasized the significance of joint mediation efforts “to calm the situation and reach a permanent ceasefire.” The White House noted in a readout of the call that the leaders spoke about efforts to “secure the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas.” “The two leaders discussed the urgent effort to secure the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas, including American citizens. The leaders also discussed the ongoing efforts to facilitate increased and sustained flows of life-saving access to humanitarian aid into Gaza,” the readout said. This post has been updated with the White House readout on the call. Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad rejected a plan proposed by Egypt to end the war in the Gaza Strip, Reuters reported on Monday, citing two Egyptian security sources. Two officials from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad denied the information the Egyptian sources provided, Reuters reported. Egypt’s proposal would see the release of all Israeli hostages and Palestinians prisoners and, ultimately, the relinquishment of Hamas’ power and “the establishment of a technocratic government in Gaza,” CNN political and foreign policy analyst Barak Ravid reported. CNN has not independently obtained a copy of the plan. Reuters reported that Egyptian sources said that Hamas and Islamic Jihad “rejected offering any concessions beyond the possible release of more hostages seized on Oct. 7.” Izzat Al-Rishq, member of Hamas political bureau, said in a statement that Hamas did not have information about the Reuters report. “Hamas leadership seeks a permanent cessation to the aggression and massacres against our people. Our people want to see this aggression completely halted, and do not want to wait for a temporary or partial truce for a short period, after which the aggression and terrorism might fatally continue,” Al-Rishq’s statement continued. CNN has reached out to Egyptian officials for comment on the reported plan. Netherlands Deputy Prime Minister Sigrid Kaag will resign from her post to become the United Nations’ new special humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, Kaag said in a statement on X. UN Secretary-General António Guterres announced earlier on Tuesday Kaag’s appointment as senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, according to a statement. The appointment comes after the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2720 last Friday on the ongoing crisis in Gaza, with 13 voting in favor and the US and Russia abstaining following days of marathon talks. The resolution among other things calls for immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale directly to Palestinians throughout the Gaza Strip. The resolution also created Kaag’s new role, calling for the appointment of a senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator responsible for “facilitating, coordinating, monitoring, and verifying” humanitarian relief in Gaza. It also calls for the creation of a UN mechanism to accelerate the movement of aid, which so far has been far from sufficient for the enclave’s population of over two million. Kaag will be responsible for establishing this mechanism with the support of the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS), according to the UN statement. Kaag is due to begin her assignment on January 8, 2024. More on the official: Kaag has held multiple high-level governmental and international roles. She served as Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and was also the first female Minister of Finance in the Dutch government among other roles, the UN statement says. Communications and internet services in the Gaza Strip are fully down, three Palestinian internet providers announced on Tuesday in statements posted on their social media accounts. Internet monitoring site Netblocks told CNN on Wednesday that the network data indicated a new collapse in connectivity in the Gaza Strip. “Our telemetry confirms a new disruption in connectivity in the Gaza Strip — today’s incident is consistent with previous internet and telecoms blackouts and, as in past incidents, is likely to leave most residents offline. Even when there’s some connectivity, service remains significantly below pre-conflict levels,” Netblocks told CNN in a written statement. The Israel Defense Forces is using its ground, air, and naval troops to strike at what it says are “terror targets” in the Gaza Strip, according to a statement from the military on Tuesday. “As part of assistance to the ground troops, dozens of IDF fighter jets struck over 100 Hamas terror targets, including tunnel shafts, infrastructure, and military sites used by the terrorist organization to attack IDF troops,” it said Tuesday. The statement comes as Ron Dermer, considered one of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s closest confidants, is meeting with officials from the White House and the State Department Tuesday to discuss the next phase of the war in Gaza. The US has looked for Israel to move away from the high-intensity war it has waged for nearly three months in Gaza. More than 20,900 people in Gaza have been killed and 55,000 injured since October 7, according to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza. CNN cannot independently verify the numbers released by the ministry in Gaza, as access to the enclave is limited and reliable numbers are hard to confirm amid the fighting. A senior Israeli official told CNN that while there are differences between the US and Israel over Israel’s war with Hamas, both countries want to see the end of the the militant group. Ron Dermer, considered one of Netanyahu’s closest confidants, is expected to meet with officials from the White House and the State Department Tuesday to discuss the next phase of the war in Gaza, CNN has reported. The meetings come as the US has looked for Israel to move away from the high-intensity war it has waged for nearly three months in Gaza. Regev said “it’s only a matter of time” before Israel has victory in northern Gaza, arguing that reconstruction in the enclave can’t happen until Hamas is eliminated. Israel’s defense minister has said the country is in a “multi-arena war,” with Israel being attacked from seven arenas. Yoav Gallant, while speaking to the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in the Israeli parliament, warned of a long fight ahead of the country. “We are in a multi-arena war, we are being attacked from seven different sectors: Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Judea and Samaria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran,” said Gallant, using the biblical names — Judea and Samaria — for the West Bank. “We have already responded and acted in six of these decrees, and I say here in the most explicit way: Anyone who acts against us is a potential target, there is no immunity for anyone,” he added. Gallant’s comments follow Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks Monday that the war is far from over, after the Israeli leader visited Gaza for the second time since October 7. The Indian navy has deployed three guided missile destroyers in the Arabian Sea as a deterrent after a chemical tanker was struck off the Indian coast on Saturday, India’s NDTV reported. The navy inspected the vessel, MV Chem Pluto, which docked in Mumbai on Monday, and analysis of the assault pointed to a drone attack, NDTV cited an Indian navy spokesperson as saying. The navy has also deployed long-range patrol aircraft for surveillance. The United States has blamed Iran for the attack. The Liberia-flagged, Japanese-owned, and Netherlands-operated tanker was struck by a one-way attack drone fired from Iran, a US Department of Defense official told CNN. Iran denied the accusation, with foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani saying at a briefing on Monday that the claim was “baseless,” according to Reuters. On Tuesday, two explosions in the Red Sea were reported by a vessel sailing off the coast of Yemen shortly after two unmanned aircraft were sighted, Reuters reported, citing the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, a British maritime authority. The explosions occurred around 5 miles from the vessel in an area of the Red Sea 50 miles from the port of Hodeidah on Yemen’s west coast, it said, adding that the vessel was in contact with coalition forces and that the ship and crew had been reported safe. Officials from the World Health Organization visited Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza on Monday, where scores of people are being treated, including many from reported airstrikes on the Al-Maghazi refugee camp. In response to a CNN inquiry Sunday, the IDF said it had received reports of an incident in the Al-Maghazi camp and was “reviewing the incident.” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X on Monday that staff at Al-Aqsa had reported receiving around 100 casualties. He said the WHO team at the facility had heard “harrowing accounts shared by health workers and victims of the suffering caused by the explosions.” Tedros emphasized that the hospital is above capacity and warned that “many will not survive the wait.” Sean Casey, a WHO emergency medical teams coordinator, described in a video posted by Tedros watching a 9-year-old boy die due to brain damage he suffered after being wounded by shrapnel in a building explosion. Casey said the only way Al-Aqsa hospital workers could help the child was to sedate him “to ease his suffering as he dies,” because the facility didn’t have the capacity to treat complex neurological cases. Casey said the operating theaters at Al-Aqsa were working 24 hours a day, yet people were still waiting hours and even days for treatment. Dozens reported dead: At least 70 were killed in Al-Maghazi, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reported on Monday. At least 250 were killed and 500 injured in the past 24 hours in the central Gaza areas of Bureij, Nuseirat and Al Maghazi, the Hamas-run ministry added. CNN cannot independently verify the numbers released by the ministry in Gaza, as access to the enclave is limited and reliable numbers are hard to confirm amid the fighting. Responding to a CNN inquiry about the deaths, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Monday: “In response to Hamas’ barbaric attacks, the IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities.” Visits across the strip: WHO and its humanitarian partners visited several hospitals across Gaza over the weekend. Among them was the Al-Shifa hospital in the north, which Tedros called Sunday “a microcosm of the nightmare playing out across Gaza, where drastic shortages of medicines, food, power, water and – above all – safety imperil the population.” Israel has focused a huge amount of attention on Gaza’s hospitals since it began its offensive in Gaza in October, claiming Hamas uses medical facilities for military purposes and showing what it says are underground Hamas tunnels below them, claims CNN cannot verify. Al-Shifa, Gaza’s largest hospital, has been heavily damaged during the fighting. Israel alleged that Hamas had built a large-scale command and control center under the facility, a charge the militant group has denied. CNN last month visited an exposed tunnel shaft in the Al-Shifa hospital compound under IDF media escort. The tunnel shaft extended down farther than CNN’s reporter could see, especially in the meager light of headlamps. Israel’s war in Gaza “will be a long fight” and is far from ending, the country’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday, after he returned from a trip to the enclave. It comes a day after Netanyahu reiterated Israel’s commitment to the war effort, saying the military was “intensifying” operations inside the strip. At least 250 people were killed and 500 others injured over the past 24 hours in central Gaza, the strip’s Hamas-controlled health ministry said Monday. More than 20,000 people have been killed since the conflict began in early October. Here’s what you need to know: A close confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to meet with Biden administration officials on Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the plans, after the Israeli leader vowed a “long fight” ahead in the war in Gaza. Ron Dermer, considered one of Netanyahu’s closest allies, is expected to meet with officials from the White House and the State Department to discuss the next phase of the war in Gaza, the source told CNN. Dermer is a member of Israel’s war cabinet who previously served as ambassador to the United States. He is expected to meet with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and members of Congress, according to Axios, which first reported the meetings. The National Security Council told CNN they do not have any meetings to announce “at this time.” The expected meetings come as the White House has looked for Israel to move away from the high intensity war it has waged for nearly three months in Gaza that has resulted in approximately 20,000 people killed, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Healthy in Ramallah, which draws its data from the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza. Last week, the White House told reporters that Israel has assured the United States that it would transition to operations of lower intensity, though the administration would not put a specific timeline on the transition. US officials previously told CNN they expect Israel could shift its tactics to more localized operations by January. Netanyahu vowed Monday that the war in Gaza was still a “long fight and it is not close to ending.” After his second visit to Gaza since the war began on October 7, Netanyahu said in a statement that Israel would “deepen the fighting.” Iran and several of its armed proxies on Monday vowed to retaliate against Israel following the alleged assassination of a senior Islamic Revolution Guards Corps commander in Syria. IRGC commander Seyyed Razi Mousavi was killed Monday in an Israeli airstrike that targeted him a Damascus suburb, Iran’s state-run IRNA reported, citing a statement from IRGC public relations. The IDF declined to comment on the report when asked by CNN. The IRGC vowed to avenge his killing, saying “the Israeli regime would undoubtedly pay the price for this crime.” Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian also warned Israel of repercussions, saying: “Tel Aviv should expect a tough countdown.” Israel has for years targeted what it calls Iran-linked positions in Syria, where the IRGC, an elite wing of the Iranian military, has a significant presence. According to IRNA, Mousavi was serving as a military adviser in Syria. His alleged assassination comes at a time of heightened regional tensions over Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza, which has led to fears of a wider conflict. Iran’s warnings of retaliation were echoed Monday by Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and the Iran-linked al-Nujaba Resistance Movement in Iraq. In a statement Monday, Palestinian Islamic Jihad condemned Mousavi’s killing and said he “had a fundamental and pivotal role in supporting the resistance forces in the region, and supporting the Palestinian people, their resistance and their cause.” Egypt on Sunday proposed a three-phase plan to end the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, according to various media reports, but it is unclear how the warring parties will receive it. Israel’s war cabinet convened Monday, and among other topics, they were expected to discuss ongoing efforts to secure the release of hostages, an Israeli official told CNN. The source would not acknowledge the reported Egyptian proposal. Egypt’s three-phase deal would “secure the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza,” CNN Political and Foreign Policy Analyst Barak Ravid reports, citing two Israeli sources. CNN has not independently obtained a copy of the plan. Last week, Hamas said Palestinian factions would not agree to any talks about prisoner swaps until after Israel ends its military operation in Gaza. The three-phase plan is also outlined by Israeli and other international news outlets, citing various officials and diplomatic sources. CNN has reached out to Egyptian officials for comment on the reported plan. Tamar Michaelis contributed to this report. As deadly fighting between Israel and Hamas continues, so too does a dire humanitarian crisis in the area. At least 1,200 people have been killed in Israel and, according to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza, more than 20,000 people have been killed in Gaza after Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on Israel October 7. Subsequent airstrikes have overwhelmed local hospitals and internally displaced an estimated one million people in Gaza, one of the most densely populated areas on Earth. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is calling for the protection of aid workers, civilians, and critical infrastructure. Calling the situation “horrific,” Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is urging restraint after medical facilities have been destroyed in the fighting.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was interrupted by shouts from family members of hostages as he spoke during a special session of parliament Monday. The families held posters and signs with the photos and names of their loved ones. Netanyahu, who had just returned from a trip to Gaza, said a brigade commander on the ground told the prime minister that troops needed more time on location to complete their operation. At this time, the families began vocalizing their dissent, saying “There is no time.” As Netanyahu resumed his comments, families could be heard chanting loudly: “Now! Now! Now!” Citing previous interactions with families of fallen Israeli soldiers, Netanyahu said he was told: “Our sons did not die in vain. We must not stop the war until we secure the complete victory over those who wish us dead.” At this point, the family members in the gallery of the Knesset reiterated their chants, saying: “Everyone — now! Everyone — now!” Signs the family members held up said, “We trust you to bring them home,” and “80 days, each minute is like hell.” Another sign asked, “What if this were your daughter,” and rotated between “daughter,” “father,” and “brother.” Key context: There are 129 hostages still in Gaza, according to the prime minister’s office. Of those, 22 are known to be dead. Israel’s war in Gaza is far from ending, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday, after he returned from a trip to the besieged enclave. It was his second visit to the strip since October 7. Netanyahu told his fellow party members that he just returned from a trip to Gaza and met with Israeli soldiers there. They told him to continue the military operation. “We don’t stop, we keep fighting and we deepen the fighting in the coming day,” he said in the statement.",live coverage israel war hamas moved

cnn,Top Indian wrestler quits after federation elects ally of controversial former chief,"Dec 22, 2023",https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/22/india/india-sakshi-malik-quits-wrestling-intl-hnk/index.html,"The only Indian woman wrestler ever to win an Olympic medal said she will quit the sport in protest after the country’s wrestling federation announced it would replace its president, who is accused of sexually harassing female athletes, with his close ally. Sakshi Malik told a news conference in New Delhi on Thursday that it had taken a lot of “courage” to fight against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, 66, a controversial and powerful politician from the country’s ruling party and former chief of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI). “We fought with all we had,” she said, shortly after the new president was announced. Holding back tears, Malik, 31, placed her footwear in front of her in a symbolic gesture of hanging up her shoes. “Upcoming female wrestlers will also face exploitation,” she said. “If (Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh’s) business partner and a close aide is elected as the new president, I quit wrestling.” Malik, who won bronze in the women’s freestyle 58 kilograms at the 2016 Rio Olympics, was among several leading wrestlers who in January supported demands for an inquiry after allegations came to light against Singh of sexual harassment of younger athletes. Delhi police in June charged Singh with assault, stalking, and sexual harassment. He has not been arrested and has denied all allegations. Speaking to CNN on Friday, Singh’s lawyer Rajiv Mohan, said: “We are denying these charges as a whole. It is not possible that these alleged offenses took place over the years, in the presence of brothers, husbands and friends, and no one would say anything. Why would a lady keep silent for so long – that is, for three to four years?” Earlier this year, Malik and several other top wrestlers led a weekslong protest against Singh’s alleged abuse, spending days camping on the streets of Delhi. On Thursday, a panel of voters at the WFI appointed Sanjay Singh, a close aide but no relation to Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, as its new chief, reigniting the controversy that has plagued the sporting body for much of this year. Sanjay Singh was up against Anita Sheoran, a female wrestler who won gold at the Commonwealth Games in 2010. She was a vocal critic of Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and spoke of her desire to create reforms in the wrestling federation. Sanjay Singh said his victory was a “triumph” for the wrestlers “who suffered in the past seven to eight months.” “Wrestlers who want to compete should wrestle. Those who want to do politics, should do politics,” he said, according to local media reports. The wrestlers’ protest had become a flashpoint of criticism against the ruling establishment, with rights activists and opposition politicians accusing authorities of blocking the course of justice. Among those leading the protests alongside Malik was fellow female Olympian Vinesh Phogat, whose rise to prominence in the male-dominated sport has brought joy and pride to millions. CNN has contacted the Wrestling Federation of India and Sanjay Singh for comment.",indian woman wrestler ever win olympic medal said quit sport protest country wrestling federation announced would replace president accused sexually harassing female athlete close ally sakshi malik told news conference new delhi thursday taken lot courage fight brij bhushan sharan singh controversial powerful politician country ruling party former chief wrestling federation india wfi fought said shortly new president announced holding back tear malik placed footwear front symbolic gesture hanging shoe upcoming female wrestler also face exploitation said brij bhushan sharan singhs business partner close aide elected new president quit wrestling malik bronze woman freestyle kilogram rio olympics among several leading wrestler january supported demand inquiry allegation came light singh sexual harassment younger athlete delhi police june charged singh assault stalking sexual harassment arrested denied allegation speaking cnn friday singhs lawyer rajiv mohan said denying charge whole possible alleged offense took place year presence brother husband friend one would say anything would lady keep silent long three four year earlier year malik several top wrestler led weekslong protest singhs alleged abuse spending day camping street delhi thursday panel voter wfi appointed sanjay singh close aide relation brij bhushan sharan singh new chief reigniting controversy plagued sporting body much year sanjay singh anita sheoran female wrestler gold commonwealth game vocal critic brij bhushan sharan singh spoke desire create reform wrestling federation sanjay singh said victory triumph wrestler suffered past seven eight month wrestler want compete wrestle want politics politics said according local medium report wrestler protest become flashpoint criticism ruling establishment right activist opposition politician accusing authority blocking course justice among leading protest alongside malik fellow female olympian vinesh phogat whose rise prominence maledominated sport brought joy pride million cnn contacted wrestling federation india sanjay singh comment,-17.0,negative,2
