nytimes,Man Accused in Plot to Assassinate Sikh Separatist Pleads Not Guilty,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/nyregion/nikhil-gupta-india-assassination-plot.html,"An Indian man pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of orchestrating a failed assassination plot against a Sikh separatist in New York, a plan that prosecutors say he devised on behalf of an unnamed official in India’s government. The defendant, Nikhil Gupta, 52, was arrested in the Czech Republic a year ago, and was extradited last week to make his first appearance in Manhattan federal court. He is accused of trying to arrange the murder of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American citizen and lawyer for a New York-based Sikh secessionist group. The murder attempt, which played out against a backdrop of doubt about India’s commitment to democracy, spanned several countries and mirrored the successful killing of another separatist in Canada, prosecutors say. On Monday morning, Mr. Gupta entered the Lower Manhattan courtroom in a blue cardigan and yellow patterned shirt and appeared relaxed as he spoke to his lawyer, Jeffrey Chabrowe, at the defense table. He has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since landing in the United States on Friday afternoon. In a statement to reporters after the arraignment, Mr. Chabrowe called the case a “complex matter"" for India and the United States. “Background and details will develop that may cast government allegations into an entirely new light,” he said. Mr. Gupta is charged with murder for hire and conspiracy to commit murder for hire. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison for each charge. He was sent back to the detention center after Monday’s arraignment and is set to appear in court again on June 28. In a statement Monday, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said Mr. Gupta will “now face justice” in an American courtroom. “This extradition makes clear that the Justice Department will not tolerate attempts to silence or harm American citizens,” he said. In an indictment unsealed in November, Manhattan federal prosecutors described an audacious plot that began around May 2023 when an Indian government employee enlisted Mr. Gupta to organize the killing of Mr. Pannun, who was living in New York at the time. Mr. Pannun is the general counsel of Sikhs for Justice, an organization that supports the secession of Punjab, a state in northern India. He is a vocal critic of the Indian government and has been banned from the country, prosecutors say. Mr. Gupta, who lived in India, had told the government official about “his involvement in international narcotics and weapons trafficking,” according to the indictment. At the direction of the Indian government employee, Mr. Gupta contacted a man who he believed would help him hire a hit man in New York, but who was, in fact, an agent for the American government. That agent introduced Mr. Gupta to an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration officer who pretended to be the hit man. In deals brokered by Mr. Gupta, the Indian government official agreed to pay the D.E.A. officer $100,000 to kill Mr. Pannun, including a $15,000 cash advance for the job, prosecutors said. Mr. Gupta then shared personal information about Mr. Pannun with the undercover officer, including Mr. Pannun’s address in New York and his phone number. When the Indian official asked for updates, Mr. Gupta relayed surveillance photos of Mr. Pannun that the agent had sent him. Mr. Gupta instructed the undercover officer to carry out the assassination as soon as possible, but asked him not to do it around the time of high-level meetings between U.S. and Indian officials, according to the indictment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington and met with President Biden in June 2023. Then, prosecutors said, on June 18 of that year, gunmen killed Hardeep Singh Nijjar, another Sikh separatist leader, in British Columbia, Canada. Mr. Nijjar knew Mr. Pannun and was also an outspoken critic of the Indian government. Soon after, prosecutors said, Mr. Gupta told the undercover officer that Mr. Nijjar “was also the target” and that “we have so many targets.” Mr. Gupta then told the officer — the pretend hit man — that there was “now no need to wait” to kill Mr. Pannun, prosecutors said. On Monday, Mr. Pannun said in a statement that he had “full faith” that the United States would hold Mr. Gupta and his co-conspirators accountable. “The attempt on my life on American soil is the blatant case of India’s transnational terrorism challenging America’s sovereignty and unequivocally proves that Modi’s India believes in using violence to suppress the dissenting political opinion,” he said. A spokesman for the Indian Embassy in Washington, D.C., could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. Mr. Gupta’s case has threatened to complicate the delicate relations among Washington, Ottawa and New Delhi. During his presidency, Mr. Biden has courted India’s leaders to counter the influence of Russia and China, despite growing concerns about India’s commitment to democracy. Mr. Modi, who has been in office since 2014, was re-elected as India’s prime minister in June, even as his Bharatiya Janata Party lost its majority in Parliament.",indian man pleaded guilty monday charge orchestrating failed assassination plot sikh separatist new york plan prosecutor say devised behalf unnamed official india government defendant nikhil gupta arrested czech republic year ago extradited last week make first appearance manhattan federal court accused trying arrange murder gurpatwant singh pannun american citizen lawyer new yorkbased sikh secessionist group murder attempt played backdrop doubt india commitment democracy spanned several country mirrored successful killing another separatist canada prosecutor say monday morning mr gupta entered lower manhattan courtroom blue cardigan yellow patterned shirt appeared relaxed spoke lawyer jeffrey chabrowe defense table held metropolitan detention center brooklyn since landing united state friday afternoon statement reporter arraignment mr chabrowe called case complex matter india united state background detail develop may cast government allegation entirely new light said mr gupta charged murder hire conspiracy commit murder hire convicted would face maximum year prison charge sent back detention center monday arraignment set appear court june statement monday attorney general merrick b garland said mr gupta face justice american courtroom extradition make clear justice department tolerate attempt silence harm american citizen said indictment unsealed november manhattan federal prosecutor described audacious plot began around may indian government employee enlisted mr gupta organize killing mr pannun living new york time mr pannun general counsel sikh justice organization support secession punjab state northern india vocal critic indian government banned country prosecutor say mr gupta lived india told government official involvement international narcotic weapon trafficking according indictment direction indian government employee mr gupta contacted man believed would help hire hit man new york fact agent american government agent introduced mr gupta undercover drug enforcement administration officer pretended hit man deal brokered mr gupta indian government official agreed pay dea officer kill mr pannun including cash advance job prosecutor said mr gupta shared personal information mr pannun undercover officer including mr pannuns address new york phone number indian official asked update mr gupta relayed surveillance photo mr pannun agent sent mr gupta instructed undercover officer carry assassination soon possible asked around time highlevel meeting u indian official according indictment prime minister narendra modi visited washington met president biden june prosecutor said june year gunman killed hardeep singh nijjar another sikh separatist leader british columbia canada mr nijjar knew mr pannun also outspoken critic indian government soon prosecutor said mr gupta told undercover officer mr nijjar also target many target mr gupta told officer pretend hit man need wait kill mr pannun prosecutor said monday mr pannun said statement full faith united state would hold mr gupta coconspirator accountable attempt life american soil blatant case india transnational terrorism challenging america sovereignty unequivocally prof modis india belief using violence suppress dissenting political opinion said spokesman indian embassy washington dc could immediately reached comment monday mr guptas case threatened complicate delicate relation among washington ottawa new delhi presidency mr biden courted india leader counter influence russia china despite growing concern india commitment democracy mr modi office since reelected india prime minister june even bharatiya janata party lost majority parliament
nytimes,Fire in Kuwait Worker Housing Leaves at Least 49 Dead,"June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/world/middleeast/fire-kuwait-migrant-worker-housing.html,"At least 49 people were killed and dozens of others injured in the Persian Gulf country of Kuwait, the state news agency said, when a fire broke out on Wednesday in a building that housed scores of low-income workers, many of them Indian nationals. The fire began during the morning in a coastal area called Mangaf, about half an hour’s drive from the center of the capital, Kuwait City. The Kuwaiti authorities have held the building owner for questioning as they investigate the cause of the fire and try to determine whether “any shortcoming or neglect” played a role, the state news agency reported. The authorities promised to begin a campaign to tackle building code violations. The public prosecutor’s office also planned to inspect the site and interview survivors. Speaking to journalists at the site of the fire, Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Al Sabah — Kuwait’s deputy prime minister and interior minister — blamed “the greed of property owners” for the disaster and said that the owner of the company employing the workers would also be detained, the Reuters news agency and Kuwaiti newspapers reported. Jayashankar, an Indian salesman who survived the fire, said that he awoke to screams around 4 a.m. local time. He and his roommates opened the door to their fourth-floor apartment and found that thick black smoke had enveloped the corridor, burning their lungs, he said in a phone interview, asking to be identified by his first name only for fear of retribution. Instead of trying to escape, he said, they locked the door, opened a window and waited for help. Two of his roommates who left the apartment to find an exit later died, he said. Witnesses told local news outlets that the fire had begun at the bottom of the seven-story building, sending smoke billowing upward. In a televised interview, an official in Kuwait’s firefighting force, Col. Sayed Hassan Al-Moussawi, said, “In a building like this, you’re supposed to go up to the roof, but unfortunately the door to the roof was locked.” Ramesh, an Indian worker who lives in a building next door and who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said in an interview that he saw people trying to jump out of windows to escape. The fire’s high death toll highlighted the perils faced by low-income immigrants to Gulf countries, who often toil under exploitative contracts and live in overcrowded housing, with regulatory protections that are limited or poorly enforced. Foreigners make up about two-thirds of the population of Kuwait, an oil-rich nation with one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds. Many are low-paid workers from South Asian countries who perform jobs including construction, restaurant service and street cleaning. More than 50 people hurt during the fire were sent to hospitals around Kuwait, with injuries including burns, broken bones from jumping out of the building and carbon monoxide poisoning from smoke inhalation, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. Nine were in critical condition, it said. Many of the workers affected were from India, the country’s embassy in Kuwait said on social media. On Wednesday, India’s ambassador to Kuwait, Adarsh Swaika, visited several hospitals where workers were taken, the embassy said in its posts. In a post on X, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India said that the fire was “saddening” and that the Indian Embassy would monitor the situation closely and work with the authorities “to assist the affected.” In a video published by the Kuwaiti news media, Sheikh Fahad was shown at the location of the fire, questioning an unidentified man about who lived in the building. The man told him that 196 people had lived there. The video cut off after Sheikh Fahad told the authorities to detain the man for questioning. Officials working in the municipality overseeing the area were also suspended from work pending an investigation, Kuwait’s state news agency reported. Building codes in Gulf countries are often laxly put in place, and smoke detectors and fire escapes are not common in residential properties. At the site of the fire on Wednesday afternoon, municipal employees were already putting up notices of violations on nearby buildings, including for partitioning rooms with gypsum board. Mangaf is predominantly inhabited by migrant workers, with apartment blocks housing men from India, Bangladesh and Egypt. Interviewed by The New York Times near the fire location, workers who lived nearby gave varying accounts of the numbers of men typically housed in each room, ranging from three to 12. Jayashankar, the survivor, said that nine people, all Indians, had shared his three-bedroom apartment. The building bore a sign saying it was a workers’ camp for a company called NBTC Group, a contracting firm headquartered in Kuwait with business in construction, industry, logistics and related fields. Phone calls to the company on Wednesday went unanswered, and an employee at the company’s offices said that staff members had been detained by officials that day. Another Indian worker who lived on the second floor of the building said that he and his roommates had survived because they had been out working an overnight shift. The worker, Sami, 45, who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said he had not yet been able to go inside to retrieve his belongings and inspect the damage because the police had closed off entrances to the building. Shahrukh Kha, who is from Bihar, India, said that he had spent all day trying to reach his brother, Kalu, who lived in the building, but that his brother’s phone was off. “We have not gotten any kind of information about whether he is injured or dead,” he said in a phone interview. Kalu Kha, a 30-year-old salesman who works in a fruit and vegetable shop, had been planning to travel home to India next month, his brother said; his wedding date is set for July 22.",least people killed dozen others injured persian gulf country kuwait state news agency said fire broke wednesday building housed score lowincome worker many indian national fire began morning coastal area called mangaf half hour drive center capital kuwait city kuwaiti authority held building owner questioning investigate cause fire try determine whether shortcoming neglect played role state news agency reported authority promised begin campaign tackle building code violation public prosecutor office also planned inspect site interview survivor speaking journalist site fire sheikh fahad yusuf al sabah kuwait deputy prime minister interior minister blamed greed property owner disaster said owner company employing worker would also detained reuters news agency kuwaiti newspaper reported jayashankar indian salesman survived fire said awoke scream around local time roommate opened door fourthfloor apartment found thick black smoke enveloped corridor burning lung said phone interview asking identified first name fear retribution instead trying escape said locked door opened window waited help two roommate left apartment find exit later died said witness told local news outlet fire begun bottom sevenstory building sending smoke billowing upward televised interview official kuwait firefighting force col sayed hassan almoussawi said building like youre supposed go roof unfortunately door roof locked ramesh indian worker life building next door also asked identified first name fear retribution said interview saw people trying jump window escape fire high death toll highlighted peril faced lowincome immigrant gulf country often toil exploitative contract live overcrowded housing regulatory protection limited poorly enforced foreigner make twothirds population kuwait oilrich nation one world largest sovereign wealth fund many lowpaid worker south asian country perform job including construction restaurant service street cleaning people hurt fire sent hospital around kuwait injury including burn broken bone jumping building carbon monoxide poisoning smoke inhalation ministry health said statement nine critical condition said many worker affected india country embassy kuwait said social medium wednesday india ambassador kuwait adarsh swaika visited several hospital worker taken embassy said post post x prime minister narendra modi india said fire saddening indian embassy would monitor situation closely work authority assist affected video published kuwaiti news medium sheikh fahad shown location fire questioning unidentified man lived building man told people lived video cut sheikh fahad told authority detain man questioning official working municipality overseeing area also suspended work pending investigation kuwait state news agency reported building code gulf country often laxly put place smoke detector fire escape common residential property site fire wednesday afternoon municipal employee already putting notice violation nearby building including partitioning room gypsum board mangaf predominantly inhabited migrant worker apartment block housing men india bangladesh egypt interviewed new york time near fire location worker lived nearby gave varying account number men typically housed room ranging three jayashankar survivor said nine people indian shared threebedroom apartment building bore sign saying worker camp company called nbtc group contracting firm headquartered kuwait business construction industry logistics related field phone call company wednesday went unanswered employee company office said staff member detained official day another indian worker lived second floor building said roommate survived working overnight shift worker sami also asked identified first name fear retribution said yet able go inside retrieve belonging inspect damage police closed entrance building shahrukh kha bihar india said spent day trying reach brother kalu lived building brother phone gotten kind information whether injured dead said phone interview kalu kha yearold salesman work fruit vegetable shop planning travel home india next month brother said wedding date set july

nytimes,Train Crash in India Leaves at Least 8 Dead and Dozens Injured,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/world/asia/india-train-crash.html,"A freight train collided with a passenger train in eastern India on Monday, killing at least eight people and injuring 50 others, officials said. The episode occurred at around 9 a.m. when the Kanchanjunga Express, which was carrying passengers to the state of West Bengal from the state of Tripura, was leaving the Rangapani station. Four coaches of the popular and often-crowded passenger train derailed when it was rammed from behind by the commercial train. Images from the accident site showed one of the passenger coaches lifted off the railway track and balancing on a coach of the freight train. The death toll was likely to rise. Local news outlets, citing police officials, reported at least 15 people dead. The driver and the assistant driver of the freight train and a guard on the passenger train were among those killed. Jaya Varma Sinha, the chairperson of India’s railway board, said rescue operations were completed. Ashwini Vaishnaw, India’s railway minister, was en route to the site. The relatively low number of casualties could be attributed to the fact that the rear portion of the Kanchanjunga Express, which took the biggest impact from the collision, comprised cargo coaches and the guard’s coach. Passengers were in compartments far forward from the impact. While an investigation has been ordered to look into the cause of the collision, Ms. Sinha said human error such as disregarding a railway signal could have caused the crash. The accident again brings to the fore the issue of rail safety in a country whose millions of poor residents rely on railways for transport. India’s rail network is one of the world’s largest and is crucial to the country’s economy and its people’s lives and livelihood. The country has, in recent years, invested heavily on rail safety after a long history of deadly accidents. Although the overall number of rail accidents has lessened over the past decade, incidents with mass casualties have persisted. Last June, 290 people were killed when two passenger trains collided after one of them struck a stationary freight train at full speed and derailed in the state of Odisha. After that incident, opposition leaders demanded the resignation of Mr. Vaishnaw, the railway minister. He has said he was trying to expand a safety system, called Kavach, that is meant to prevent accidents when two trains are moving on the same track. Ms. Sinha said the technology had not yet been deployed on the route of the Kanchanjunga Express.",freight train collided passenger train eastern india monday killing least eight people injuring others official said episode occurred around kanchanjunga express carrying passenger state west bengal state tripura leaving rangapani station four coach popular oftencrowded passenger train derailed rammed behind commercial train image accident site showed one passenger coach lifted railway track balancing coach freight train death toll likely rise local news outlet citing police official reported least people dead driver assistant driver freight train guard passenger train among killed jaya varma sinha chairperson india railway board said rescue operation completed ashwini vaishnaw india railway minister en route site relatively low number casualty could attributed fact rear portion kanchanjunga express took biggest impact collision comprised cargo coach guard coach passenger compartment far forward impact investigation ordered look cause collision m sinha said human error disregarding railway signal could caused crash accident brings fore issue rail safety country whose million poor resident rely railway transport india rail network one world largest crucial country economy people life livelihood country recent year invested heavily rail safety long history deadly accident although overall number rail accident lessened past decade incident mass casualty persisted last june people killed two passenger train collided one struck stationary freight train full speed derailed state odisha incident opposition leader demanded resignation mr vaishnaw railway minister said trying expand safety system called kavach meant prevent accident two train moving track m sinha said technology yet deployed route kanchanjunga express
nytimes,"G7 Leaders, Expanding the Circle, Shift Focus to Migration and the South","June 14, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/world/europe/g7-summit-ai-china-india.html,"The Group of 7 countries threw open the doors of their club on Friday to India, Brazil, Turkey and other non-Western countries, acknowledging a shifting global landscape as they tried to enlist these nations’ leaders in causes ranging from climate change to managing the economic competition with China. While diplomats from the Group of 7 hammered out a communiqué that pledged support for Ukraine in its war against Russia and greater ambition in curbing carbon emissions, the focus was on Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and other leaders from outside the G7, whose support is increasingly critical to achieving any of these goals. Among the thorny questions on the second day of the summit: migration, which has helped fuel a recent resurgence of populism and far-right parties in Europe and the United States. The leaders also discussed the war in Gaza and China’s state subsidies of industries like electric vehicles, which has prompted the United States and the European Union to impose tariffs on Chinese exports. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, who is hosting the gathering, said the goal of her expanded guest list was to “strengthen dialogue with the nations of the Global South.” She insisted that the Group of 7 was “not a fortress closed in itself” but “an offer of values that we open to the world.” Ms. Meloni recruited Pope Francis to speak to the leaders about the dangers posed by artificial intelligence. Francis urged them to regulate the technology, of which he was himself a victim when A.I.-generated fake images of him clad in a white puffer jacket and a jewel-encrusted crucifix went viral last year. “The benefits and the damages it causes will depend on the way it is used,” the pope declared, warning of the risks of A.I.’s uncontrolled development. He called for lethal autonomous weapons, which are unmanned and uncontrolled by a human hand, to be banned, saying, “No machine should ever decide whether to take the life of a human being away.” The pope’s appearance was the emotional highlight of a day of carefully staged summitry that seemed to concede that the West is less dominant demographically and economically than in the past — and that it is listening to calls for more equity and balance in global decision-making. As Ms. Meloni guided the pope, in a wheelchair, around a circular table to meet the leaders, he was greeted by a visibly moved President Biden and got an enthusiastic hug from Argentina’s flamboyant president, Javier Milei, whose election last November was viewed as another sign of the rising tide of populism across the Americas and Europe. This is not the first time non-Western leaders have been invited to a Group of 7 meeting, but rarely have they been so conspicuous. In part that reflects the issues that Ms. Meloni has highlighted: Africa and the Mediterranean. The leaders of Algeria, Kenya and Tunisia were on hand at a luxury resort hotel on Italy’s southern coast, as was President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. “Inviting key developing country leaders reflects the reality that confronting China and Russia requires the cooperation of more than the G7,” said Daniel M. Price, who was a top trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “And Brazil, India and Turkey are as concerned about Chinese predatory trade practices and overcapacity as are Japan, Europe and the U.S.” The final G7 communiqué voiced concern about what the leaders called China’s “persistent industrial targeting and comprehensive nonmarket policies and practices that are leading to global spillovers, market distortions and harmful overcapacity.” The communiqué endorsed Mr. Biden’s effort to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. France and Canada had pushed for stronger language on Israel’s conduct of the war, according to people familiar with the negotiations, but the United States and Germany resisted. In a victory for Ms. Meloni, a conservative who opposes abortion, the communiqué did not include an explicit reference to abortion, in a passage that pledged to promote “comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.” A communiqué released by the Group of 7 leaders after their last summit in Hiroshima, Japan, referred specifically to abortion rights. The issue injected a briefly discordant note into the gathering after President Emmanuel Macron of France told an Italian journalist that some politicians did not share France’s “vision of equality between women and men.” Ms. Meloni criticized Mr. Macron, who recently called a snap parliamentary election, as seeking to politicize the issue at a “precious forum like the G7.” For the most part, however, the meeting underscored harmony among the leaders, many of whom are embattled by their own domestic politics. It also served as a platform for Ms. Meloni, 47, who has overcome initial qualms about her political roots in a party built on the ashes of fascism to win respect for her steadfast support of Ukraine. Presiding over the two days of meetings, she was able to put a spotlight on several of her pet issues. How to control migration has vexed the United States and Europe, compounded by the effects of climate change and warfare in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Ukraine. It is a particularly delicate issue for Ms. Meloni, who has campaigned hard to fight what she has called “uncontrolled immigration” to Italy and other parts of Europe from Africa and the Middle East. While Europe has welcomed thousands of Ukrainians, especially women and children, fleeing the Russian invasion, Ukrainian officials have urged European countries to help them repatriate men of fighting age. “Turkey is a critical player on global migration,” said Peter Westmacott, who served as Britain’s ambassador to Turkey, France and the United States. He noted that there are about three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds and Afghans. “If Europe wants to control migration from these countries,” Mr. Westmacott said, “Turkey is an indispensable partner.” Mr. Erdogan, he said, could also yet play a role in brokering an end to Ukraine’s war with Russia. As a Black Sea power, Turkey has kept open its commercial and political links to Russia. But it is also a NATO member and has supplied cheap, highly effective drones to help the Ukrainian resistance. Some of the invitations reflected diplomatic protocol, according to Italian officials.

nytimes,Fire in Kuwait Worker Housing Leaves at Least 49 Dead,"June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/world/middleeast/fire-kuwait-migrant-worker-housing.html,"At least 49 people were killed and dozens of others injured in the Persian Gulf country of Kuwait, the state news agency said, when a fire broke out on Wednesday in a building that housed scores of low-income workers, many of them Indian nationals. The fire began during the morning in a coastal area called Mangaf, about half an hour’s drive from the center of the capital, Kuwait City. The Kuwaiti authorities have held the building owner for questioning as they investigate the cause of the fire and try to determine whether “any shortcoming or neglect” played a role, the state news agency reported. The authorities promised to begin a campaign to tackle building code violations. The public prosecutor’s office also planned to inspect the site and interview survivors. Speaking to journalists at the site of the fire, Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Al Sabah — Kuwait’s deputy prime minister and interior minister — blamed “the greed of property owners” for the disaster and said that the owner of the company employing the workers would also be detained, the Reuters news agency and Kuwaiti newspapers reported. Jayashankar, an Indian salesman who survived the fire, said that he awoke to screams around 4 a.m. local time. He and his roommates opened the door to their fourth-floor apartment and found that thick black smoke had enveloped the corridor, burning their lungs, he said in a phone interview, asking to be identified by his first name only for fear of retribution. Instead of trying to escape, he said, they locked the door, opened a window and waited for help. Two of his roommates who left the apartment to find an exit later died, he said. Witnesses told local news outlets that the fire had begun at the bottom of the seven-story building, sending smoke billowing upward. In a televised interview, an official in Kuwait’s firefighting force, Col. Sayed Hassan Al-Moussawi, said, “In a building like this, you’re supposed to go up to the roof, but unfortunately the door to the roof was locked.” Ramesh, an Indian worker who lives in a building next door and who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said in an interview that he saw people trying to jump out of windows to escape. The fire’s high death toll highlighted the perils faced by low-income immigrants to Gulf countries, who often toil under exploitative contracts and live in overcrowded housing, with regulatory protections that are limited or poorly enforced. Foreigners make up about two-thirds of the population of Kuwait, an oil-rich nation with one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds. Many are low-paid workers from South Asian countries who perform jobs including construction, restaurant service and street cleaning. More than 50 people hurt during the fire were sent to hospitals around Kuwait, with injuries including burns, broken bones from jumping out of the building and carbon monoxide poisoning from smoke inhalation, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. Nine were in critical condition, it said. Many of the workers affected were from India, the country’s embassy in Kuwait said on social media. On Wednesday, India’s ambassador to Kuwait, Adarsh Swaika, visited several hospitals where workers were taken, the embassy said in its posts. In a post on X, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India said that the fire was “saddening” and that the Indian Embassy would monitor the situation closely and work with the authorities “to assist the affected.” In a video published by the Kuwaiti news media, Sheikh Fahad was shown at the location of the fire, questioning an unidentified man about who lived in the building. The man told him that 196 people had lived there. The video cut off after Sheikh Fahad told the authorities to detain the man for questioning. Officials working in the municipality overseeing the area were also suspended from work pending an investigation, Kuwait’s state news agency reported. Building codes in Gulf countries are often laxly put in place, and smoke detectors and fire escapes are not common in residential properties. At the site of the fire on Wednesday afternoon, municipal employees were already putting up notices of violations on nearby buildings, including for partitioning rooms with gypsum board. Mangaf is predominantly inhabited by migrant workers, with apartment blocks housing men from India, Bangladesh and Egypt. Interviewed by The New York Times near the fire location, workers who lived nearby gave varying accounts of the numbers of men typically housed in each room, ranging from three to 12. Jayashankar, the survivor, said that nine people, all Indians, had shared his three-bedroom apartment. The building bore a sign saying it was a workers’ camp for a company called NBTC Group, a contracting firm headquartered in Kuwait with business in construction, industry, logistics and related fields. Phone calls to the company on Wednesday went unanswered, and an employee at the company’s offices said that staff members had been detained by officials that day. Another Indian worker who lived on the second floor of the building said that he and his roommates had survived because they had been out working an overnight shift. The worker, Sami, 45, who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said he had not yet been able to go inside to retrieve his belongings and inspect the damage because the police had closed off entrances to the building. Shahrukh Kha, who is from Bihar, India, said that he had spent all day trying to reach his brother, Kalu, who lived in the building, but that his brother’s phone was off. “We have not gotten any kind of information about whether he is injured or dead,” he said in a phone interview. Kalu Kha, a 30-year-old salesman who works in a fruit and vegetable shop, had been planning to travel home to India next month, his brother said; his wedding date is set for July 22.",least people killed dozen others injured persian gulf country kuwait state news agency said fire broke wednesday building housed score lowincome worker many indian national fire began morning coastal area called mangaf half hour drive center capital kuwait city kuwaiti authority held building owner questioning investigate cause fire try determine whether shortcoming neglect played role state news agency reported authority promised begin campaign tackle building code violation public prosecutor office also planned inspect site interview survivor speaking journalist site fire sheikh fahad yusuf al sabah kuwait deputy prime minister interior minister blamed greed property owner disaster said owner company employing worker would also detained reuters news agency kuwaiti newspaper reported jayashankar indian salesman survived fire said awoke scream around local time roommate opened door fourthfloor apartment found thick black smoke enveloped corridor burning lung said phone interview asking identified first name fear retribution instead trying escape said locked door opened window waited help two roommate left apartment find exit later died said witness told local news outlet fire begun bottom sevenstory building sending smoke billowing upward televised interview official kuwait firefighting force col sayed hassan almoussawi said building like youre supposed go roof unfortunately door roof locked ramesh indian worker life building next door also asked identified first name fear retribution said interview saw people trying jump window escape fire high death toll highlighted peril faced lowincome immigrant gulf country often toil exploitative contract live overcrowded housing regulatory protection limited poorly enforced foreigner make twothirds population kuwait oilrich nation one world largest sovereign wealth fund many lowpaid worker south asian country perform job including construction restaurant service street cleaning people hurt fire sent hospital around kuwait injury including burn broken bone jumping building carbon monoxide poisoning smoke inhalation ministry health said statement nine critical condition said many worker affected india country embassy kuwait said social medium wednesday india ambassador kuwait adarsh swaika visited several hospital worker taken embassy said post post x prime minister narendra modi india said fire saddening indian embassy would monitor situation closely work authority assist affected video published kuwaiti news medium sheikh fahad shown location fire questioning unidentified man lived building man told people lived video cut sheikh fahad told authority detain man questioning official working municipality overseeing area also suspended work pending investigation kuwait state news agency reported building code gulf country often laxly put place smoke detector fire escape common residential property site fire wednesday afternoon municipal employee already putting notice violation nearby building including partitioning room gypsum board mangaf predominantly inhabited migrant worker apartment block housing men india bangladesh egypt interviewed new york time near fire location worker lived nearby gave varying account number men typically housed room ranging three jayashankar survivor said nine people indian shared threebedroom apartment building bore sign saying worker camp company called nbtc group contracting firm headquartered kuwait business construction industry logistics related field phone call company wednesday went unanswered employee company office said staff member detained official day another indian worker lived second floor building said roommate survived working overnight shift worker sami also asked identified first name fear retribution said yet able go inside retrieve belonging inspect damage police closed entrance building shahrukh kha bihar india said spent day trying reach brother kalu lived building brother phone gotten kind information whether injured dead said phone interview kalu kha yearold salesman work fruit vegetable shop planning travel home india next month brother said wedding date set july
nytimes,"At the Ambani Wedding Celebrations, a Dazzling Display of Jewels","June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/fashion/weddings/ambani-jewels.html,"When Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India abruptly changed her country’s constitution in 1971 and abolished the Privy Purse, a government allowance for the country’s former princely rulers, she also moved to nationalize their storied treasuries. Among the maharajahs, nizams and nabobs that once ruled the subcontinent, this set off a frenzy as they scurried to bury the family jewels. For centuries, the rarity, scale and grandeur of Indian jewels was so great that many became iconic objects. Take the Patiala Necklace, a tiered ornament resembling draperies of gems. Designed by Cartier, it featured an astounding 2,930 diamonds and centered on a single rock the size of a walnut. Or consider the Indore Pears, two stupendous and closely matched diamonds owned by Maharajah Yeshwant Rao Holkar II, a glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom was in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Indian princely patronage long set a global standard of splendor for both artistry and ostentation in the jewel trade. Yet in the decades after the Privy Purse, most of the big rocks seemed to have vanished underground. Legend has it that members of formerly royal families stashed their jewels in Swiss vaults, pawned them on the black market or hid them in flower pots. Bling on a royal scale largely disappeared. Or so it seemed until a fresh cadre of princes heaved into view: oligarchs. The richest of these by orders of magnitude is Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of his family’s megacompany Reliance Industries. Mr. Ambani’s personal fortune is estimated by Forbes at a staggering $115 billion. Despite his vast wealth, few outside India had heard of him — that is, until March 1, when he hosted a three-day party to celebrate his son Anant’s wedding in July. Everything about the prewedding affair was on a princely scale: the guest list of 1,000, including boldface names like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump; a glass palace specially constructed in the Ambani’s hometown, Jamnagar, in the western state of Gujarat; and Rihanna’s first public performance in years. Rihanna’s reported $6 million payday hogged the headlines, but what lit up at least one obsessive corner of the internet was the Ambani jewelry. This included necklaces and earrings and rings and hair ornaments of a size and grandeur seldom seen publicly since the days of the Raj. “It was almost like the time of maharajahs 100 years down the line,” said Pramod Kumar, an archivist and a founder of the museum consultancy EKA. He is also keeper of topophilia.india, an erudite Instagram account that is catnip for Indophile aesthetes. Mr. Kumar’s sleuth work traced a possible source of the two most gobsmacking gems seen at the Ambani prewedding celebration: massive step-cut Colombian emeralds roughly the size of Popsicles. Draped one below the other as pendants to a diamond necklace, they were worn one evening by the bridegroom’s mother, Nita Ambani. The bigger one was “of 562 carats,” Mr. Kumar wrote in an Instagram post, adding that the weight of the smaller stone was a mere 303 carats. Whatever their source, those emeralds were just two among many gems on display throughout an event at which the jewels often had greater star power than their wearers. “That emerald necklace was what caught everyone’s attention at first, but it was all almost unfathomable,” said Stellene Volandes, the editor in chief of Town & Country. She noted the scarcity represented by ropes of the rarest natural pearls from the Arabian Sea; necklaces in the heavy, ornate rani haar style studded with diamonds; and headpieces known as maang tikka, made with deep green emeralds from the storied Muzo mines. “You’d be very hard-pressed to find comparables for the sheer size and horsepower” of the jewels at the Ambani prewedding party, said Nico Landrigan, the president of the Verdura jewelry house in New York. “The Indians are a jewelry-obsessed culture in a category all their own. So you can only imagine what the actual wedding will bring out.” Before the wedding, scheduled for July 12 to 14 in Mumbai, there was yet another lavish preparatory celebration and opportunity to flaunt big rocks — a cruise from the Tyrrhenian Sea in Palermo, Italy, to the Mediterranean in Cannes, France, on an ocean liner whose 2,400 staterooms had been retrofitted for the Ambanis as three-bedroom suites for 800 invited guests. “Basically, what the Ambanis are doing is displaying a kind of old-style Hollywood glam,” said Mr. Kumar of EKA. “You don’t see that with any other current billionaire moguls in Europe or America, at least not in the public realm.” For Daniela Mascetti, the former chairwoman of Sotheby’s jewelry division in Europe and an author of “Understanding Jewelry,” a bible of the trade, the group more aptly compared to the Ambanis is the robber barons of the Industrial Age. “You have to look back to Vanderbilt or Gould, who also wanted big door-stoppers,” Ms. Mascetti said from London. “Let’s put it in a nice way,” she added. “If you are new money and you want to display wealth, you go big.” Yet it is not altogether that simple. Certain Ambani jewels were crafted using the whopper stones, but that is not to suggest that the determining factor in commissioning them was size. “There is tremendous artistry in the work,” said Ms. Volandes of Town & Country. Much of the Ambani jewels were designed by Viren Bhagat, among the more refined high jewelers, though also an assiduously private one. More than the size of individual stones like the stepped-cut emeralds, few save a detective like Mr. Kumar could predict their origins. “Being one-off is of the greatest importance in that world,” Francesca Amfitheatrof, the creative director of high jewelry and watches at Louis Vuitton, said recently from St.-Tropez, France, where she was debuting her latest collection. “To be able to source things that are so unique and outstanding, honestly, only an emperor has that possibility anymore,” she said. “It’s completely maharajah-like. It’s imperial.”",prime minister indira gandhi india abruptly changed country constitution abolished privy purse government allowance country former princely ruler also moved nationalize storied treasury among maharajah nizams nabob ruled subcontinent set frenzy scurried bury family jewel century rarity scale grandeur indian jewel great many became iconic object take patiala necklace tiered ornament resembling drapery gem designed cartier featured astounding diamond centered single rock size walnut consider indore pear two stupendous closely matched diamond owned maharajah yeshwant rao holkar ii glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom central indian state madhya pradesh indian princely patronage long set global standard splendor artistry ostentation jewel trade yet decade privy purse big rock seemed vanished underground legend member formerly royal family stashed jewel swiss vault pawned black market hid flower pot bling royal scale largely disappeared seemed fresh cadre prince heaved view oligarch richest order magnitude mukesh ambani chairman family megacompany reliance industry mr ambanis personal fortune estimated forbes staggering billion despite vast wealth outside india heard march hosted threeday party celebrate son anants wedding july everything prewedding affair princely scale guest list including boldface name like mark zuckerberg bill gate ivanka trump glass palace specially constructed ambanis hometown jamnagar western state gujarat rihannas first public performance year rihannas reported million payday hogged headline lit least one obsessive corner internet ambani jewelry included necklace earring ring hair ornament size grandeur seldom seen publicly since day raj almost like time maharajah year line said pramod kumar archivist founder museum consultancy eka also keeper topophiliaindia erudite instagram account catnip indophile aesthete mr kumars sleuth work traced possible source two gobsmacking gem seen ambani prewedding celebration massive stepcut colombian emerald roughly size popsicle draped one pendant diamond necklace worn one evening bridegroom mother nita ambani bigger one carat mr kumar wrote instagram post adding weight smaller stone mere carat whatever source emerald two among many gem display throughout event jewel often greater star power wearer emerald necklace caught everyones attention first almost unfathomable said stellene volandes editor chief town country noted scarcity represented rope rarest natural pearl arabian sea necklace heavy ornate rani haar style studded diamond headpiece known maang tikka made deep green emerald storied muzo mine youd hardpressed find comparables sheer size horsepower jewel ambani prewedding party said nico landrigan president verdura jewelry house new york indian jewelryobsessed culture category imagine actual wedding bring wedding scheduled july mumbai yet another lavish preparatory celebration opportunity flaunt big rock cruise tyrrhenian sea palermo italy mediterranean cannes france ocean liner whose stateroom retrofitted ambanis threebedroom suite invited guest basically ambanis displaying kind oldstyle hollywood glam said mr kumar eka dont see current billionaire mogul europe america least public realm daniela mascetti former chairwoman sothebys jewelry division europe author understanding jewelry bible trade group aptly compared ambanis robber baron industrial age look back vanderbilt gould also wanted big doorstopper m mascetti said london let put nice way added new money want display wealth go big yet altogether simple certain ambani jewel crafted using whopper stone suggest determining factor commissioning size tremendous artistry work said m volandes town country much ambani jewel designed viren bhagat among refined high jeweler though also assiduously private one size individual stone like steppedcut emerald save detective like mr kumar could predict origin oneoff greatest importance world francesca amfitheatrof creative director high jewelry watch louis vuitton said recently sttropez france debuting latest collection able source thing unique outstanding honestly emperor possibility anymore said completely maharajahlike imperial

nytimes,"India-Pakistan Cricket World Cup Match Brings 34,000 Fans to Long Island","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/nyregion/india-pakistan-cricket-world-cup.html,"Normally at this time of year, the grassy southeastern corner of Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, N.Y., is a place for softball games, family picnics and a few cricket players enjoying a warm weekend afternoon. On Sunday, that space was transformed into a stage for one of the most-watched global sporting events of the year. More than 34,000 fans and cricket dignitaries squeezed into a temporary stadium built in the last three months in the Long Island park to watch the most anticipated match of the T20 Cricket World Cup: India versus Pakistan. For about three hours, fans in blue and orange India shirts mingled with their (vastly outnumbered) rivals in the dark green of Pakistan, producing a festive and vibrant atmosphere. They roared at every big play, shouting and waving signs and flags. They ate South Asian food sold at the concession stands, jumped, chanted, high-fived with fellow supporters and — after a bit of rain — soaked up the sunshine on a historic day at the usually quiet park. “It was electric,” said Chandu Talla, an India fan and entrepreneur from Tampa, Fla., who came to the match with his son Aryan, a high school junior. “We paid $2,500 per ticket and no regrets,” he added. “It was a dream come true to see India here.” After a slow start, India came back strong to win, and when Pakistan’s Naseem Shah hit the last ball from India bowler Arshdeep Singh, the India fans erupted in cheers. “It was pretty good,” said India bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who was named the player of the match. “Always, when India and Pakistan play, a lot of emotion does come in. It did feel like we had a lot of support.” People in the New York area may have been mostly oblivious to it, but any match between India and Pakistan, two of the greatest cricketing nations, is a monumental event, at least in South Asia and other cricket-loving parts of the world. The previous time the teams played, last fall, viewership reached 398 million in India alone, according to the International Cricket Council. (This year’s Super Bowl had 123 million viewers.) Sunday’s attendance (34,028) constituted the largest at an international cricket match in the United States, according to the I.C.C. Attendees included such cricketing legends as Yuvraj Singh of India, Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi and Australia’s Ricky Ponting. For Omar Minaya, the Yankees’ special adviser and the former general manager of the Mets, the cricket match was his first. “It’s amazing,” he said. “The atmosphere is great. It’s like the World Baseball Classic, or the Dominican Baseball League.” The T20 World Cup, held every two years, is a 20-nation tournament featuring a shorter form of cricket. This year, for the first time, the event is being held in the United States and several Caribbean nations where cricket is revered. The U.S. matches are also being held in Dallas and Lauderhill, Fla., but New York was designated for the marquee matchup. Cricket is part of the cultural fabric in both India and Pakistan, but political tensions over the decades have forced the countries to play each other in other places. “Oh, it’s contentious, a real battle of sentiments,” said Narinder Kapoor, 84, a retired U.S. Treasury Department agent, originally from New Delhi. “When these countries play, it’s a real hot potato.” A former amateur cricket player who emigrated to Syosset, N.Y., in 1972, Mr. Kapoor had not seen a cricket match live since 1974, although he watches the sport constantly on TV. He went to the game between Ireland and Canada on Friday and had hoped to attend Sunday’s big encounter, but his knees were ailing him, so he stayed home, according to his son, Sandeep Kapoor. The elder Mr. Kapoor said that he enjoyed the sparsely attended match on Friday, but added that the temporary stadium did not have enough accommodations for people with disabilities and that it was difficult for older people to ascend the steps. “But once you are inside, the field and the view is excellent,” he said. “World class.” Security was tight for the match, especially after a website purportedly affiliated with the terrorist organization ISIS called for attacks on the event. Mounted police, SWAT units, sniffer dogs, helicopters and large numbers of police officers swarmed the area, and long lines formed at entrances as people went through security scanners. Bruce Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, said that the I.C.C. had defrayed some of the cost of the security, which he said included local, state and federal agencies, including the F.B.I. “I want to commend the fans,” Mr. Blakeman said, adding, “Everybody has been so polite and respectful, and they followed instructions so they could be safe and healthy.” There was at least one exception. An airplane trailing a sign that said “Release Imran Khan” breached restricted airspace over the stadium before the match. (Mr. Khan, a former Pakistani cricket star and former prime minister of Pakistan, is serving a prison sentence there.) Mr. Blakeman said the plane was eventually intercepted. The mood at the park was generally upbeat, even for Pakistan fans on the losing end. “India-Pakistan is a very big deal,” said Temu Martin, an airfreight transport official from New Jersey and a Pakistan supporter. “But it’s not war. It’s a game.” He said that after Pakistan lost to the United States last week in a major upset in Dallas, ticket prices for Sunday’s match in East Meadow plummeted from over $2,000 to $600. He said he was planning to travel to Barbados for Pakistan’s next match and then to attend a knockout-stage match in Antigua. There are three more matches scheduled in New York, with the final one on Wednesday between India and the United States. The stadium will then be dismantled and the pieces sent out to other sporting events around the country. Mr. Blakeman predicted that Nassau County would make $150 million on the eight New York games of the tournament — 10 times what the county spent on infrastructure, planning and security, he said. Cricket officials had told him that there could be as many as 600 million viewers worldwide for Sunday’s match, he added. He said that he had heard from investors who want to bring the sport, perhaps with New York’s franchise in Major League Cricket, to Nassau County. “The way things have gone here these last couple of weeks, I think cricket has found a home,” Mr. Blakeman said.",normally time year grassy southeastern corner eisenhower park east meadow ny place softball game family picnic cricket player enjoying warm weekend afternoon sunday space transformed stage one mostwatched global sporting event year fan cricket dignitary squeezed temporary stadium built last three month long island park watch anticipated match cricket world cup india versus pakistan three hour fan blue orange india shirt mingled vastly outnumbered rival dark green pakistan producing festive vibrant atmosphere roared every big play shouting waving sign flag ate south asian food sold concession stand jumped chanted highfived fellow supporter bit rain soaked sunshine historic day usually quiet park electric said chandu talla india fan entrepreneur tampa fla came match son aryan high school junior paid per ticket regret added dream come true see india slow start india came back strong win pakistan naseem shah hit last ball india bowler arshdeep singh india fan erupted cheer pretty good said india bowler jasprit bumrah named player match always india pakistan play lot emotion come feel like lot support people new york area may mostly oblivious match india pakistan two greatest cricketing nation monumental event least south asia cricketloving part world previous time team played last fall viewership reached million india alone according international cricket council year super bowl million viewer sunday attendance constituted largest international cricket match united state according icc attendee included cricketing legend yuvraj singh india pakistan shahid afridi australia ricky ponting omar minaya yankee special adviser former general manager mets cricket match first amazing said atmosphere great like world baseball classic dominican baseball league world cup held every two year nation tournament featuring shorter form cricket year first time event held united state several caribbean nation cricket revered u match also held dallas lauderhill fla new york designated marquee matchup cricket part cultural fabric india pakistan political tension decade forced country play place oh contentious real battle sentiment said narinder kapoor retired u treasury department agent originally new delhi country play real hot potato former amateur cricket player emigrated syosset ny mr kapoor seen cricket match live since although watch sport constantly tv went game ireland canada friday hoped attend sunday big encounter knee ailing stayed home according son sandeep kapoor elder mr kapoor said enjoyed sparsely attended match friday added temporary stadium enough accommodation people disability difficult older people ascend step inside field view excellent said world class security tight match especially website purportedly affiliated terrorist organization isi called attack event mounted police swat unit sniffer dog helicopter large number police officer swarmed area long line formed entrance people went security scanner bruce blakeman nassau county executive said icc defrayed cost security said included local state federal agency including fbi want commend fan mr blakeman said adding everybody polite respectful followed instruction could safe healthy least one exception airplane trailing sign said release imran khan breached restricted airspace stadium match mr khan former pakistani cricket star former prime minister pakistan serving prison sentence mr blakeman said plane eventually intercepted mood park generally upbeat even pakistan fan losing end indiapakistan big deal said temu martin airfreight transport official new jersey pakistan supporter war game said pakistan lost united state last week major upset dallas ticket price sunday match east meadow plummeted said planning travel barbados pakistan next match attend knockoutstage match antigua three match scheduled new york final one wednesday india united state stadium dismantled piece sent sporting event around country mr blakeman predicted nassau county would make million eight new york game tournament time county spent infrastructure planning security said cricket official told could many million viewer worldwide sunday match added said heard investor want bring sport perhaps new york franchise major league cricket nassau county way thing gone last couple week think cricket found home mr blakeman said
nytimes,"Modi, Striking a Modest Tone, Is Sworn In for a Third Term","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/world/asia/india-changed-modi-swearing-in.html,"As a humbled Narendra Modi was sworn in on Sunday for a third term as India’s prime minister, the political air in New Delhi appeared transformed. The election that ended last week stripped Mr. Modi of his parliamentary majority and forced him to turn to a diverse set of coalition partners to stay in power. Now, these other parties are enjoying something that for years was singularly Mr. Modi’s: relevance and the spotlight. Their leaders have been swarmed by TV crews while on their way to present demands and policy opinions to Mr. Modi. His opponents, too, have been getting more airtime, with stations cutting live to their news conferences, something almost unheard-of in recent years. Above all, the change can be seen in Mr. Modi himself. For now, at least, the messianic air is gone. He pitches himself as the modest administrator that voters showed they wanted. “To run the government, a majority is necessary. But to run the nation, a consensus is necessary,” Mr. Modi said in a speech on Friday to members of his coalition ahead of his swearing in. “The people want us to deliver better than before.” A visibly emotional Mr. Modi took the oath of office on Sunday evening, only the second prime minister to be elected for a third consecutive term in the seven decades of India’s republic. The ceremony, at the country’s presidential palace, was attended by about 8,000 supporters and dignitaries, including the leaders of India’s neighboring nations. To many, Mr. Modi’s shift in approach can mean only good things for the country’s democracy — a move toward moderation in a hugely diverse nation that was being whipped into a Hindu-first monolith in the image of one man. The question is whether Mr. Modi can truly become something he has not been during his two-plus decades in elected office: a consensus builder. “He is a pragmatic politician and, for his own survival and for the survival of his party, he will be a little mellowed,” said Ashutosh, a New Delhi-based analyst who uses only one name and is the author of a book on how Indian politics have changed under Mr. Modi. “But to assume a qualitative change in his style of governance is expecting too much.” A trademark of Mr. Modi’s leadership in recent years has been the use of power levers at his disposal — from pressure of police cases to the lure of a share in power and its perks — to break his opponents and get them to switch to his side. A bruised governing party may well try such tactics to peel away some lawmakers to his side, analyst say, to buttress his place at the top. But in the days leading up to the swearing-in, a change in approach was evident. When members of the new coalition packed into the hall of India’s old Parliament building on Friday for deliberations on forming the government, every time a senior ally seated next to him stood up to start his speech, Mr. Modi also stood up. When it was time for Mr. Modi to be garlanded as the coalition’s choice for prime minister, he waited for the leaders of the two main coalition partners to arrive by his side before the congratulatory wreath of purple orchids was placed around his neck. His hourlong address contained none of his usual references to himself in the third person. His tone was measured. He focused on the coalition’s promise of “good governance” and “the dream of a developed India,” and he acknowledged that things would be different from the past 10 years. The last time Mr. Modi came to the Parliament complex for a closely watched event, last May when he inaugurated a new, more modern building for the assembly, he made an entrance some observers compared with that of a king: with markings on his forehead as a sign of piety and a scepter in his hand, as shirtless, chanting Hindu monks walked ahead of and behind him. This time, he went straight to a copy of the Constitution, which declares that India is a secular and socialist democracy, bowing before it and lifting it to his forehead. For the first time in his more than two decades in elected office, Mr. Modi finds himself in uncharted territory. Until now, as long as he has been at the helm — whether at the state level as the chief minister of Gujarat or at the national level — his Bharatiya Janata Party has always had a majority. Analysts say that history of never having been in the opposition has shaped his heavy-handed approach to politics. When he left Gujarat, after 13 years, he had established such a firm grip and had so routed the opposition that the state had effectively become one of single-party rule. His first national victory in 2014, with a majority for his B.J.P., ended decades of coalition governance in India, in which no party had been able to capture the 272 seats in Parliament necessary for a majority. In 2019, he was re-elected with an even bigger majority. Mr. Modi’s enormous power helped swiftly carry out what had for decades been his right-wing party’s agenda, including construction of a lavish Hindu temple on a long-disputed site that once held a mosque, and the revocation of the special status long enjoyed by the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir. A separatist insurgency has long troubled the Himalayan Kashmir region. As the inauguration ceremony began in New Delhi on Sunday, a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims in the Reasi district fell into a gorge after gunmen opened fire on it. At least eight people were killed, the police said. A trademark of Mr. Modi’s governance was a disregard for parliamentary procedures and for debates on legislation. His unexpected, overnight demonetization in 2016 — which invalidated India’s currency in an effort to crack down on corruption — threw the country into chaos and dealt a blow to a still cash-driven economy. Similarly, rushing to enact laws aimed at overhauling the agriculture market resulted in a year of protests that choked Delhi, forcing Mr. Modi to retreat. Before the election results came out, Mr. Modi’s party had predicted that his coalition would win 400 seats in India’s 543-seat Parliament. The opposition would be reduced to sitting “in the spectators’ gallery,” Mr. Modi said. Officials in his government had made clear that in his new term he would seek to put in place the only main item remaining on his party’s agenda: legislating a “uniform civil code” across this diverse country to replace varying laws of different religions that currently govern issues like marriage and inheritance. His party leaders spoke of Mr. Modi not only as their leader for the current term, but also for the next election in 2029, when he would be 78. “He has been trying to transform the country,” Sudesh Verma, a B.J.P. official who wrote a book on Mr. Modi’s rise, said in an interview before the election results were announced. “I look forward to him working like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, who worked into his 90s.” But under a coalition government, Mr. Modi’s traditional approach will be difficult. Two of the main coalition parties that helped him achieve the minimum number of Parliament seats to form a government are secular, in contrast to Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist ideology. N. Chandrababu Naidu, whose party holds 16 seats, has been scathing in the past in his criticism of Mr. Modi’s treatment of the Muslim minority. He has also openly criticized Mr. Modi for using the central investigating agencies to target his opponents and taking “steps to subvert all democratic institutions.” Neerja Chowdhury, a political analyst in Delhi and the author of the 2023 book “How Prime Ministers Decide,” said, “The contentious ideological issues, like the enactment of the uniform civil code, may be put on the back burner if the allies are not comfortable with it.” Mr. Modi’s popular image is built on two strong pillars. He is a champion of economic development, with an inspiring biography of a rise from a humble caste and relative poverty. He is also a lifelong Hindu nationalist, with decades as a foot soldier in a movement seeking to turn India’s secular and diverse state into an overtly Hindu-first place. At the peak of his power, the Hindu nationalist aspect increasingly dominated. Analysts say that the recent rebuke by voters might be a lucky break for the nation: prompting Mr. Modi to tap into his development champion side, and to focus on a legacy of economic transformation that could improve the lives of all Indians.",humbled narendra modi sworn sunday third term india prime minister political air new delhi appeared transformed election ended last week stripped mr modi

nytimes,"India’s Modi, Humbled by Voters, Faces Potent Economic Struggles","June 7, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/business/india-election-modi-economy.html,"Before the Indian election results emerged this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was widely viewed as a charismatic and popular strongman celebrated by the business world for elevating its importance, even as he failed to solve a vexing problem: how to turn swift economic growth into critically needed jobs. After the election, Mr. Modi finds himself staring at that same monumental puzzle, yet relegated to an uncomfortable new status. He is the head of a party that has been chastened at the polls, forcing him to forge a coalition to maintain power. Mr. Modi’s governing authority is likely to be constrained by the complexities of keeping his coalition partners on his side. He could not solve India’s most deep-seated economic challenge when he wielded a monopolistic hold on power. Now, he is a weakened leader who must balance additional interests, while still lacking an obvious way to improve living standards. “There has been a sense that employment growth has been weak in the last four, five years,” said Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic adviser to the Modi administration, who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “How do you create more jobs? This is really India’s central economic challenge, but I think the government will find itself with relatively limited tools.” The humbling of Mr. Modi’s party resonates in part as an expression of popular frustration that India remains a land of economic peril for hundreds of millions of people, as well as a country defined by astonishing contrasts in wealth. In major cities, five-star hotels boasting sumptuous spas look down on teeming slums that lack plumbing. In rural areas, malnutrition prevails under many roofs, and families struggle to find the money to keep children in school. Though its working-age population numbers roughly one billion, India has only 430 million jobs, according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, an independent research institution in Mumbai. And most of those counted as employed are stuck in precarious circumstances as day laborers and farm hands, lacking reliable wages and government workplace protections. Improved livelihoods are evident in many cities, from the high-rise apartments filling out the horizons to air-conditioned shopping malls and luxury cars choking roads. But the gains are narrowly concentrated. Professionals who work in technology centers in the south of the country and around the capital of New Delhi have enjoyed substantial progress. A rapidly growing domestic auto industry is a source of relatively high-paying jobs. Magnates like Gautam Adani, one of Asia’s richest men, have seen their business empires enhanced by their relationships with Mr. Modi and his willingness to eviscerate regulatory impediments to their greater fortune. But most Indian workers are effectively marooned in the so-called informal sector — laboring at roadside stalls, in small shops and in itinerant trades where they have no guarantee of income or the possibility of advancement. The failure of economic growth to yield more jobs is in large part the story of how India missed out on the manufacturing boom that played out in East Asia over recent decades. From South Korea and China to Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, hundreds of millions of people have escaped poverty via wages earned in factories. India has not shared in that transformation in large part because of a historical focus on self-sufficiency, a disdain for international trade and stultifying bureaucracy that has discouraged investment. “The whole manufacturing thing bypassed India,” Mr. Subramanian, the economist, said. “It’s that bigger development failure that is continuing to haunt India.” Mr. Modi has pursued initiatives aimed at bolstering manufacturing and increasing exports. His administration has streamlined regulations and improved ports. Yet despite some high-profile developments like Apple moving the assembly of some iPhones to India, manufacturing makes up only 13 percent of the country’s economy, according to World Bank data. That is a lower share than a decade ago, when Mr. Modi took office. Foreign money has flowed into India’s stock markets, multiplying share prices, a key element of Mr. Modi’s pro-business image. But persuading international investors to put money directly into Indian companies — a riskier bet — has been a harder sell. His Hindu nationalist party has demonized the Muslim minority, a source of social ferment that has raised fears of instability. The election could further discourage additional investment, because Mr. Modi will likely have a more difficult time gaining passage of stalled reforms sought by business, including laws making it easier to amass land and hire and fire workers. With no clear pathway toward economic dynamism and more challenging political circumstances, Mr. Modi might resort to a time-honored method of shoring up support: He will expand social welfare programs, tapping government coffers to hand out more cash to communities in need. Such a course could potentially diminish available funding for the advancement of the government’s signature program — its aggressive construction of highways, ports, airports and other infrastructure. Those plans are central to maintaining India’s strong economic growth and the broader campaign to encourage investment in manufacturing. Some fear that any short-term pursuit of political favor through the scattering of money could undermine the longer-term project of spurring jobs through the promotion of industry. “You need to ensure that the benefits of economic development reach the maximum number of people,” said Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at Global Data.TS Lombard, a forecasting and consulting firm in London. “If people keep depending on welfare and are not getting the benefits of economic development, then it basically just creates stagnation.” Geopolitical alterations appear to give India a fresh crack at growing its manufacturing base. As the United States and China engage in trade hostilities, multinational brands are seeking to reduce their heavy dependence on Chinese factories to make their goods. Major retailers like Walmart are increasingly looking to India as an alternative to China. But capturing that potential investment demands continued upgrading of highways, rail connections and ports, along with a focus on vocational training to give people the needed skills to take up factory work. Even before the election, there were doubts that Mr. Modi’s administration was moving quickly enough to realize these gains. “India is a counterweight to China in terms of geopolitics, and we will continue to see some of that investment flowing,” Ms. Deveshwar said. “But the scale at which they are provisioning the ecosystem for these opportunities just is not large enough.”",indian election

nytimes,The World Heads to the Polls,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/climate/global-elections-climate-change-policy.html,"One of the busiest election cycles in history is coming to an end on Sunday. Hundreds of millions of people have gone to the polls in South Africa, India and Mexico in recent days, and millions more will do the same in the European Union this weekend. As Somini Sengupta has explained in a series of articles this week, among the issues that the new leaders of these countries will face: how to transition away from coal, how to adapt to record-breaking heat and, in Europe’s case, how to address a growing backlash against environmental policies. Today, I want to lay out some the most pressing environmental challenges in these areas, and what the results announced in the past few days point to. Keep in mind that whatever happens in the United States election in November will affect many of these countries, too. The biggest takeaway from India’s elections, as my colleagues who cover the country put it, is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “lost his aura of invincibility.” His Bharatiya Janata Party still won far more seats than any other party, and Modi is set to take up his third consecutive term as prime minister. But his party didn’t win an outright majority and now needs coalition partners to stay in power. Many critics of the current government see the result as good news for democracy, because Modi will be forced to seek support from more moderate allies. It could also bring some relief to activists like Ritwick Dutta, an environmental lawyer whose efforts to defend nature in India have made him a target of the government. But it’s unclear how fewer seats in Parliament will affect Modi’s environmental policies. The main challenges facing the next Indian government are what to do about the effects of climate change, including heat waves that have killed dozens of people. During the elections, at least 33 poll workers were among them, and the heat also closed schools in several states,",one busiest election cycle history coming end sunday hundred million people gone poll south africa india mexico recent day million european union weekend somini sengupta explained series article week among issue new leader country face transition away coal adapt recordbreaking heat europe case address growing backlash environmental policy today want lay pressing environmental challenge area result announced past day point keep mind whatever happens united state election november affect many country biggest takeaway india election colleague cover country put prime minister narendra modi lost aura invincibility bharatiya janata party still far seat party modi set take third consecutive term prime minister party didnt win outright majority need coalition partner stay power many critic current government see result good news democracy modi forced seek support moderate ally could also bring relief activist like ritwick dutta environmental lawyer whose effort defend nature india made target government unclear fewer seat parliament affect modis environmental policy main challenge facing next indian government effect climate change including heat wave killed dozen people election least poll worker among heat also closed school several state
nytimes,Narendra Modi’s India,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/briefing/modis-india.html,"Narendra Modi has just won re-election as India’s prime minister, though by a far narrower margin than expected. With his third consecutive term, the charismatic strongman has still sealed his position as the country’s most significant leader in generations. Despite having led India for a decade, Modi has in some ways kept his country guessing about his vision. On major issues — India’s relationships, its economy, its society and its government — it’s still unclear what sort of country Modi wants India to be. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain four of the big questions. India has spent recent years deepening its relationship with the United States. It has gotten closer to American allies, including Japan and Australia, and ordered high-end American weapons systems — the kind that create dependence down the road. And it is unlikely to side with China. In 2020, Chinese troops crossed into territory controlled by India and killed 20 soldiers in a skirmish. Modi has kept Beijing at arm’s length since then. But Modi, 73, has signaled that he doesn’t want to be a U.S. ally. Some officials in his inner circle still regard the United States warily. American diplomats complain about New Delhi’s apparent efforts to erode democratic norms and the rights of minority groups. So India keeps its options open. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States tried in vain to persuade India to take a stand against the war. India still processes Russian oil (picking up the slack created by international sanctions). It still buys weapons from Russia. India spent the Cold War trying to position itself as a nonaligned power. Old habits die hard. India recently overtook China as the most populous country and the fastest-growing large economy. Still, most of the country remains poor. Some 800 million people need help filling their stomachs. Modi’s ideas about how to help them can be contradictory — they’re both globally minded and protectionist.",narendra modi reelection india prime minister though far narrower margin expected third consecutive term charismatic strongman still sealed position country significant leader generation despite led india decade modi way kept country guessing vision major issue india relationship economy society government still unclear sort country modi want india today newsletter ill explain four big question india spent recent year deepening relationship united state gotten closer american ally including japan australia ordered highend american weapon system kind create dependence road unlikely side china chinese troop crossed territory controlled india killed soldier skirmish modi kept beijing arm length since modi signaled doesnt want u ally official inner circle still regard united state warily american diplomat complain new delhi apparent effort erode democratic norm right minority group india keep option open russia invaded ukraine united state tried vain persuade india take stand war india still process russian oil picking slack created international sanction still buy weapon russia india spent cold war trying position nonaligned power old habit die hard india recently overtook china populous country fastestgrowing large economy still country remains poor million people need help filling stomach modis idea help contradictory theyre globally minded protectionist
nytimes,"In Global Elections, Strongmen Are Taken Down a Notch","June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/world/global-elections-india-turkey-democracy.html,"In India, a powerful leader wins another term but sees his party’s majority vanish. In South Africa, the governing party is humbled by voters for the first time since the end of apartheid. In Britain, a populist insurgent barges into an election that is shaping up to be a crushing defeat for the long-ruling Conservatives. If there is a common thread halfway through this global year of elections, it is a desire by voters to send a strong signal to the powers that be — if not quite a wholesale housecleaning, then a defiant shake-up of the status quo. Even in Mexico, where Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and the handpicked successor of the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was elected in a landslide last Sunday, voters were rewarding the forces that had uprooted the country’s entrenched establishment only six years earlier. With a billion-plus people going to the polls in more than 60 countries, some analysts had feared that 2024 would pose a fateful test for democracy — one that it might fail. For years, populist and strongmen leaders have chipped away at democratic institutions, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of elections, while social media has swamped voters with disinformation and conspiracy theories. In some of the biggest, most fragile democracies, leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey had been regarded as close to invincible, using appeals to nationalism or sectarianism to mobilize supporters and bending institutions to suit their purposes. Yet now, Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan have both had their wings clipped. Soaring inflation, chronic unemployment and uneven economic growth have widened inequality in India, Turkey and elsewhere, frustrating voters who have shown a willingness to buck the establishment. “We do have electoral systems that are producing outcomes the governing parties didn’t want,” said Ben Ansell, a professor of comparative democratic institutions at the University of Oxford. “They’ve all been destabilized by a tricky economic environment, and behaving like strongmen hasn’t saved them.” Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan remain in power, each now in his third term. But Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., lost dozens of seats and will have to govern in a coalition with two secular parties. Turkey’s opposition struck a blow against Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party in April, winning a string of local elections and solidifying its control of important cities like Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. “In a lot of countries where there’s been talk of backsliding, that’s where we’ve seen a bounce back,” Professor Ansell said. “For Modi and Erdogan, taking the sheen off their infallibility was very important.” With so many elections in so many countries, it is dangerous to generalize. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia rolled up 88 percent of the vote in a landslide re-election victory in March that spoke less to Russian public sentiment and more to the ability of an autocrat, facing no meaningful opposition, to stage-manage a show of support for his war in Ukraine. In Europe, far-right parties are expected to perform well in European Parliament elections, which began on Thursday. Analysts said they did not believe this would jeopardize the political center that has governed Europe in the post-World War II era. And Poland provided a source of reassurance last fall, when voters pushed out its nationalist Law and Justice Party in favor of a more liberal opposition. Still, the success of far-right figures like Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy, attests to the enduring appeal of populism. “Populists and right-wingers will continue to make gains and strike fear into the European political establishment,” the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said in its analysis of the top risks of 2024. Britain’s general election was shaken up on Monday when Nigel Farage, a populist politician, pro-Brexit campaigner and ally of former President Donald J. Trump, announced he would run for a seat in Parliament under the banner of his Reform U.K. party, which has a strident anti-immigration message. That will add to the headache for the Conservative Party, which has lagged the opposition Labour Party by double digits in polls for nearly 18 months. Reform, which is fielding candidates across the country, could siphon off Conservative votes among those who blame the party for a weak economy and rising immigration numbers since Britain left the European Union in 2020. Some critics argue that the Conservative Party’s problems stem from its free-market policies, which they say have disillusioned voters in disadvantaged parts of Britain and set it apart from right-wing parties in Europe or Mr. Trump’s Make America Great Again movement in the United States. More fundamentally, though, the Conservatives have been in power for 14 years, and they face the same pent-up dissatisfaction with the status quo that fueled the recent elections in India, South Africa and Turkey. In some countries, the urge to break with the past has led voters to make unorthodox choices: Javier Milei, a flamboyant libertarian economist, swept to power in Argentina last November with a promise to close its central bank and wage an all-out assault on what he described as a corrupt political “caste.” Some analysts argue that similarly disruptive forces are driving the presidential race in the United States, where a comparatively healthy economy and the advantages of incumbency have not spared President Biden, who faces a neck-and-neck challenge from Mr. Trump even after the former president was convicted of multiple felonies. “It’s not about left versus right, it’s about the status quo versus change,” said Frank Luntz, an American political strategist who has lived and worked in Britain. “You can’t buy a house in the U.K., the N.H.S. doesn’t work,” he said, referring to the National Health Service. “In the United States, you can’t afford housing or health care. It’s about broken promises, year after year after year.” That sense of betrayal is even more acute in countries like South Africa, where the African National Congress, or A.N.C., has governed since the start of democracy there in 1994, piling up majorities even as the economy and social infrastructure crumbled. Last week, voters finally rebelled, driving down the A.N.C.’s vote share to 40 percent, from 58 percent in the last national election in 2019. Among their biggest complaints is the lack of job opportunities: South Africa’s unemployment rate — at 42 percent, including those who have stopped looking for work — is one of the highest in the world. Stagnation has widened the country’s already profound inequality. South Africans flock to cities looking for work. But many end up in decrepit buildings and slapdash shack communities, often without running water or sanitary toilets. Regular power outages leave streets dark and residents of many communities vulnerable to crime. South Africa’s murder rate is six and a half times as high as that of the United States and 45 times as high as Germany’s. Jacob Zuma, the scandal-scarred former president, has benefited from this misery, helping start a new party, umKhonto weSizwe, or M.K., which won nearly 15 percent of the vote, mostly at the expense of his former party, the A.N.C. Mr. Zuma attracts a feverish following among disillusioned A.N.C. supporters, who accuse the party of selling out to wealthy white businesspeople and not moving aggressively enough to redistribute wealth to the Black majority after apartheid. India’s election was a comparable anti-incumbent revolt, even if Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. is still the largest party in Parliament by a wide margin. The party’s campaign spending was at least 20 times as much as that of its main opposition, the Congress Party, which had its bank accounts frozen by the government in a tax dispute on the eve of the election. The country’s news outlets have been largely bought off or bullied into silence. And yet, the results showed Mr. Modi, 73, losing his majority for the first time since he took office in 2014. Analysts said that reflected widespread dissatisfaction with how the fruits of India’s economy have been shared. While India’s steady growth has made it the envy of its neighbors — and created a conspicuous billionaire class — those riches have not flowed to the hundreds of millions of India’s poor. The government has handed out free rations of wheat, grain and cooking gas. It offers home water connections, subsidizes building supplies and gives farmers cash. But it has not tackled India’s inflation or unemployment, leaving hundreds of millions of people, especially women, chronically out of work. There is also some evidence that Mr. Modi’s appeals to Hindu nationalism were not as potent as in previous elections. The B.J.P.’s candidate did not even win the constituency that is home to the lavish Ram temple, built on grounds disputed by Hindus and Muslims. Mr. Modi inaugurated the temple just before the campaign started, hoping it would galvanize his Hindu political base. The economy figured into Mexico’s election as well, but in a very different way. While overall growth was disappointing — averaging only 1 percent a year during Mr. López Obrador’s term — the government doubled the minimum wage and strengthened the peso, lifting millions of Mexicans out of poverty. “People vote with their wallets, and it’s very obvious there’s more money in the wallets of almost everybody in Mexico,” said Diego Casteñeda Garza, a Mexican economist and historian at Uppsala University in Sweden. Still, analysts said, there was also a desire among voters to cement the change that Mr. López Obrador, a charismatic outsider, symbolized when he came to power in 2018. Even as Ms. Sheinbaum, 61, vowed to continue her mentor’s policies, she cast herself — Mexico’s first female and Jewish president — as a change agent. For Jacqueline González, 33, who works at a cargo transportation company and viewed Mexico’s previous governments as corrupt, that made voting for Ms. Sheinbaum an easy decision. “With Obrador we have already seen, although some people don’t want to admit it, some change,” Ms. González said. “Let’s hope it continues with Sheinbaum.”",india powerful leader win another term see party majority vanish

nytimes,"Rahul Gandhi, Long on the Ropes, Looks Set for an Unexpected Comeback","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-congress-rahul-gandhi.html,"Just last year, Rahul Gandhi and the once-powerful party he led, the Indian National Congress, seemed to be on the ropes and little threat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s consolidation of political power. Congress had not been a competitive factor in national elections in years, winning fewer and fewer votes each time Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party was elected. And Mr. Gandhi himself had been convicted on a slander charge and barred from holding a seat in Parliament. But on Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi and a broad opposition coalition led by his Congress party registered a far stronger showing than expected in India’s elections, setting the stage for an unlikely comeback. “He has finally arrived,” said Rasheed Kidwai, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi. “This time he has improved his vote share by at least 17 million votes, which is very substantial.” On Wednesday, Mr. Modi’s party announced that it had reached an agreement to form a governing coalition, including two parties that do not necessarily share its vision. Congress won 99 seats in the 543-seat Parliament, a gain of 47 seats, and the alliance of which it is the leading part won a total of 232. Congress and its alliance of over two dozen political groups have presented the results as a “moral victory” over a B.J.P. government that they say was trying to change the country’s Constitution and have portrayed as anathema to India’s identity as a multifaith and secular country. “The fight was to save the Constitution,” Mr. Gandhi, the son, grandson and great-grandson of Congress prime ministers, said as the results poured in. The first major sign that Congress might be able to contend came in May 2023, just a couple of months after Mr. Gandhi’s conviction for slander, when his party won the state government of Karnataka, in the south of India, from the B.J.P. The lift was temporary; Congress soon lost power in three states it governed to the B.J.P. But at the same time, political experts say, Mr. Gandhi was pushing for changes within the party, India’s oldest, which had long resisted overhauling an archaic organizational structure that kept its top leaders isolated from the grass-roots workers who deliver votes. Feelings that Congress’s leaders were corrupt and out of touch resulted in a string of defeats over a number of years and then degenerated into messy infighting within the party. For the past two years, party members say, Mr. Gandhi has tried to reverse the decline of Congress by surrounding himself with young policy analysts to help him understand the challenges facing India, as well as party veterans with their ears to the ground in towns and villages that Congress was targeting. The party has in addition improved its social media game, trumpeting its messages on platforms like WhatsApp and YouTube. Mr. Gandhi also raised his profile by embarking on two walks across India — meeting farmers in their fields and vegetable sellers on city streets; and drinking tea with recent graduates and gig workers — in an effort to show common cause with ordinary people. Perhaps most important, Congress focused on a strategy of reaching out to and cooperating with key regional players across the country whose influence had dimmed under B.J.P. rule. Congress leaders made a series of “seat-sharing” agreements with regional leaders, big and small, that strengthened the alliance against Mr. Modi’s party. To avoid splitting the anti-B.J.P. vote, Congress had its own candidates contest fewer seats. And Mr. Gandhi campaigned vigorously alongside the leaders of like-minded political groups across India. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Gandhi also won support, party leaders say, by characterizing Mr. Modi as a leader who would destroy India’s secular character. “It is a victory not just for him and our alliance partners but for the millions of poor Indians who voted to protect the secular fabric of this country,” said Srinivas B.V., another Congress leader, about Mr. Gandhi. “People showed Modi: ‘You are not God, and you can be replaced.’” Since being voted to power in 2014, Mr. Modi has sought to position Hinduism, the religion of some 80 percent of Indians, at the center of the country’s official identity. He also promised to end corruption, overhaul the economy and help India become a “developed nation” by 2047. But after his re-election in 2019, he leaned into Hindu themes to a greater extent. Mr. Gandhi’s efforts to contrast his vision for India with Mr. Modi’s largely paid off, analysts say, even if some members of his party jumped ship and sided with the B.J.P. Many of the politicians who defected from Congress to the B.J.P. lost their seats, including in West Bengal and Maharashtra, where Congress and its partners did especially well. Throughout the campaign Mr. Gandhi persistently linked Mr. Modi with Gautam Adani, Asia’s richest man, saying the prime minister was working for his tycoon friends, not for the vast majority of Indians who are poor. As if to vindicate this line of attack, over the two days after the election results were announced, the price of Mr. Adani’s flagship stock fell by 14 percent. (It then recovered somewhat on Wednesday.) “People directly correlate Adani Ji with Modi Ji — directly,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters after the results, using Hindi honorifics for the two men. Researchers who traveled across India during the voting said Mr. Gandhi had beaten Mr. Modi on his own turf in many places by focusing on issues like the millions of Indians without jobs and the economic difficulties faced by farmers. He also accused the B.J.P. of governance failures and worked with local political groups fighting for social justice and for the empowerment of lower-caste Indians. Uttar Pradesh, where Mr. Modi made dozens of visits to campaign for local candidates, is one state where the changing fortunes of the two largest political groupings was evident. The state is India’s largest, and accounts for 80 of the Parliament’s 543 seats. The B.J.P. recorded its worst performance there since 2009, in part because Mr. Gandhi was able to craft an alliance with a powerful local leader, Akhilesh Yadav. In addition to the 37 seats picked up by Mr. Yadav’s Samajwadi Party, Congress won six, helped by aggressive campaigning by Mr. Gandhi’s sister, Priyanka Vadra, who helped defeat a former soap-opera actress who had served as a minister in Mr. Modi’s government. The B.J.P. won 33 seats, down from 62 in the previous Parliament. The election results announced on Wednesday have given a major lift to hundreds of thousands of Congress workers across the country, who were growing tired of the internal infighting that has plagued their party for years. Outside Congress headquarters in New Delhi, Bansi Lal Meena, a veteran Congress member from the state of Rajasthan, was exultant about his party’s performance. “In villages and on the ground, the B.J.P. spread lies for years against us — saying that we are anti-Hindu,” he said. “They used my religion as a weapon against me to win votes.” He added: “We will show them now because our people are also in Parliament.”",last year rahul gandhi oncepowerful party led indian national congress seemed rope little threat prime minister narendra modis consolidation political power congress competitive

nytimes,Narendra Modi Fell to Earth After Making It All About Himself,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-election-modi.html,"When everything became about Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, his party and its century-old Hindu-nationalist network were propelled to unimagined heights. On the back of his singular charisma and political skill, a onetime-fringe religious ideology was pulled to the center of Indian life. Landslide election victories remade India’s politics, once dominated by diverse coalitions representing a nation that had shaped its independence on secular principles. But there were always risks in wrapping a party’s fortunes so completely in the image of one man, in inundating a country of many religions, castes and cultures with that leader’s name, face and voice. Voters could start to think that everything was about him, not them. They could even revolt. On Tuesday, Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., fell back to earth. After having promised their biggest election romp yet, they lost more than 60 seats. Mr. Modi will remain in office for a third term, but only with the help of a contentious coalition of parties, some of which are opposed to his core beliefs and want power of their own. With the result, India’s strained democracy appeared to roar back to life, its beaten-down political opposition reinvigorated. And after a decade in which Mr. Modi’s success in entrenching Hindu supremacy had often felt like the new common sense, India is seeing its leader and itself in a new light, and trying to understand this unexpected turn. Most fundamentally, the opposition, newly coalesced for what it called a do-or-die moment as Mr. Modi increasingly tilted the playing field, found a way to use the cult of personality around him to its advantage. Opposition leaders focused on bread-and-butter issues, often at granular levels in particular constituencies. They hammered Mr. Modi over persistent unemployment and stark inequality. But the B.J.P., with Mr. Modi from on high its only spokesman, was often left with just one answer: Trust in “Modi’s guarantee.” “The ‘Modi’s guarantee’ slogan turned out to be our undoing,” said Ajay Singh Gaur, a B.J.P. worker who had campaigned in the party stronghold of Uttar Pradesh, the northern state where Mr. Modi suffered his biggest blow on Tuesday, losing nearly half of the B.J.P. seats. “The opposition made that sound like this was not about him having delivered, or trying to deliver,” Mr. Gaur said, “but about him being an arrogant politician.” Mr. Modi gave his adversaries a lot to work with, even declaring that he may not be “biological” and that he had been sent by God. He has still emerged better so far than other Indian leaders who deeply centralized power. He remains in control of levers of power that could help him and his party restore their dominance. Indira Gandhi, who had also glorified herself and went so far as to suspend India’s democracy after declaring a national emergency, was voted out at the peak of her powers before returning three years later. But Mr. Modi’s B.J.P., the world’s largest political party, finds itself in a tough spot after years of centralization and reliance on a government machinery put to the service of one man, analysts say. The huge advantage the party has built in numbers and resources is undercut by a lack of internal consultation and delegation of authority. That was a key reason for its failure in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, with 240 million people, and surrounding states. Local B.J.P. leaders were disenchanted by a top-down approach toward choosing candidates, as well as what they called a misguided belief that Mr. Modi’s popularity could allow the party to sidestep potent local issues and caste factors. With Mr. Modi sucking up all the oxygen at the top, other senior leaders of the party have been left to fight for relevance and a voice. His relentless self-promotion has also alienated the leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., the B.J.P.’s right-wing fountainhead. During election seasons, the R.S.S. activates its vast grass-roots network in support of B.J.P. candidates. While Mr. Modi, a former foot soldier in the organization, has advanced many of its goals, his consolidation of power goes against its regimented nature and its focus on ideology over individual personalities. One R.S.S. insider, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking, said that Mr. Modi’s exalting of himself had created such resentment inside the group that some of its leaders welcomed any sort of reality check for him, short of his ouster. Sudheendra Kulkarni, a political analyst who served as an aide to the first B.J.P. prime minister in the 1990s, said Mr. Modi had pushed through unpopular legislation — in particular farm laws that prompted a yearlong protest that choked New Delhi — without consulting with party officials in the affected states. They were left to cope with the ramifications. “The B.J.P. was never a one-leader party,” Mr. Kulkarni said. “All that changed with Narendra Modi in 2014. He sought to promote a new authoritarian idea of one nation, one leader.” Hypothesizing that Mr. Modi’s popularity had peaked, the opposition saw an opening to go after a decisive section of votes in the Indian political formula. For decades before his rise in 2014, neither the B.J.P. nor the Indian National Congress, the country’s two largest parties, could muster majorities on its own. Mr. Modi expanded his party’s backing by consolidating right-wing Hindu voters and drawing in new supporters with his personal story of a humble caste and economic background and a promise to change lives through robust development. A decade later, in this year’s election, the opposition found traction in painting a very different picture of Mr. Modi — as an autocratic friend of billionaires. Since Mr. Modi had achieved everything he had set out to do, the opposition argued, his pursuit of a resounding majority could only mean that he would seek radical change to the Constitution. That claim stirred anxiety among India’s Dalits and other underprivileged groups, who see the Constitution as their only protection in a deeply unequal society, guaranteeing them a share of government jobs and seats in higher education as well as elected bodies. The opposition was able to push the message harder when some in Mr. Modi’s right-wing support base, long seen as having an upper-caste bias, called for revoking the quotas. Caste identity was a major driving factor for voters in many states, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, with its 80 parliamentary seats. The decline of a Dalit party in the state meant that about 20 percent of the votes were potentially up for grabs. In Ayodhya, the constituency where Mr. Modi inaugurated a grand Ram temple earlier this year in an effort to consolidate his Hindu support base, the opposition put up a Dalit candidate. He handily defeated the B.J.P.’s two-term incumbent. In other cases, voters showed their anger over the B.J.P.’s perceived sense of impunity. In Kheri, a constituency where the son of a B.J.P. minister rammed his S.U.V. into a crowd of protesting farmers, killing several, the minister also lost. Mr. Modi’s election campaign took its most divisive turn in Banswara, in the desert state of Rajasthan, where he called India’s 200 million Muslims “infiltrators” and raised fears that the opposition would give them India’s wealth, including Hindu women’s necklaces. Banswara’s B.J.P. incumbent was routed in the election. While the loss was most likely attributable to local issues, the national discussion noted that Mr. Modi’s comments had not helped. In his own constituency of Varanasi, in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Modi’s winning margin of nearly half a million votes in 2019 shrank to about 150,000 — a disappointing showing after he had dispatched some of the B.J.P.’s most senior leaders to camp out there to help him achieve an even bigger victory. Jai Prakash, a tea and samosa seller in Varanasi, said some of the prime minister’s work, particularly his improvement of roads, was popular. But Mr. Modi was losing the plot, Mr. Prakash said, by turning to issues disconnected from people’s day-to-day lives. “Prices are skyrocketing; so is unemployment,” Mr. Prakash said. “He has done some good. But people cannot worship him endlessly.”",everything became prime minister narendra modi india party centuryold hindunationalist network propelled unimagined height back singular charisma political

nytimes,"India Keeps Its Glorious, Messy Tradition Alive","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/opinion/india-election-modi-bjp-democracy.html,"Back in January, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India looked all but unstoppable, he visited the small city of Ayodhya for the unofficial start of his campaign to win a third term. The location was freighted with symbolism. For decades, Hindu nationalists had sought to build a temple in Ayodhya, at a spot they believe to be the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. The only problem was that there was already a house of worship on the spot, a mosque built by a Mughal emperor in 1528. A Hindu mob had dismantled the mosque in 1992, setting off riots that killed 2,000 people, most of them Muslims. The ruins were a flashpoint of religious tensions in India for decades. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party promised to build the temple, and the lavish event at which Modi officially opened it was a showcase for that achievement. At the time it seemed like strong election-year messaging for a politician who built his career on the twin planks of Hindu nationalism and building a muscular new India. Unlike other politicians, the event implied, Modi made promises and kept them. “It is the beginning of a new era,” he declared. Feeling supremely confident, Modi had boldly asked the Indian electorate for something akin to a blank check to remake the country — control of 400 seats in Parliament in elections that began in April and concluded on June 1. And why shouldn’t he have been confident? India’s economy was the fastest-growing in the world. India had overtaken China as the world’s most-populous country. World leaders sought Modi’s support on issues ranging from the war in Ukraine to the climate crisis, cementing India’s ascent in global affairs. But the ever unpredictable electorate of the world’s largest democracy responded to Modi’s demand for still more power resolutely: No thanks. In a stunning rebuke, election results released on Tuesday showed that India’s voters have reduced the parliamentary share of Modi’s party by more than 60 seats, not enough for an outright majority, never mind the supermajority he had sought. It struck me as particularly apt that despite all the fanfare about the glorious new temple in Ayodhya, Modi’s party lost the city’s parliamentary seat to a political opposition that had been all but left for dead. There appears to be a clear ceiling to the appeals to Hindu identity on its own. “We are very happy with the temple, but people were fed up with the B.J.P.,” a local business leader, Rakesh Yadav, told Reuters. “People will not always fall for the caste or temple-mosque politics. They also want to see development.” This is a big year for democracy, almost a referendum of sorts on the very idea. Dozens of countries are holding elections, representing roughly half of the world’s population. But authoritarianism has been on the march. The latest report from Freedom House found that by many measures, global freedom has declined for the 18th straight year. India, despite its status as the world’s most-populous democracy, has been a poster child for this decline under Modi: His government has taken aim at just about every form of freedom. He has attacked and grievously weakened the independence of India’s once boisterous press. He has jailed critics and political opponents. He has sharpened religious animosity, referring during this campaign to Muslims, who make up 14 percent of India’s population, as “infiltrators” who seek to steal wealth and power from the Hindu majority. It’s an Indian edition of the nationalist, populist playbook playing out around the world. That a newly unified opposition managed to prevent Modi’s party from winning an outright majority under these conditions took everyone, including me, by surprise. And it suggests that even when would-be authoritarians attempt to tilt the playing field, voters can and will state their will, no matter the autocrat’s preferences. “The B.J.P. had positioned itself as a new hegemonic power,” Yamini Aiyar, a scholar and analyst of Indian democracy who has been a frequent target of Hindu nationalist rage, told me. “The beauty of an election is that politicians have to go to the people, and the people get an opportunity to express their anxieties and their perspectives.” Express them they did. Looking back, the weakness of the B.J.P.’s re-election case is clear: Yes, India’s economy was growing fast. But despite the flashy new infrastructure projects and deals to increase high-tech manufacturing, the growth was not creating nearly enough jobs, and inflation remained stubbornly high, especially for food, which hits the poorest hardest. Much of the wealth generated by growth has gone to India’s richest tycoons, and inequality has soared. “The reality is that the real economy has been hurting for a very long time, and they have systematically sought to ignore it,” Aiyar said. India has managed to lift millions of people out of poverty since Modi came to power 10 years ago, but particularly in rural areas, where most Indians live, that has meant social welfare rather than jobs. There were other issues too — Modi’s allies had floated the idea of changing India’s Constitution in various ways, including removing its commitment to secularism and enshrining Hinduism as the national faith. These kinds of appeals have helped the B.J.P. in the past but seem to have had less power this time around. One clear sign was its heavy losses in Uttar Pradesh, which is not just India’s most populous state; it is also part of the heavily Hindu heartland of northern India. It also seems that the opposition may finally have gotten its act together. India’s main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, has been in decline for years and had struggled to make common cause with other opposition parties in previous elections. But this year the opposition parties managed to make a much stronger coalition. They focused on kitchen table issues and highlighted the Modi government’s ties to big business and high-flying billionaires. The opposition didn’t shy away from making the stakes for Indian democracy clear. But the relentless focus on what voters said mattered most offers lessons for those battling revanchist movements elsewhere, including in the United States. Sometimes you need to meet voters where they are. This vote wasn’t a total rebuke of Modi and his policies. He is all but certain to get his third term as prime minister by making a coalition with allied parties. But it is a clear and salutary check on his authoritarian project. This election is also a rebuke of Indian elites — in business and media especially — who had willingly surrendered to a kind of inevitability of Modi’s long-term consolidation of power, making peace with it or even celebrating it. Activists, analysts and journalists who had the temerity to speak plainly about Modi’s revanchist project and the threat he posed to the world’s biggest democracy and its long history of tolerance, secularism and free speech have been hounded out of public life. I hope that this troubling slide ends now. As the results rolled in on Tuesday, I remembered my own reporting trip to Ayodhya in 2009, when I was a correspondent for The Times based in India. An explosive new government report had just been issued about the destruction of the mosque and the role of Hindu nationalist groups in stirring up violence. But when I got there, I was surprised to find that on the hotly contested spot itself there was hardly any hoopla. The crowds of Hindu nationalist volunteers who for years had routinely shown up to build the temple with their bare hands had disappeared. India was going through a period of hopeful prosperity. Voters had just returned the Indian National Congress party and its allies to power with a larger majority, and a brilliant, teetotaling economist named Manmohan Singh was prime minister. With the future looking so alluring, no one seemed all that interested in litigating the past. These hopes were ultimately dashed amid scandals over political corruption and mismanagement. The Congress party, which once seemed unstoppable, lost power in 2014 for failing to deliver on its promise to bring India to its long-awaited place among the world’s richest and most powerful nations. The years ahead will, with any luck, be ones of negotiation and compromise. This will be a return to form for India, a vastly diverse nation whose unruly polity has resisted autocracy at every turn since it shrugged off British colonial rule in 1947. The whole world should breathe a sigh of relief that India’s voters have spoken, loudly, in favor of continuing that glorious, messy tradition.",back january prime minister narendra modi india looked

nytimes,The New Kingmakers Who Could Make or Break Modi’s Government,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-elections-modi-coalition.html,"After his first two national election victories, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India easily set his own terms, with his Bharatiya Janata Party winning clear majorities. The result was different in this vote. It was still a victory, but one that left him dependent on a host of coalition partners — particularly on politicians from two regional parties who could make or break Mr. Modi’s ability to form a government. Of the more than a dozen parties that make up the B.J.P.’s coalition, known as the National Democratic Alliance, most won just one or two seats, leaving the party in a difficult predicament. On Wednesday, the B.J.P. said it had reached an agreement to form a coalition government that includes those two regional parties — the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United. They will be the biggest junior partners, but they are also avowedly secular and removed from Mr. Modi’s Hindu-nationalist ideology. Cameras on Wednesday followed every word, meeting and movement of the leaders of the two parties, N. Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party, and Nitish Kumar of Janata Dal-United. Their combined 28 seats in Parliament will give the prime minister the votes he needs to stay in power and push through his agenda. Here is what to know about the men who unexpectedly found themselves as kingmakers, and about the parties they lead. Though some of the members of the B.J.P.’s coalition this year share Mr. Modi’s hard-line vision, both the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United are moderate, secular parties that have a diverse support base. Speculation in India was focusing on what terms the men were demanding for their support, which are unlikely to be rooted in ideology. Both Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar are known to be pragmatic, deal-making politicians whose priorities will be practical concessions for their state, or perhaps cabinet positions. Mr. Kumar has earned a reputation in India for his willingness to switch allegiances over the past decade. He has gone between aligning himself with the B.J.P.-led coalition to supporting its rivals no fewer than five times. Most recently, in January, he returned to Mr. Modi’s alliance just 18 months after he’d left it and with just months to go until the election. He has said his switching of political loyalties was in the interest of his state, Bihar. Mr. Naidu has also at times broken with Mr. Modi, cutting ties with the B.J.P. in 2018 and joining forces with its chief rival, Indian National Congress, ahead of the 2019 elections. He has said that his party has aligned with the B.J.P. out of “political compulsion.” Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar have both been in politics for decades, and have been mentioned as potential candidates for prime minister. Mr. Naidu of the T.D.P., based in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, is a technocrat who has aggressively pushed for investment from information technology companies in his region. His policies helped bring high-paying jobs for I.T. professionals and transformed the city of Hyderabad. Mr. Kumar is a nine-time chief minister of Bihar, India’s poorest state, who comes from a homegrown socialist background. He has pushed for more funds for low-caste Hindus, and his alliance with the B.J.P. broadened support for the party in his state.",first two national election victory prime minister narendra modi india easily set term bharatiya janata party winning clear majority result different vote still victory one left dependent host coalition partner particularly politician two regional party could make break mr modis ability form government dozen party make bjps coalition known national democratic alliance one two seat leaving party difficult predicament wednesday bjp said reached agreement form coalition government includes two regional party telugu desam party janata dalunited biggest junior partner also avowedly secular removed mr modis hindunationalist ideology camera wednesday followed every word meeting movement leader two party n chandrababu naidu telugu desam party nitish kumar janata dalunited combined seat parliament give prime minister vote need stay power push agenda know men unexpectedly found kingmaker party lead though member bjps coalition year share mr modis hardline vision telugu desam party janata dalunited moderate secular party diverse support base speculation india focusing term men demanding support unlikely rooted ideology mr naidu mr kumar known pragmatic dealmaking politician whose priority practical concession state perhaps cabinet position mr kumar earned reputation india willingness switch allegiance past decade gone aligning bjpled coalition supporting rival fewer five time recently january returned mr modis alliance month hed left month go election said switching political loyalty interest state bihar mr naidu also time broken mr modi cutting tie bjp joining force chief rival indian national congress ahead election said party aligned bjp political compulsion mr naidu mr kumar politics decade mentioned potential candidate prime minister mr naidu tdp based southern state andhra pradesh technocrat aggressively pushed investment information technology company region policy helped bring highpaying job professional transformed city hyderabad mr kumar ninetime chief minister bihar india poorest state come homegrown socialist background pushed fund lowcaste hindu alliance bjp broadened support party state
nytimes,"Modi se reelige en India, pero pierde mayoría parlamentaria: 4 claves de las elecciones","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/06/05/espanol/elecciones-india-modi.html,"[Estamos en WhatsApp. Empieza a seguirnos ahora] La primera década de Narendra Modi como primer ministro de India ha estado plagada de sorpresas. Ninguna, sin embargo, se comparó con lo que ocurrió el martes por la mañana, cuando Modi ganó su segunda reelección, pero su partido perdió la mayoría en el Parlamento. Con esa derrota, el aire de invencibilidad de Modi también pareció desvanecerse por primera vez desde que asumió el cargo en 2014. Los resultados de las elecciones fueron particularmente interesantes porque, tras casi siete semanas de votaciones en todo el país, las encuestas a pie de urna publicadas pocos días antes del recuento final mostraban que el Partido Popular Indio de Modi ganaría de forma aplastante, como ya había hecho en dos ocasiones anteriores. Sin embargo, el Partido Popular Indio solo obtuvo 239 escaños, muy por debajo de los 272 necesarios para formar gobierno. La alianza de la oposición, liderada por el Partido del Congreso Nacional Indio, obtuvo 235 escaños. Con los 52 escaños obtenidos por los aliados del Partido Popular Indio, Modi seguirá a la cabeza. Pero su atractivo ha disminuido y su liderazgo ha cambiado radicalmente. Cuando Modi llegó al poder en 2014, prometió progreso económico, el fin de la corrupción y la promoción del hinduismo como elemento central de la identidad india. Con todo ello, se presentó como un líder singularmente fuerte, capaz de reunir a sus seguidores para trabajar por la nación. Esto contrastaba con el gobierno anterior. Antes de que Modi fuera elegido por primera vez, India llevaba 25 años gobernada por coaliciones. Los primeros ministros del Partido del Congreso, del Partido Popular Indio y de terceros partidos más pequeños se alternaban para dirigir India por comités. Modi rompió con esa tradición y lideró un nuevo sistema de partido único dominado por el Partido Popular Indio. Como líder, Modi mostró poco interés en compartir el poder. Cuando invalidó la mayor parte del papel moneda de India en 2016, ni siquiera su ministro de Finanzas conocía la decisión de antemano. Cuando decidió imponer la ley marcial en Jammu y Cachemira, el único estado de mayoría musulmana de India, presentó el plan al Parlamento como un hecho, sin pedir su aprobación. Pero esos días han terminado. Los dos mayores partidos que han surgido como nuevos socios de coalición del Partido Popular Indio están liderados por N. Chandrababu Naidu y Nitish Kumar, legisladores veteranos a quienes se conoce como tecnócratas moderados. Es probable que ambos exijan más autoridad en el Parlamento. De hecho, ambos han sido señalados como posibles candidatos a primer ministro, si se produjera otra coalición que no estuviera liderada ni por el Partido Popular Indio ni por el Congreso Nacional Indio. Cuando el martes se dieron a conocer los primeros mapas electorales nacionales que mostraban el número de escaños ganados y perdidos en el Parlamento, se observó una nueva y sorprendente configuración. Los mapas mostraban que el partido de Modi había perdido zonas de territorio en los estados del norte de habla hindi, considerados bastiones del Partido Popular Indio. Al mismo tiempo, el su partido avanzó en regiones que se habían resistido a Modi en el pasado. Perdió decenas de escaños en el estado septentrional de Uttar Pradesh, pero ganó muchos en el estado oriental de Odisha y en el estado meridional de Telangana. La única parte del país que ahora parece unificada por un partido es el “cinturón tribal”, que atraviesa los estados centrales. Sus comunidades relativamente pobres han sido hábilmente puestas en la mira de la política hinduista y los beneficios sociales del Partido Popular Indio. Los inversores de los mercados bursátiles indios de Mumbai respondieron con entusiasmo a las primeras encuestas a pie de urna. El lunes, se lanzaron a la compra, haciendo subir los precios de las llamadas acciones de Modi, aquellas asociadas a las prioridades de gasto del primer ministro o que se cree que se benefician de sus políticas fiscales. Cuando se conocieron los resultados de las urnas, esas acciones se desplomaron. Las acciones del buque insignia del Grupo Adani perdieron cerca del 19 por ciento de su valor en un solo día de cotización. El índice bursátil perdió cerca del 6 por ciento, casi anulando las ganancias de los cinco primeros meses del año. Modi sigue siendo popular entre los magnates de India, pero los inversores deben averiguar qué empresas se beneficiarán del nuevo gobierno. Chris Wood, responsable mundial de estrategia de renta variable del banco de inversión Jefferies, advirtió el año pasado que si Modi perdía, “cabría esperar una corrección del 25 por ciento, si no más”, en el mercado bursátil indio. Históricamente, a las empresas indias les ha ido igual de bien durante los periodos de gobierno de coalición. Por lo tanto, Wood dijo que, incluso sin Modi en el poder, espera que las acciones “se recuperen bruscamente” sobre la base de la fortaleza de la economía del país en su conjunto. Esta nueva era en el Parlamento empezará seguramente con algunas rondas de retribuciones políticas. Los políticos que no hayan conseguido escaños para sus jefes serán despedidos. Es probable que los partidos más pequeños exijan puestos en el gabinete, lo que significará sustituir a miembros del Partido Popular Indio. Habrá que revisar las políticas. ¿Se inclinará India por la exportación de manufacturas, con el objetivo de sustituir a China como la fábrica del mundo? ¿Protegerá ahora a las industrias locales que temen la competencia extranjera? Milan Vaishnav, investigador de la Fundación Carnegie para la Paz Internacional, advirtió que India no puede volver exactamente a la política de coalición que precedió a Modi. Es probable que sus nuevos socios exijan un estilo autoritario similar al que Modi ejerce desde Nueva Delhi. El tipo de líderes estatales que necesita ahora como socios de coalición “son tan absolutistas como el gobierno nacional”, dijo Vaishnav. Podrían, por ejemplo, pedir a la policía federal que detuviera a sus oponentes, como ha hecho Modi. Las elecciones de India fueron las mayores celebradas en la historia de la democracia, con más de 600 millones de votantes en seis fases. Esta vez no hubo quejas sobre las máquinas de votación electrónica, ni temores de que India se hubiera convertido en una dictadura bajo el mandato de Modi. En un discurso difícil pronunciado el martes por la noche desde la sede del Partido Popular Indio, Modi calificó las elecciones de “celebración de la democracia”.",estamos en whatsapp empieza

nytimes,Man Accused in Plot to Assassinate Sikh Separatist Pleads Not Guilty,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/nyregion/nikhil-gupta-india-assassination-plot.html,"An Indian man pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of orchestrating a failed assassination plot against a Sikh separatist in New York, a plan that prosecutors say he devised on behalf of an unnamed official in India’s government. The defendant, Nikhil Gupta, 52, was arrested in the Czech Republic a year ago, and was extradited last week to make his first appearance in Manhattan federal court. He is accused of trying to arrange the murder of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American citizen and lawyer for a New York-based Sikh secessionist group. The murder attempt, which played out against a backdrop of doubt about India’s commitment to democracy, spanned several countries and mirrored the successful killing of another separatist in Canada, prosecutors say. On Monday morning, Mr. Gupta entered the Lower Manhattan courtroom in a blue cardigan and yellow patterned shirt and appeared relaxed as he spoke to his lawyer, Jeffrey Chabrowe, at the defense table. He has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since landing in the United States on Friday afternoon. In a statement to reporters after the arraignment, Mr. Chabrowe called the case a “complex matter"" for India and the United States. “Background and details will develop that may cast government allegations into an entirely new light,” he said. Mr. Gupta is charged with murder for hire and conspiracy to commit murder for hire. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison for each charge. He was sent back to the detention center after Monday’s arraignment and is set to appear in court again on June 28. In a statement Monday, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said Mr. Gupta will “now face justice” in an American courtroom. “This extradition makes clear that the Justice Department will not tolerate attempts to silence or harm American citizens,” he said. In an indictment unsealed in November, Manhattan federal prosecutors described an audacious plot that began around May 2023 when an Indian government employee enlisted Mr. Gupta to organize the killing of Mr. Pannun, who was living in New York at the time. Mr. Pannun is the general counsel of Sikhs for Justice, an organization that supports the secession of Punjab, a state in northern India. He is a vocal critic of the Indian government and has been banned from the country, prosecutors say. Mr. Gupta, who lived in India, had told the government official about “his involvement in international narcotics and weapons trafficking,” according to the indictment. At the direction of the Indian government employee, Mr. Gupta contacted a man who he believed would help him hire a hit man in New York, but who was, in fact, an agent for the American government. That agent introduced Mr. Gupta to an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration officer who pretended to be the hit man. In deals brokered by Mr. Gupta, the Indian government official agreed to pay the D.E.A. officer $100,000 to kill Mr. Pannun, including a $15,000 cash advance for the job, prosecutors said. Mr. Gupta then shared personal information about Mr. Pannun with the undercover officer, including Mr. Pannun’s address in New York and his phone number. When the Indian official asked for updates, Mr. Gupta relayed surveillance photos of Mr. Pannun that the agent had sent him. Mr. Gupta instructed the undercover officer to carry out the assassination as soon as possible, but asked him not to do it around the time of high-level meetings between U.S. and Indian officials, according to the indictment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington and met with President Biden in June 2023. Then, prosecutors said, on June 18 of that year, gunmen killed Hardeep Singh Nijjar, another Sikh separatist leader, in British Columbia, Canada. Mr. Nijjar knew Mr. Pannun and was also an outspoken critic of the Indian government. Soon after, prosecutors said, Mr. Gupta told the undercover officer that Mr. Nijjar “was also the target” and that “we have so many targets.” Mr. Gupta then told the officer — the pretend hit man — that there was “now no need to wait” to kill Mr. Pannun, prosecutors said. On Monday, Mr. Pannun said in a statement that he had “full faith” that the United States would hold Mr. Gupta and his co-conspirators accountable. “The attempt on my life on American soil is the blatant case of India’s transnational terrorism challenging America’s sovereignty and unequivocally proves that Modi’s India believes in using violence to suppress the dissenting political opinion,” he said. A spokesman for the Indian Embassy in Washington, D.C., could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. Mr. Gupta’s case has threatened to complicate the delicate relations among Washington, Ottawa and New Delhi. During his presidency, Mr. Biden has courted India’s leaders to counter the influence of Russia and China, despite growing concerns about India’s commitment to democracy. Mr. Modi, who has been in office since 2014, was re-elected as India’s prime minister in June, even as his Bharatiya Janata Party lost its majority in Parliament.",indian man pleaded guilty monday charge orchestrating failed assassination plot sikh separatist new york plan prosecutor say devised behalf unnamed official india government defendant nikhil gupta arrested czech republic year ago extradited last week make first appearance manhattan federal court accused trying arrange murder gurpatwant singh pannun american citizen lawyer new yorkbased sikh secessionist group murder attempt played backdrop doubt india commitment democracy spanned several country mirrored successful killing another separatist canada prosecutor say monday morning mr gupta entered lower manhattan courtroom blue cardigan yellow patterned shirt appeared relaxed spoke lawyer jeffrey chabrowe defense table held metropolitan detention center brooklyn since landing united state friday afternoon statement reporter arraignment mr chabrowe called case complex matter india united state background detail develop may cast government allegation entirely new light said mr gupta charged murder hire conspiracy commit murder hire convicted would face maximum year prison charge sent back detention center monday arraignment set appear court june statement monday attorney general merrick b garland said mr gupta face justice american courtroom extradition make clear justice department tolerate attempt silence harm american citizen said indictment unsealed november manhattan federal prosecutor described audacious plot began around may indian government employee enlisted mr gupta organize killing mr pannun living new york time mr pannun general counsel sikh justice organization support secession punjab state northern india vocal critic indian government banned country prosecutor say mr gupta lived india told government official involvement international narcotic weapon trafficking according indictment direction indian government employee mr gupta contacted man believed would help hire hit man new york fact agent american government agent introduced mr gupta undercover drug enforcement administration officer pretended hit man deal brokered mr gupta indian government official agreed pay dea officer kill mr pannun including cash advance job prosecutor said mr gupta shared personal information mr pannun undercover officer including mr pannuns address new york phone number indian official asked update mr gupta relayed surveillance photo mr pannun agent sent mr gupta instructed undercover officer carry assassination soon possible asked around time highlevel meeting u indian official according indictment prime minister narendra modi visited washington met president biden june prosecutor said june year gunman killed hardeep singh nijjar another sikh separatist leader british columbia canada mr nijjar knew mr pannun also outspoken critic indian government soon prosecutor said mr gupta told undercover officer mr nijjar also target many target mr gupta told officer pretend hit man need wait kill mr pannun prosecutor said monday mr pannun said statement full faith united state would hold mr gupta coconspirator accountable attempt life american soil blatant case india transnational terrorism challenging america sovereignty unequivocally prof modis india belief using violence suppress dissenting political opinion said spokesman indian embassy washington dc could immediately reached comment monday mr guptas case threatened complicate delicate relation among washington ottawa new delhi presidency mr biden courted india leader counter influence russia china despite growing concern india commitment democracy mr modi office since reelected india prime minister june even bharatiya janata party lost majority parliament
nytimes,Train Crash in India Leaves at Least 8 Dead and Dozens Injured,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/world/asia/india-train-crash.html,"A freight train collided with a passenger train in eastern India on Monday, killing at least eight people and injuring 50 others, officials said. The episode occurred at around 9 a.m. when the Kanchanjunga Express, which was carrying passengers to the state of West Bengal from the state of Tripura, was leaving the Rangapani station. Four coaches of the popular and often-crowded passenger train derailed when it was rammed from behind by the commercial train. Images from the accident site showed one of the passenger coaches lifted off the railway track and balancing on a coach of the freight train. The death toll was likely to rise. Local news outlets, citing police officials, reported at least 15 people dead. The driver and the assistant driver of the freight train and a guard on the passenger train were among those killed. Jaya Varma Sinha, the chairperson of India’s railway board, said rescue operations were completed. Ashwini Vaishnaw, India’s railway minister, was en route to the site. The relatively low number of casualties could be attributed to the fact that the rear portion of the Kanchanjunga Express, which took the biggest impact from the collision, comprised cargo coaches and the guard’s coach. Passengers were in compartments far forward from the impact. While an investigation has been ordered to look into the cause of the collision, Ms. Sinha said human error such as disregarding a railway signal could have caused the crash. The accident again brings to the fore the issue of rail safety in a country whose millions of poor residents rely on railways for transport. India’s rail network is one of the world’s largest and is crucial to the country’s economy and its people’s lives and livelihood. The country has, in recent years, invested heavily on rail safety after a long history of deadly accidents. Although the overall number of rail accidents has lessened over the past decade, incidents with mass casualties have persisted. Last June, 290 people were killed when two passenger trains collided after one of them struck a stationary freight train at full speed and derailed in the state of Odisha. After that incident, opposition leaders demanded the resignation of Mr. Vaishnaw, the railway minister. He has said he was trying to expand a safety system, called Kavach, that is meant to prevent accidents when two trains are moving on the same track. Ms. Sinha said the technology had not yet been deployed on the route of the Kanchanjunga Express.",freight train collided passenger train eastern india monday killing least eight people injuring others official said episode occurred around kanchanjunga express carrying passenger state west bengal state tripura leaving rangapani station four coach popular oftencrowded passenger train derailed rammed behind commercial train image accident site showed one passenger coach lifted railway track balancing coach freight train death toll likely rise local news outlet citing police official reported least people dead driver assistant driver freight train guard passenger train among killed jaya varma sinha chairperson india railway board said rescue operation completed ashwini vaishnaw india railway minister en route site relatively low number casualty could attributed fact rear portion kanchanjunga express took biggest impact collision comprised cargo coach guard coach passenger compartment far forward impact investigation ordered look cause collision m sinha said human error disregarding railway signal could caused crash accident brings fore issue rail safety country whose million poor resident rely railway transport india rail network one world largest crucial country economy people life livelihood country recent year invested heavily rail safety long history deadly accident although overall number rail accident lessened past decade incident mass casualty persisted last june people killed two passenger train collided one struck stationary freight train full speed derailed state odisha incident opposition leader demanded resignation mr vaishnaw railway minister said trying expand safety system called kavach meant prevent accident two train moving track m sinha said technology yet deployed route kanchanjunga express
nytimes,"G7 Leaders, Expanding the Circle, Shift Focus to Migration and the South","June 14, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/world/europe/g7-summit-ai-china-india.html,"The Group of 7 countries threw open the doors of their club on Friday to India, Brazil, Turkey and other non-Western countries, acknowledging a shifting global landscape as they tried to enlist these nations’ leaders in causes ranging from climate change to managing the economic competition with China. While diplomats from the Group of 7 hammered out a communiqué that pledged support for Ukraine in its war against Russia and greater ambition in curbing carbon emissions, the focus was on Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and other leaders from outside the G7, whose support is increasingly critical to achieving any of these goals. Among the thorny questions on the second day of the summit: migration, which has helped fuel a recent resurgence of populism and far-right parties in Europe and the United States. The leaders also discussed the war in Gaza and China’s state subsidies of industries like electric vehicles, which has prompted the United States and the European Union to impose tariffs on Chinese exports. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, who is hosting the gathering, said the goal of her expanded guest list was to “strengthen dialogue with the nations of the Global South.” She insisted that the Group of 7 was “not a fortress closed in itself” but “an offer of values that we open to the world.” Ms. Meloni recruited Pope Francis to speak to the leaders about the dangers posed by artificial intelligence. Francis urged them to regulate the technology, of which he was himself a victim when A.I.-generated fake images of him clad in a white puffer jacket and a jewel-encrusted crucifix went viral last year. “The benefits and the damages it causes will depend on the way it is used,” the pope declared, warning of the risks of A.I.’s uncontrolled development. He called for lethal autonomous weapons, which are unmanned and uncontrolled by a human hand, to be banned, saying, “No machine should ever decide whether to take the life of a human being away.” The pope’s appearance was the emotional highlight of a day of carefully staged summitry that seemed to concede that the West is less dominant demographically and economically than in the past — and that it is listening to calls for more equity and balance in global decision-making. As Ms. Meloni guided the pope, in a wheelchair, around a circular table to meet the leaders, he was greeted by a visibly moved President Biden and got an enthusiastic hug from Argentina’s flamboyant president, Javier Milei, whose election last November was viewed as another sign of the rising tide of populism across the Americas and Europe. This is not the first time non-Western leaders have been invited to a Group of 7 meeting, but rarely have they been so conspicuous. In part that reflects the issues that Ms. Meloni has highlighted: Africa and the Mediterranean. The leaders of Algeria, Kenya and Tunisia were on hand at a luxury resort hotel on Italy’s southern coast, as was President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. “Inviting key developing country leaders reflects the reality that confronting China and Russia requires the cooperation of more than the G7,” said Daniel M. Price, who was a top trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “And Brazil, India and Turkey are as concerned about Chinese predatory trade practices and overcapacity as are Japan, Europe and the U.S.” The final G7 communiqué voiced concern about what the leaders called China’s “persistent industrial targeting and comprehensive nonmarket policies and practices that are leading to global spillovers, market distortions and harmful overcapacity.” The communiqué endorsed Mr. Biden’s effort to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. France and Canada had pushed for stronger language on Israel’s conduct of the war, according to people familiar with the negotiations, but the United States and Germany resisted. In a victory for Ms. Meloni, a conservative who opposes abortion, the communiqué did not include an explicit reference to abortion, in a passage that pledged to promote “comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.” A communiqué released by the Group of 7 leaders after their last summit in Hiroshima, Japan, referred specifically to abortion rights. The issue injected a briefly discordant note into the gathering after President Emmanuel Macron of France told an Italian journalist that some politicians did not share France’s “vision of equality between women and men.” Ms. Meloni criticized Mr. Macron, who recently called a snap parliamentary election, as seeking to politicize the issue at a “precious forum like the G7.” For the most part, however, the meeting underscored harmony among the leaders, many of whom are embattled by their own domestic politics. It also served as a platform for Ms. Meloni, 47, who has overcome initial qualms about her political roots in a party built on the ashes of fascism to win respect for her steadfast support of Ukraine. Presiding over the two days of meetings, she was able to put a spotlight on several of her pet issues. How to control migration has vexed the United States and Europe, compounded by the effects of climate change and warfare in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Ukraine. It is a particularly delicate issue for Ms. Meloni, who has campaigned hard to fight what she has called “uncontrolled immigration” to Italy and other parts of Europe from Africa and the Middle East. While Europe has welcomed thousands of Ukrainians, especially women and children, fleeing the Russian invasion, Ukrainian officials have urged European countries to help them repatriate men of fighting age. “Turkey is a critical player on global migration,” said Peter Westmacott, who served as Britain’s ambassador to Turkey, France and the United States. He noted that there are about three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds and Afghans. “If Europe wants to control migration from these countries,” Mr. Westmacott said, “Turkey is an indispensable partner.” Mr. Erdogan, he said, could also yet play a role in brokering an end to Ukraine’s war with Russia. As a Black Sea power, Turkey has kept open its commercial and political links to Russia. But it is also a NATO member and has supplied cheap, highly effective drones to help the Ukrainian resistance. Some of the invitations reflected diplomatic protocol, according to Italian officials. Brazil, India and South Africa were automatically included as current or future presidents of the Group of 20 industrialized nations. Argentina was invited, these officials said, because Mr. Milei has recognized the connections and interdependence between East and West. He and Ms. Meloni have also cultivated close personal ties, sharing a right-wing populism that includes opposition to abortion and gay rights.",group country threw open door club friday india brazil turkey nonwestern country acknowledging shifting global landscape tried enlist nation leader cause ranging climate change managing economic competition china diplomat group hammered communiqu pledged support ukraine war russia greater ambition curbing carbon emission focus prime minister narendra modi india president luiz incio lula da silva brazil leader outside g whose support increasingly critical achieving goal among thorny question second day summit migration helped fuel recent resurgence populism farright party europe united state leader also discussed war gaza china state subsidy industry like electric vehicle prompted united state european union impose tariff chinese export prime minister giorgia meloni italy hosting gathering said goal expanded guest list strengthen dialogue nation global south insisted group fortress closed offer value open world m meloni recruited pope francis speak leader danger posed artificial intelligence francis urged regulate technology victim aigenerated fake image clad white puffer jacket jewelencrusted crucifix went viral last year benefit damage cause depend way used pope declared warning risk ai uncontrolled development called lethal autonomous weapon unmanned uncontrolled human hand banned saying machine ever decide whether take life human away pope appearance emotional highlight day carefully staged summitry seemed concede west le dominant demographically economically past listening call equity balance global decisionmaking m meloni guided pope wheelchair around circular table meet leader greeted visibly moved president biden got enthusiastic hug argentina flamboyant president javier milei whose election last november viewed another sign rising tide populism across america europe first time nonwestern leader invited group meeting rarely conspicuous part reflects issue m meloni highlighted africa mediterranean leader algeria kenya tunisia hand luxury resort hotel italy southern coast president recep tayyip erdogan turkey inviting key developing country leader reflects reality confronting china russia requires cooperation g said daniel price top trade adviser president george w bush brazil india turkey concerned chinese predatory trade practice overcapacity japan europe u final g communiqu voiced concern leader called china persistent industrial targeting comprehensive nonmarket policy practice leading global spillover market distortion harmful overcapacity communiqu endorsed mr bidens effort broker ceasefire israel hamas gaza france canada pushed stronger language israel conduct war according people familiar negotiation united state germany resisted victory m meloni conservative opposes abortion communiqu include explicit reference abortion passage pledged promote comprehensive sexual reproductive health right communiqu released group leader last summit hiroshima japan referred specifically abortion right issue injected briefly discordant note gathering president emmanuel macron france told italian journalist politician share france vision equality woman men m meloni criticized mr macron recently called snap parliamentary election seeking politicize issue precious forum like g part however meeting underscored harmony among leader many embattled domestic politics also served platform m meloni overcome initial qualm political root party built ash fascism win respect steadfast support ukraine presiding two day meeting able put spotlight several pet issue control migration vexed united state europe compounded effect climate change warfare afghanistan middle east ukraine particularly delicate issue m meloni campaigned hard fight called uncontrolled immigration italy part europe africa middle east europe welcomed thousand ukrainian especially woman child fleeing russian invasion ukrainian official urged european country help repatriate men fighting age turkey critical player global migration said peter westmacott served britain ambassador turkey france united state noted three million syrian refugee turkey well hundred thousand iraqi kurd afghan europe want control migration country mr westmacott said turkey indispensable partner mr erdogan said could also yet play role brokering end ukraine war russia black sea power turkey kept open commercial political link russia also nato member supplied cheap highly effective drone help ukrainian resistance invitation reflected diplomatic protocol according italian official brazil india south africa automatically included current future president group industrialized nation argentina invited official said mr milei recognized connection interdependence east west m meloni also cultivated close personal tie sharing rightwing populism includes opposition abortion gay right
nytimes,Fire in Kuwait Worker Housing Leaves at Least 49 Dead,"June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/world/middleeast/fire-kuwait-migrant-worker-housing.html,"At least 49 people were killed and dozens of others injured in the Persian Gulf country of Kuwait, the state news agency said, when a fire broke out on Wednesday in a building that housed scores of low-income workers, many of them Indian nationals. The fire began during the morning in a coastal area called Mangaf, about half an hour’s drive from the center of the capital, Kuwait City. The Kuwaiti authorities have held the building owner for questioning as they investigate the cause of the fire and try to determine whether “any shortcoming or neglect” played a role, the state news agency reported. The authorities promised to begin a campaign to tackle building code violations. The public prosecutor’s office also planned to inspect the site and interview survivors. Speaking to journalists at the site of the fire, Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Al Sabah — Kuwait’s deputy prime minister and interior minister — blamed “the greed of property owners” for the disaster and said that the owner of the company employing the workers would also be detained, the Reuters news agency and Kuwaiti newspapers reported. Jayashankar, an Indian salesman who survived the fire, said that he awoke to screams around 4 a.m. local time. He and his roommates opened the door to their fourth-floor apartment and found that thick black smoke had enveloped the corridor, burning their lungs, he said in a phone interview, asking to be identified by his first name only for fear of retribution. Instead of trying to escape, he said, they locked the door, opened a window and waited for help. Two of his roommates who left the apartment to find an exit later died, he said. Witnesses told local news outlets that the fire had begun at the bottom of the seven-story building, sending smoke billowing upward. In a televised interview, an official in Kuwait’s firefighting force, Col. Sayed Hassan Al-Moussawi, said, “In a building like this, you’re supposed to go up to the roof, but unfortunately the door to the roof was locked.” Ramesh, an Indian worker who lives in a building next door and who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said in an interview that he saw people trying to jump out of windows to escape. The fire’s high death toll highlighted the perils faced by low-income immigrants to Gulf countries, who often toil under exploitative contracts and live in overcrowded housing, with regulatory protections that are limited or poorly enforced. Foreigners make up about two-thirds of the population of Kuwait, an oil-rich nation with one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds. Many are low-paid workers from South Asian countries who perform jobs including construction, restaurant service and street cleaning. More than 50 people hurt during the fire were sent to hospitals around Kuwait, with injuries including burns, broken bones from jumping out of the building and carbon monoxide poisoning from smoke inhalation, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. Nine were in critical condition, it said. Many of the workers affected were from India, the country’s embassy in Kuwait said on social media. On Wednesday, India’s ambassador to Kuwait, Adarsh Swaika, visited several hospitals where workers were taken, the embassy said in its posts. In a post on X, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India said that the fire was “saddening” and that the Indian Embassy would monitor the situation closely and work with the authorities “to assist the affected.” In a video published by the Kuwaiti news media, Sheikh Fahad was shown at the location of the fire, questioning an unidentified man about who lived in the building. The man told him that 196 people had lived there. The video cut off after Sheikh Fahad told the authorities to detain the man for questioning. Officials working in the municipality overseeing the area were also suspended from work pending an investigation, Kuwait’s state news agency reported. Building codes in Gulf countries are often laxly put in place, and smoke detectors and fire escapes are not common in residential properties. At the site of the fire on Wednesday afternoon, municipal employees were already putting up notices of violations on nearby buildings, including for partitioning rooms with gypsum board. Mangaf is predominantly inhabited by migrant workers, with apartment blocks housing men from India, Bangladesh and Egypt. Interviewed by The New York Times near the fire location, workers who lived nearby gave varying accounts of the numbers of men typically housed in each room, ranging from three to 12. Jayashankar, the survivor, said that nine people, all Indians, had shared his three-bedroom apartment. The building bore a sign saying it was a workers’ camp for a company called NBTC Group, a contracting firm headquartered in Kuwait with business in construction, industry, logistics and related fields. Phone calls to the company on Wednesday went unanswered, and an employee at the company’s offices said that staff members had been detained by officials that day. Another Indian worker who lived on the second floor of the building said that he and his roommates had survived because they had been out working an overnight shift. The worker, Sami, 45, who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said he had not yet been able to go inside to retrieve his belongings and inspect the damage because the police had closed off entrances to the building. Shahrukh Kha, who is from Bihar, India, said that he had spent all day trying to reach his brother, Kalu, who lived in the building, but that his brother’s phone was off. “We have not gotten any kind of information about whether he is injured or dead,” he said in a phone interview. Kalu Kha, a 30-year-old salesman who works in a fruit and vegetable shop, had been planning to travel home to India next month, his brother said; his wedding date is set for July 22.",least people killed dozen others injured persian gulf country kuwait state news agency said fire broke wednesday building housed score lowincome worker many indian national fire began morning coastal area called mangaf half hour drive center capital kuwait city kuwaiti authority held building owner questioning investigate cause fire try determine whether shortcoming neglect played role state news agency reported authority promised begin campaign tackle building code violation public prosecutor office also planned inspect site interview survivor speaking journalist site fire sheikh fahad yusuf al sabah kuwait deputy prime minister interior minister blamed greed property owner disaster said owner company employing worker would also detained reuters news agency kuwaiti newspaper reported jayashankar indian salesman survived fire said awoke scream around local time roommate opened door fourthfloor apartment found thick black smoke enveloped corridor burning lung said phone interview asking identified first name fear retribution instead trying escape said locked door opened window waited help two roommate left apartment find exit later died said witness told local news outlet fire begun bottom sevenstory building sending smoke billowing upward televised interview official kuwait firefighting force col sayed hassan almoussawi said building like youre supposed go roof unfortunately door roof locked ramesh indian worker life building next door also asked identified first name fear retribution said interview saw people trying jump window escape fire high death toll highlighted peril faced lowincome immigrant gulf country often toil exploitative contract live overcrowded housing regulatory protection limited poorly enforced foreigner make twothirds population kuwait oilrich nation one world largest sovereign wealth fund many lowpaid worker south asian country perform job including construction restaurant service street cleaning people hurt fire sent hospital around kuwait injury including burn broken bone jumping building carbon monoxide poisoning smoke inhalation ministry health said statement nine critical condition said many worker affected india country embassy kuwait said social medium wednesday india ambassador kuwait adarsh swaika visited several hospital worker taken embassy said post post x prime minister narendra modi india said fire saddening indian embassy would monitor situation closely work authority assist affected video published kuwaiti news medium sheikh fahad shown location fire questioning unidentified man lived building man told people lived video cut sheikh fahad told authority detain man questioning official working municipality overseeing area also suspended work pending investigation kuwait state news agency reported building code gulf country often laxly put place smoke detector fire escape common residential property site fire wednesday afternoon municipal employee already putting notice violation nearby building including partitioning room gypsum board mangaf predominantly inhabited migrant worker apartment block housing men india bangladesh egypt interviewed new york time near fire location worker lived nearby gave varying account number men typically housed room ranging three jayashankar survivor said nine people indian shared threebedroom apartment building bore sign saying worker camp company called nbtc group contracting firm headquartered kuwait business construction industry logistics related field phone call company wednesday went unanswered employee company office said staff member detained official day another indian worker lived second floor building said roommate survived working overnight shift worker sami also asked identified first name fear retribution said yet able go inside retrieve belonging inspect damage police closed entrance building shahrukh kha bihar india said spent day trying reach brother kalu lived building brother phone gotten kind information whether injured dead said phone interview kalu kha yearold salesman work fruit vegetable shop planning travel home india next month brother said wedding date set july
nytimes,"At the Ambani Wedding Celebrations, a Dazzling Display of Jewels","June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/fashion/weddings/ambani-jewels.html,"When Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India abruptly changed her country’s constitution in 1971 and abolished the Privy Purse, a government allowance for the country’s former princely rulers, she also moved to nationalize their storied treasuries. Among the maharajahs, nizams and nabobs that once ruled the subcontinent, this set off a frenzy as they scurried to bury the family jewels. For centuries, the rarity, scale and grandeur of Indian jewels was so great that many became iconic objects. Take the Patiala Necklace, a tiered ornament resembling draperies of gems. Designed by Cartier, it featured an astounding 2,930 diamonds and centered on a single rock the size of a walnut. Or consider the Indore Pears, two stupendous and closely matched diamonds owned by Maharajah Yeshwant Rao Holkar II, a glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom was in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Indian princely patronage long set a global standard of splendor for both artistry and ostentation in the jewel trade. Yet in the decades after the Privy Purse, most of the big rocks seemed to have vanished underground. Legend has it that members of formerly royal families stashed their jewels in Swiss vaults, pawned them on the black market or hid them in flower pots. Bling on a royal scale largely disappeared. Or so it seemed until a fresh cadre of princes heaved into view: oligarchs. The richest of these by orders of magnitude is Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of his family’s megacompany Reliance Industries. Mr. Ambani’s personal fortune is estimated by Forbes at a staggering $115 billion. Despite his vast wealth, few outside India had heard of him — that is, until March 1, when he hosted a three-day party to celebrate his son Anant’s wedding in July. Everything about the prewedding affair was on a princely scale: the guest list of 1,000, including boldface names like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump; a glass palace specially constructed in the Ambani’s hometown, Jamnagar, in the western state of Gujarat; and Rihanna’s first public performance in years. Rihanna’s reported $6 million payday hogged the headlines, but what lit up at least one obsessive corner of the internet was the Ambani jewelry. This included necklaces and earrings and rings and hair ornaments of a size and grandeur seldom seen publicly since the days of the Raj. “It was almost like the time of maharajahs 100 years down the line,” said Pramod Kumar, an archivist and a founder of the museum consultancy EKA. He is also keeper of topophilia.india, an erudite Instagram account that is catnip for Indophile aesthetes. Mr. Kumar’s sleuth work traced a possible source of the two most gobsmacking gems seen at the Ambani prewedding celebration: massive step-cut Colombian emeralds roughly the size of Popsicles. Draped one below the other as pendants to a diamond necklace, they were worn one evening by the bridegroom’s mother, Nita Ambani. The bigger one was “of 562 carats,” Mr. Kumar wrote in an Instagram post, adding that the weight of the smaller stone was a mere 303 carats. Whatever their source, those emeralds were just two among many gems on display throughout an event at which the jewels often had greater star power than their wearers. “That emerald necklace was what caught everyone’s attention at first, but it was all almost unfathomable,” said Stellene Volandes, the editor in chief of Town & Country. She noted the scarcity represented by ropes of the rarest natural pearls from the Arabian Sea; necklaces in the heavy, ornate rani haar style studded with diamonds; and headpieces known as maang tikka, made with deep green emeralds from the storied Muzo mines. “You’d be very hard-pressed to find comparables for the sheer size and horsepower” of the jewels at the Ambani prewedding party, said Nico Landrigan, the president of the Verdura jewelry house in New York. “The Indians are a jewelry-obsessed culture in a category all their own. So you can only imagine what the actual wedding will bring out.” Before the wedding, scheduled for July 12 to 14 in Mumbai, there was yet another lavish preparatory celebration and opportunity to flaunt big rocks — a cruise from the Tyrrhenian Sea in Palermo, Italy, to the Mediterranean in Cannes, France, on an ocean liner whose 2,400 staterooms had been retrofitted for the Ambanis as three-bedroom suites for 800 invited guests. “Basically, what the Ambanis are doing is displaying a kind of old-style Hollywood glam,” said Mr. Kumar of EKA. “You don’t see that with any other current billionaire moguls in Europe or America, at least not in the public realm.” For Daniela Mascetti, the former chairwoman of Sotheby’s jewelry division in Europe and an author of “Understanding Jewelry,” a bible of the trade, the group more aptly compared to the Ambanis is the robber barons of the Industrial Age. “You have to look back to Vanderbilt or Gould, who also wanted big door-stoppers,” Ms. Mascetti said from London. “Let’s put it in a nice way,” she added. “If you are new money and you want to display wealth, you go big.” Yet it is not altogether that simple. Certain Ambani jewels were crafted using the whopper stones, but that is not to suggest that the determining factor in commissioning them was size. “There is tremendous artistry in the work,” said Ms. Volandes of Town & Country. Much of the Ambani jewels were designed by Viren Bhagat, among the more refined high jewelers, though also an assiduously private one. More than the size of individual stones like the stepped-cut emeralds, few save a detective like Mr. Kumar could predict their origins. “Being one-off is of the greatest importance in that world,” Francesca Amfitheatrof, the creative director of high jewelry and watches at Louis Vuitton, said recently from St.-Tropez, France, where she was debuting her latest collection. “To be able to source things that are so unique and outstanding, honestly, only an emperor has that possibility anymore,” she said. “It’s completely maharajah-like. It’s imperial.”",prime minister indira gandhi india abruptly changed country constitution abolished privy purse government allowance country former princely ruler also moved nationalize storied treasury among maharajah nizams nabob ruled subcontinent set frenzy scurried bury family jewel century rarity scale grandeur indian jewel great many became iconic object take patiala necklace tiered ornament resembling drapery gem designed cartier featured astounding diamond centered single rock size walnut consider indore pear two stupendous closely matched diamond owned maharajah yeshwant rao holkar ii glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom central indian state madhya pradesh indian princely patronage long set global standard splendor artistry ostentation jewel trade yet decade privy purse big rock seemed vanished underground legend member formerly royal family stashed jewel swiss vault pawned black market hid flower pot bling royal scale largely disappeared seemed fresh cadre prince heaved view oligarch richest order magnitude mukesh ambani chairman family megacompany reliance industry mr ambanis personal fortune estimated forbes staggering billion despite vast wealth outside india heard march hosted threeday party celebrate son anants wedding july everything prewedding affair princely scale guest list including boldface name like mark zuckerberg bill gate ivanka trump glass palace specially constructed ambanis hometown jamnagar western state gujarat rihannas first public performance year rihannas reported million payday hogged headline lit least one obsessive corner internet ambani jewelry included necklace earring ring hair ornament size grandeur seldom seen publicly since day raj almost like time maharajah year line said pramod kumar archivist founder museum consultancy eka also keeper topophiliaindia erudite instagram account catnip indophile aesthete mr kumars sleuth work traced possible source two gobsmacking gem seen ambani prewedding celebration massive stepcut colombian emerald roughly size popsicle draped one pendant diamond necklace worn one evening bridegroom mother nita ambani bigger one carat mr kumar wrote instagram post adding weight smaller stone mere carat whatever source emerald two among many gem display throughout event jewel often greater star power wearer emerald necklace caught everyones attention first almost unfathomable said stellene volandes editor chief town country noted scarcity represented rope rarest natural pearl arabian sea necklace heavy ornate rani haar style studded diamond headpiece known maang tikka made deep green emerald storied muzo mine youd hardpressed find comparables sheer size horsepower jewel ambani prewedding party said nico landrigan president verdura jewelry house new york indian jewelryobsessed culture category imagine actual wedding bring wedding scheduled july mumbai yet another lavish preparatory celebration opportunity flaunt big rock cruise tyrrhenian sea palermo italy mediterranean cannes france ocean liner whose stateroom retrofitted ambanis threebedroom suite invited guest basically ambanis displaying kind oldstyle hollywood glam said mr kumar eka dont see current billionaire mogul europe america least public realm daniela mascetti former chairwoman sothebys jewelry division europe author understanding jewelry bible trade group aptly compared ambanis robber baron industrial age look back vanderbilt gould also wanted big doorstopper m mascetti said london let put nice way added new money want display wealth go big yet altogether simple certain ambani jewel crafted using whopper stone suggest determining factor commissioning size tremendous artistry work said m volandes town country much ambani jewel designed viren bhagat among refined high jeweler though also assiduously private one size individual stone like steppedcut emerald save detective like mr kumar could predict origin oneoff greatest importance world francesca amfitheatrof creative director high jewelry watch louis vuitton said recently sttropez france debuting latest collection able source thing unique outstanding honestly emperor possibility anymore said completely maharajahlike imperial

nytimes,"India-Pakistan Cricket World Cup Match Brings 34,000 Fans to Long Island","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/nyregion/india-pakistan-cricket-world-cup.html,"Normally at this time of year, the grassy southeastern corner of Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, N.Y., is a place for softball games, family picnics and a few cricket players enjoying a warm weekend afternoon. On Sunday, that space was transformed into a stage for one of the most-watched global sporting events of the year. More than 34,000 fans and cricket dignitaries squeezed into a temporary stadium built in the last three months in the Long Island park to watch the most anticipated match of the T20 Cricket World Cup: India versus Pakistan. For about three hours, fans in blue and orange India shirts mingled with their (vastly outnumbered) rivals in the dark green of Pakistan, producing a festive and vibrant atmosphere. They roared at every big play, shouting and waving signs and flags. They ate South Asian food sold at the concession stands, jumped, chanted, high-fived with fellow supporters and — after a bit of rain — soaked up the sunshine on a historic day at the usually quiet park. “It was electric,” said Chandu Talla, an India fan and entrepreneur from Tampa, Fla., who came to the match with his son Aryan, a high school junior. “We paid $2,500 per ticket and no regrets,” he added. “It was a dream come true to see India here.” After a slow start, India came back strong to win, and when Pakistan’s Naseem Shah hit the last ball from India bowler Arshdeep Singh, the India fans erupted in cheers. “It was pretty good,” said India bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who was named the player of the match. “Always, when India and Pakistan play, a lot of emotion does come in. It did feel like we had a lot of support.” People in the New York area may have been mostly oblivious to it, but any match between India and Pakistan, two of the greatest cricketing nations, is a monumental event, at least in South Asia and other cricket-loving parts of the world. The previous time the teams played, last fall, viewership reached 398 million in India alone, according to the International Cricket Council. (This year’s Super Bowl had 123 million viewers.) Sunday’s attendance (34,028) constituted the largest at an international cricket match in the United States, according to the I.C.C. Attendees included such cricketing legends as Yuvraj Singh of India, Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi and Australia’s Ricky Ponting. For Omar Minaya, the Yankees’ special adviser and the former general manager of the Mets, the cricket match was his first. “It’s amazing,” he said. “The atmosphere is great. It’s like the World Baseball Classic, or the Dominican Baseball League.” The T20 World Cup, held every two years, is a 20-nation tournament featuring a shorter form of cricket. This year, for the first time, the event is being held in the United States and several Caribbean nations where cricket is revered. The U.S. matches are also being held in Dallas and Lauderhill, Fla., but New York was designated for the marquee matchup. Cricket is part of the cultural fabric in both India and Pakistan, but political tensions over the decades have forced the countries to play each other in other places. “Oh, it’s contentious, a real battle of sentiments,” said Narinder Kapoor, 84, a retired U.S. Treasury Department agent, originally from New Delhi. “When these countries play, it’s a real hot potato.” A former amateur cricket player who emigrated to Syosset, N.Y., in 1972, Mr. Kapoor had not seen a cricket match live since 1974, although he watches the sport constantly on TV. He went to the game between Ireland and Canada on Friday and had hoped to attend Sunday’s big encounter, but his knees were ailing him, so he stayed home, according to his son, Sandeep Kapoor. The elder Mr. Kapoor said that he enjoyed the sparsely attended match on Friday, but added that the temporary stadium did not have enough accommodations for people with disabilities and that it was difficult for older people to ascend the steps. “But once you are inside, the field and the view is excellent,” he said. “World class.” Security was tight for the match, especially after a website purportedly affiliated with the terrorist organization ISIS called for attacks on the event. Mounted police, SWAT units, sniffer dogs, helicopters and large numbers of police officers swarmed the area, and long lines formed at entrances as people went through security scanners. Bruce Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, said that the I.C.C. had defrayed some of the cost of the security, which he said included local, state and federal agencies, including the F.B.I. “I want to commend the fans,” Mr. Blakeman said, adding, “Everybody has been so polite and respectful, and they followed instructions so they could be safe and healthy.” There was at least one exception. An airplane trailing a sign that said “Release Imran Khan” breached restricted airspace over the stadium before the match. (Mr. Khan, a former Pakistani cricket star and former prime minister of Pakistan, is serving a prison sentence there.) Mr. Blakeman said the plane was eventually intercepted. The mood at the park was generally upbeat, even for Pakistan fans on the losing end. “India-Pakistan is a very big deal,” said Temu Martin, an airfreight transport official from New Jersey and a Pakistan supporter. “But it’s not war. It’s a game.” He said that after Pakistan lost to the United States last week in a major upset in Dallas, ticket prices for Sunday’s match in East Meadow plummeted from over $2,000 to $600. He said he was planning to travel to Barbados for Pakistan’s next match and then to attend a knockout-stage match in Antigua. There are three more matches scheduled in New York, with the final one on Wednesday between India and the United States. The stadium will then be dismantled and the pieces sent out to other sporting events around the country.

nytimes,"Modi, Striking a Modest Tone, Is Sworn In for a Third Term","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/world/asia/india-changed-modi-swearing-in.html,"As a humbled Narendra Modi was sworn in on Sunday for a third term as India’s prime minister, the political air in New Delhi appeared transformed. The election that ended last week stripped Mr. Modi of his parliamentary majority and forced him to turn to a diverse set of coalition partners to stay in power. Now, these other parties are enjoying something that for years was singularly Mr. Modi’s: relevance and the spotlight. Their leaders have been swarmed by TV crews while on their way to present demands and policy opinions to Mr. Modi. His opponents, too, have been getting more airtime, with stations cutting live to their news conferences, something almost unheard-of in recent years. Above all, the change can be seen in Mr. Modi himself. For now, at least, the messianic air is gone. He pitches himself as the modest administrator that voters showed they wanted. “To run the government, a majority is necessary. But to run the nation, a consensus is necessary,” Mr. Modi said in a speech on Friday to members of his coalition ahead of his swearing in. “The people want us to deliver better than before.” A visibly emotional Mr. Modi took the oath of office on Sunday evening, only the second prime minister to be elected for a third consecutive term in the seven decades of India’s republic. The ceremony, at the country’s presidential palace, was attended by about 8,000 supporters and dignitaries, including the leaders of India’s neighboring nations. To many, Mr. Modi’s shift in approach can mean only good things for the country’s democracy — a move toward moderation in a hugely diverse nation that was being whipped into a Hindu-first monolith in the image of one man. The question is whether Mr. Modi can truly become something he has not been during his two-plus decades in elected office: a consensus builder. “He is a pragmatic politician and, for his own survival and for the survival of his party, he will be a little mellowed,” said Ashutosh, a New Delhi-based analyst who uses only one name and is the author of a book on how Indian politics have changed under Mr. Modi. “But to assume a qualitative change in his style of governance is expecting too much.” A trademark of Mr. Modi’s leadership in recent years has been the use of power levers at his disposal — from pressure of police cases to the lure of a share in power and its perks — to break his opponents and get them to switch to his side. A bruised governing party may well try such tactics to peel away some lawmakers to his side, analyst say, to buttress his place at the top. But in the days leading up to the swearing-in, a change in approach was evident. When members of the new coalition packed into the hall of India’s old Parliament building on Friday for deliberations on forming the government, every time a senior ally seated next to him stood up to start his speech, Mr. Modi also stood up. When it was time for Mr. Modi to be garlanded as the coalition’s choice for prime minister, he waited for the leaders of the two main coalition partners to arrive by his side before the congratulatory wreath of purple orchids was placed around his neck. His hourlong address contained none of his usual references to himself in the third person. His tone was measured. He focused on the coalition’s promise of “good governance” and “the dream of a developed India,” and he acknowledged that things would be different from the past 10 years. The last time Mr. Modi came to the Parliament complex for a closely watched event, last May when he inaugurated a new, more modern building for the assembly, he made an entrance some observers compared with that of a king: with markings on his forehead as a sign of piety and a scepter in his hand, as shirtless, chanting Hindu monks walked ahead of and behind him. This time, he went straight to a copy of the Constitution, which declares that India is a secular and socialist democracy, bowing before it and lifting it to his forehead. For the first time in his more than two decades in elected office, Mr. Modi finds himself in uncharted territory. Until now, as long as he has been at the helm — whether at the state level as the chief minister of Gujarat or at the national level — his Bharatiya Janata Party has always had a majority. Analysts say that history of never having been in the opposition has shaped his heavy-handed approach to politics. When he left Gujarat, after 13 years, he had established such a firm grip and had so routed the opposition that the state had effectively become one of single-party rule. His first national victory in 2014, with a majority for his B.J.P., ended decades of coalition governance in India, in which no party had been able to capture the 272 seats in Parliament necessary for a majority. In 2019, he was re-elected with an even bigger majority. Mr. Modi’s enormous power helped swiftly carry out what had for decades been his right-wing party’s agenda, including construction of a lavish Hindu temple on a long-disputed site that once held a mosque, and the revocation of the special status long enjoyed by the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir. A separatist insurgency has long troubled the Himalayan Kashmir region. As the inauguration ceremony began in New Delhi on Sunday, a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims in the Reasi district fell into a gorge after gunmen opened fire on it. At least eight people were killed, the police said. A trademark of Mr. Modi’s governance was a disregard for parliamentary procedures and for debates on legislation. His unexpected, overnight demonetization in 2016 — which invalidated India’s currency in an effort to crack down on corruption — threw the country into chaos and dealt a blow to a still cash-driven economy. Similarly, rushing to enact laws aimed at overhauling the agriculture market resulted in a year of protests that choked Delhi, forcing Mr. Modi to retreat. Before the election results came out, Mr. Modi’s party had predicted that his coalition would win 400 seats in India’s 543-seat Parliament. The opposition would be reduced to sitting “in the spectators’ gallery,” Mr. Modi said. Officials in his government had made clear that in his new term he would seek to put in place the only main item remaining on his party’s agenda: legislating a “uniform civil code” across this diverse country to replace varying laws of different religions that currently govern issues like marriage and inheritance. His party leaders spoke of Mr. Modi not only as their leader for the current term, but also for the next election in 2029, when he would be 78. “He has been trying to transform the country,” Sudesh Verma, a B.J.P. official who wrote a book on Mr. Modi’s rise, said in an interview before the election results were announced. “I look forward to him working like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, who worked into his 90s.” But under a coalition government, Mr. Modi’s traditional approach will be difficult. Two of the main coalition parties that helped him achieve the minimum number of Parliament seats to form a government are secular, in contrast to Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist ideology. N. Chandrababu Naidu, whose party holds 16 seats, has been scathing in the past in his criticism of Mr. Modi’s treatment of the Muslim minority. He has also openly criticized Mr. Modi for using the central investigating agencies to target his opponents and taking “steps to subvert all democratic institutions.” Neerja Chowdhury, a political analyst in Delhi and the author of the 2023 book “How Prime Ministers Decide,” said, “The contentious ideological issues, like the enactment of the uniform civil code, may be put on the back burner if the allies are not comfortable with it.” Mr. Modi’s popular image is built on two strong pillars. He is a champion of economic development, with an inspiring biography of a rise from a humble caste and relative poverty. He is also a lifelong Hindu nationalist, with decades as a foot soldier in a movement seeking to turn India’s secular and diverse state into an overtly Hindu-first place. At the peak of his power, the Hindu nationalist aspect increasingly dominated. Analysts say that the recent rebuke by voters might be a lucky break for the nation: prompting Mr. Modi to tap into his development champion side, and to focus on a legacy of economic transformation that could improve the lives of all Indians.",humbled narendra modi sworn sunday third term india prime minister political air new delhi appeared transformed election ended last week stripped mr modi

nytimes,"India’s Modi, Humbled by Voters, Faces Potent Economic Struggles","June 7, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/business/india-election-modi-economy.html,"Before the Indian election results emerged this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was widely viewed as a charismatic and popular strongman celebrated by the business world for elevating its importance, even as he failed to solve a vexing problem: how to turn swift economic growth into critically needed jobs. After the election, Mr. Modi finds himself staring at that same monumental puzzle, yet relegated to an uncomfortable new status. He is the head of a party that has been chastened at the polls, forcing him to forge a coalition to maintain power. Mr. Modi’s governing authority is likely to be constrained by the complexities of keeping his coalition partners on his side. He could not solve India’s most deep-seated economic challenge when he wielded a monopolistic hold on power. Now, he is a weakened leader who must balance additional interests, while still lacking an obvious way to improve living standards. “There has been a sense that employment growth has been weak in the last four, five years,” said Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic adviser to the Modi administration, who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “How do you create more jobs? This is really India’s central economic challenge, but I think the government will find itself with relatively limited tools.” The humbling of Mr. Modi’s party resonates in part as an expression of popular frustration that India remains a land of economic peril for hundreds of millions of people, as well as a country defined by astonishing contrasts in wealth. In major cities, five-star hotels boasting sumptuous spas look down on teeming slums that lack plumbing. In rural areas, malnutrition prevails under many roofs, and families struggle to find the money to keep children in school. Though its working-age population numbers roughly one billion, India has only 430 million jobs, according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, an independent research institution in Mumbai. And most of those counted as employed are stuck in precarious circumstances as day laborers and farm hands, lacking reliable wages and government workplace protections. Improved livelihoods are evident in many cities, from the high-rise apartments filling out the horizons to air-conditioned shopping malls and luxury cars choking roads. But the gains are narrowly concentrated. Professionals who work in technology centers in the south of the country and around the capital of New Delhi have enjoyed substantial progress. A rapidly growing domestic auto industry is a source of relatively high-paying jobs. Magnates like Gautam Adani, one of Asia’s richest men, have seen their business empires enhanced by their relationships with Mr. Modi and his willingness to eviscerate regulatory impediments to their greater fortune. But most Indian workers are effectively marooned in the so-called informal sector — laboring at roadside stalls, in small shops and in itinerant trades where they have no guarantee of income or the possibility of advancement. The failure of economic growth to yield more jobs is in large part the story of how India missed out on the manufacturing boom that played out in East Asia over recent decades. From South Korea and China to Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, hundreds of millions of people have escaped poverty via wages earned in factories. India has not shared in that transformation in large part because of a historical focus on self-sufficiency, a disdain for international trade and stultifying bureaucracy that has discouraged investment. “The whole manufacturing thing bypassed India,” Mr. Subramanian, the economist, said. “It’s that bigger development failure that is continuing to haunt India.” Mr. Modi has pursued initiatives aimed at bolstering manufacturing and increasing exports. His administration has streamlined regulations and improved ports. Yet despite some high-profile developments like Apple moving the assembly of some iPhones to India, manufacturing makes up only 13 percent of the country’s economy, according to World Bank data. That is a lower share than a decade ago, when Mr. Modi took office. Foreign money has flowed into India’s stock markets, multiplying share prices, a key element of Mr. Modi’s pro-business image. But persuading international investors to put money directly into Indian companies — a riskier bet — has been a harder sell. His Hindu nationalist party has demonized the Muslim minority, a source of social ferment that has raised fears of instability. The election could further discourage additional investment, because Mr. Modi will likely have a more difficult time gaining passage of stalled reforms sought by business, including laws making it easier to amass land and hire and fire workers. With no clear pathway toward economic dynamism and more challenging political circumstances, Mr. Modi might resort to a time-honored method of shoring up support: He will expand social welfare programs, tapping government coffers to hand out more cash to communities in need. Such a course could potentially diminish available funding for the advancement of the government’s signature program — its aggressive construction of highways, ports, airports and other infrastructure. Those plans are central to maintaining India’s strong economic growth and the broader campaign to encourage investment in manufacturing. Some fear that any short-term pursuit of political favor through the scattering of money could undermine the longer-term project of spurring jobs through the promotion of industry. “You need to ensure that the benefits of economic development reach the maximum number of people,” said Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at Global Data.TS Lombard, a forecasting and consulting firm in London. “If people keep depending on welfare and are not getting the benefits of economic development, then it basically just creates stagnation.” Geopolitical alterations appear to give India a fresh crack at growing its manufacturing base. As the United States and China engage in trade hostilities, multinational brands are seeking to reduce their heavy dependence on Chinese factories to make their goods. Major retailers like Walmart are increasingly looking to India as an alternative to China. But capturing that potential investment demands continued upgrading of highways, rail connections and ports, along with a focus on vocational training to give people the needed skills to take up factory work. Even before the election, there were doubts that Mr. Modi’s administration was moving quickly enough to realize these gains. “India is a counterweight to China in terms of geopolitics, and we will continue to see some of that investment flowing,” Ms. Deveshwar said. “But the scale at which they are provisioning the ecosystem for these opportunities just is not large enough.”",indian election

nytimes,The World Heads to the Polls,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/climate/global-elections-climate-change-policy.html,"One of the busiest election cycles in history is coming to an end on Sunday. Hundreds of millions of people have gone to the polls in South Africa, India and Mexico in recent days, and millions more will do the same in the European Union this weekend. As Somini Sengupta has explained in a series of articles this week, among the issues that the new leaders of these countries will face: how to transition away from coal, how to adapt to record-breaking heat and, in Europe’s case, how to address a growing backlash against environmental policies. Today, I want to lay out some the most pressing environmental challenges in these areas, and what the results announced in the past few days point to. Keep in mind that whatever happens in the United States election in November will affect many of these countries, too. The biggest takeaway from India’s elections, as my colleagues who cover the country put it, is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “lost his aura of invincibility.” His Bharatiya Janata Party still won far more seats than any other party, and Modi is set to take up his third consecutive term as prime minister. But his party didn’t win an outright majority and now needs coalition partners to stay in power. Many critics of the current government see the result as good news for democracy, because Modi will be forced to seek support from more moderate allies. It could also bring some relief to activists like Ritwick Dutta, an environmental lawyer whose efforts to defend nature in India have made him a target of the government. But it’s unclear how fewer seats in Parliament will affect Modi’s environmental policies. The main challenges facing the next Indian government are what to do about the effects of climate change, including heat waves that have killed dozens of people. During the elections, at least 33 poll workers were among them, and the heat also closed schools in several states,",one busiest election cycle history coming end sunday hundred million people gone poll south africa india mexico recent day million european union weekend somini sengupta explained series article week among issue new leader country face transition away coal adapt recordbreaking heat europe case address growing backlash environmental policy today want lay pressing environmental challenge area result announced past day point keep mind whatever happens united state election november affect many country biggest takeaway india election colleague cover country put prime minister narendra modi lost aura invincibility bharatiya janata party still far seat party modi set take third consecutive term prime minister party didnt win outright majority need coalition partner stay power many critic current government see result good news democracy modi forced seek support moderate ally could also bring relief activist like ritwick dutta environmental lawyer whose effort defend nature india made target government unclear fewer seat parliament affect modis environmental policy main challenge facing next indian government effect climate change including heat wave killed dozen people election least poll worker among heat also closed school several state
nytimes,Narendra Modi’s India,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/briefing/modis-india.html,"Narendra Modi has just won re-election as India’s prime minister, though by a far narrower margin than expected. With his third consecutive term, the charismatic strongman has still sealed his position as the country’s most significant leader in generations. Despite having led India for a decade, Modi has in some ways kept his country guessing about his vision. On major issues — India’s relationships, its economy, its society and its government — it’s still unclear what sort of country Modi wants India to be. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain four of the big questions. India has spent recent years deepening its relationship with the United States. It has gotten closer to American allies, including Japan and Australia, and ordered high-end American weapons systems — the kind that create dependence down the road. And it is unlikely to side with China. In 2020, Chinese troops crossed into territory controlled by India and killed 20 soldiers in a skirmish. Modi has kept Beijing at arm’s length since then. But Modi, 73, has signaled that he doesn’t want to be a U.S. ally. Some officials in his inner circle still regard the United States warily. American diplomats complain about New Delhi’s apparent efforts to erode democratic norms and the rights of minority groups. So India keeps its options open. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States tried in vain to persuade India to take a stand against the war. India still processes Russian oil (picking up the slack created by international sanctions). It still buys weapons from Russia. India spent the Cold War trying to position itself as a nonaligned power. Old habits die hard. India recently overtook China as the most populous country and the fastest-growing large economy. Still, most of the country remains poor. Some 800 million people need help filling their stomachs. Modi’s ideas about how to help them can be contradictory — they’re both globally minded and protectionist.",narendra modi reelection india prime minister though far narrower margin expected third consecutive term charismatic strongman still sealed position country significant leader generation despite led india decade modi way kept country guessing vision major issue india relationship economy society government still unclear sort country modi want india today newsletter ill explain four big question india spent recent year deepening relationship united state gotten closer american ally including japan australia ordered highend american weapon system kind create dependence road unlikely side china chinese troop crossed territory controlled india killed soldier skirmish modi kept beijing arm length since modi signaled doesnt want u ally official inner circle still regard united state warily american diplomat complain new delhi apparent effort erode democratic norm right minority group india keep option open russia invaded ukraine united state tried vain persuade india take stand war india still process russian oil picking slack created international sanction still buy weapon russia india spent cold war trying position nonaligned power old habit die hard india recently overtook china populous country fastestgrowing large economy still country remains poor million people need help filling stomach modis idea help contradictory theyre globally minded protectionist
nytimes,"In Global Elections, Strongmen Are Taken Down a Notch","June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/world/global-elections-india-turkey-democracy.html,"In India, a powerful leader wins another term but sees his party’s majority vanish. In South Africa, the governing party is humbled by voters for the first time since the end of apartheid. In Britain, a populist insurgent barges into an election that is shaping up to be a crushing defeat for the long-ruling Conservatives. If there is a common thread halfway through this global year of elections, it is a desire by voters to send a strong signal to the powers that be — if not quite a wholesale housecleaning, then a defiant shake-up of the status quo. Even in Mexico, where Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and the handpicked successor of the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was elected in a landslide last Sunday, voters were rewarding the forces that had uprooted the country’s entrenched establishment only six years earlier. With a billion-plus people going to the polls in more than 60 countries, some analysts had feared that 2024 would pose a fateful test for democracy — one that it might fail. For years, populist and strongmen leaders have chipped away at democratic institutions, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of elections, while social media has swamped voters with disinformation and conspiracy theories. In some of the biggest, most fragile democracies, leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey had been regarded as close to invincible, using appeals to nationalism or sectarianism to mobilize supporters and bending institutions to suit their purposes. Yet now, Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan have both had their wings clipped. Soaring inflation, chronic unemployment and uneven economic growth have widened inequality in India, Turkey and elsewhere, frustrating voters who have shown a willingness to buck the establishment. “We do have electoral systems that are producing outcomes the governing parties didn’t want,” said Ben Ansell, a professor of comparative democratic institutions at the University of Oxford. “They’ve all been destabilized by a tricky economic environment, and behaving like strongmen hasn’t saved them.” Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan remain in power, each now in his third term. But Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., lost dozens of seats and will have to govern in a coalition with two secular parties. Turkey’s opposition struck a blow against Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party in April, winning a string of local elections and solidifying its control of important cities like Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. “In a lot of countries where there’s been talk of backsliding, that’s where we’ve seen a bounce back,” Professor Ansell said. “For Modi and Erdogan, taking the sheen off their infallibility was very important.” With so many elections in so many countries, it is dangerous to generalize. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia rolled up 88 percent of the vote in a landslide re-election victory in March that spoke less to Russian public sentiment and more to the ability of an autocrat, facing no meaningful opposition, to stage-manage a show of support for his war in Ukraine. In Europe, far-right parties are expected to perform well in European Parliament elections, which began on Thursday. Analysts said they did not believe this would jeopardize the political center that has governed Europe in the post-World War II era. And Poland provided a source of reassurance last fall, when voters pushed out its nationalist Law and Justice Party in favor of a more liberal opposition. Still, the success of far-right figures like Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy, attests to the enduring appeal of populism. “Populists and right-wingers will continue to make gains and strike fear into the European political establishment,” the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said in its analysis of the top risks of 2024. Britain’s general election was shaken up on Monday when Nigel Farage, a populist politician, pro-Brexit campaigner and ally of former President Donald J. Trump, announced he would run for a seat in Parliament under the banner of his Reform U.K. party, which has a strident anti-immigration message. That will add to the headache for the Conservative Party, which has lagged the opposition Labour Party by double digits in polls for nearly 18 months. Reform, which is fielding candidates across the country, could siphon off Conservative votes among those who blame the party for a weak economy and rising immigration numbers since Britain left the European Union in 2020. Some critics argue that the Conservative Party’s problems stem from its free-market policies, which they say have disillusioned voters in disadvantaged parts of Britain and set it apart from right-wing parties in Europe or Mr. Trump’s Make America Great Again movement in the United States. More fundamentally, though, the Conservatives have been in power for 14 years, and they face the same pent-up dissatisfaction with the status quo that fueled the recent elections in India, South Africa and Turkey. In some countries, the urge to break with the past has led voters to make unorthodox choices: Javier Milei, a flamboyant libertarian economist, swept to power in Argentina last November with a promise to close its central bank and wage an all-out assault on what he described as a corrupt political “caste.” Some analysts argue that similarly disruptive forces are driving the presidential race in the United States, where a comparatively healthy economy and the advantages of incumbency have not spared President Biden, who faces a neck-and-neck challenge from Mr. Trump even after the former president was convicted of multiple felonies. “It’s not about left versus right, it’s about the status quo versus change,” said Frank Luntz, an American political strategist who has lived and worked in Britain. “You can’t buy a house in the U.K., the N.H.S. doesn’t work,” he said, referring to the National Health Service. “In the United States, you can’t afford housing or health care. It’s about broken promises, year after year after year.” That sense of betrayal is even more acute in countries like South Africa, where the African National Congress, or A.N.C., has governed since the start of democracy there in 1994, piling up majorities even as the economy and social infrastructure crumbled. Last week, voters finally rebelled, driving down the A.N.C.’s vote share to 40 percent, from 58 percent in the last national election in 2019. Among their biggest complaints is the lack of job opportunities: South Africa’s unemployment rate — at 42 percent, including those who have stopped looking for work — is one of the highest in the world. Stagnation has widened the country’s already profound inequality. South Africans flock to cities looking for work. But many end up in decrepit buildings and slapdash shack communities, often without running water or sanitary toilets. Regular power outages leave streets dark and residents of many communities vulnerable to crime. South Africa’s murder rate is six and a half times as high as that of the United States and 45 times as high as Germany’s. Jacob Zuma, the scandal-scarred former president, has benefited from this misery, helping start a new party, umKhonto weSizwe, or M.K., which won nearly 15 percent of the vote, mostly at the expense of his former party, the A.N.C. Mr. Zuma attracts a feverish following among disillusioned A.N.C. supporters, who accuse the party of selling out to wealthy white businesspeople and not moving aggressively enough to redistribute wealth to the Black majority after apartheid. India’s election was a comparable anti-incumbent revolt, even if Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. is still the largest party in Parliament by a wide margin. The party’s campaign spending was at least 20 times as much as that of its main opposition, the Congress Party, which had its bank accounts frozen by the government in a tax dispute on the eve of the election. The country’s news outlets have been largely bought off or bullied into silence. And yet, the results showed Mr. Modi, 73, losing his majority for the first time since he took office in 2014. Analysts said that reflected widespread dissatisfaction with how the fruits of India’s economy have been shared. While India’s steady growth has made it the envy of its neighbors — and created a conspicuous billionaire class — those riches have not flowed to the hundreds of millions of India’s poor. The government has handed out free rations of wheat, grain and cooking gas. It offers home water connections, subsidizes building supplies and gives farmers cash. But it has not tackled India’s inflation or unemployment, leaving hundreds of millions of people, especially women, chronically out of work. There is also some evidence that Mr. Modi’s appeals to Hindu nationalism were not as potent as in previous elections. The B.J.P.’s candidate did not even win the constituency that is home to the lavish Ram temple, built on grounds disputed by Hindus and Muslims. Mr. Modi inaugurated the temple just before the campaign started, hoping it would galvanize his Hindu political base. The economy figured into Mexico’s election as well, but in a very different way. While overall growth was disappointing — averaging only 1 percent a year during Mr. López Obrador’s term — the government doubled the minimum wage and strengthened the peso, lifting millions of Mexicans out of poverty. “People vote with their wallets, and it’s very obvious there’s more money in the wallets of almost everybody in Mexico,” said Diego Casteñeda Garza, a Mexican economist and historian at Uppsala University in Sweden. Still, analysts said, there was also a desire among voters to cement the change that Mr. López Obrador, a charismatic outsider, symbolized when he came to power in 2018. Even as Ms. Sheinbaum, 61, vowed to continue her mentor’s policies, she cast herself — Mexico’s first female and Jewish president — as a change agent. For Jacqueline González, 33, who works at a cargo transportation company and viewed Mexico’s previous governments as corrupt, that made voting for Ms. Sheinbaum an easy decision. “With Obrador we have already seen, although some people don’t want to admit it, some change,” Ms. González said. “Let’s hope it continues with Sheinbaum.”",india powerful leader win another term see party majority vanish

nytimes,"Rahul Gandhi, Long on the Ropes, Looks Set for an Unexpected Comeback","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-congress-rahul-gandhi.html,"Just last year, Rahul Gandhi and the once-powerful party he led, the Indian National Congress, seemed to be on the ropes and little threat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s consolidation of political power. Congress had not been a competitive factor in national elections in years, winning fewer and fewer votes each time Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party was elected. And Mr. Gandhi himself had been convicted on a slander charge and barred from holding a seat in Parliament. But on Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi and a broad opposition coalition led by his Congress party registered a far stronger showing than expected in India’s elections, setting the stage for an unlikely comeback. “He has finally arrived,” said Rasheed Kidwai, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi. “This time he has improved his vote share by at least 17 million votes, which is very substantial.” On Wednesday, Mr. Modi’s party announced that it had reached an agreement to form a governing coalition, including two parties that do not necessarily share its vision. Congress won 99 seats in the 543-seat Parliament, a gain of 47 seats, and the alliance of which it is the leading part won a total of 232. Congress and its alliance of over two dozen political groups have presented the results as a “moral victory” over a B.J.P. government that they say was trying to change the country’s Constitution and have portrayed as anathema to India’s identity as a multifaith and secular country. “The fight was to save the Constitution,” Mr. Gandhi, the son, grandson and great-grandson of Congress prime ministers, said as the results poured in. The first major sign that Congress might be able to contend came in May 2023, just a couple of months after Mr. Gandhi’s conviction for slander, when his party won the state government of Karnataka, in the south of India, from the B.J.P. The lift was temporary; Congress soon lost power in three states it governed to the B.J.P. But at the same time, political experts say, Mr. Gandhi was pushing for changes within the party, India’s oldest, which had long resisted overhauling an archaic organizational structure that kept its top leaders isolated from the grass-roots workers who deliver votes. Feelings that Congress’s leaders were corrupt and out of touch resulted in a string of defeats over a number of years and then degenerated into messy infighting within the party. For the past two years, party members say, Mr. Gandhi has tried to reverse the decline of Congress by surrounding himself with young policy analysts to help him understand the challenges facing India, as well as party veterans with their ears to the ground in towns and villages that Congress was targeting. The party has in addition improved its social media game, trumpeting its messages on platforms like WhatsApp and YouTube. Mr. Gandhi also raised his profile by embarking on two walks across India — meeting farmers in their fields and vegetable sellers on city streets; and drinking tea with recent graduates and gig workers — in an effort to show common cause with ordinary people. Perhaps most important, Congress focused on a strategy of reaching out to and cooperating with key regional players across the country whose influence had dimmed under B.J.P. rule. Congress leaders made a series of “seat-sharing” agreements with regional leaders, big and small, that strengthened the alliance against Mr. Modi’s party. To avoid splitting the anti-B.J.P. vote, Congress had its own candidates contest fewer seats. And Mr. Gandhi campaigned vigorously alongside the leaders of like-minded political groups across India. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Gandhi also won support, party leaders say, by characterizing Mr. Modi as a leader who would destroy India’s secular character. “It is a victory not just for him and our alliance partners but for the millions of poor Indians who voted to protect the secular fabric of this country,” said Srinivas B.V., another Congress leader, about Mr. Gandhi. “People showed Modi: ‘You are not God, and you can be replaced.’” Since being voted to power in 2014, Mr. Modi has sought to position Hinduism, the religion of some 80 percent of Indians, at the center of the country’s official identity. He also promised to end corruption, overhaul the economy and help India become a “developed nation” by 2047. But after his re-election in 2019, he leaned into Hindu themes to a greater extent. Mr. Gandhi’s efforts to contrast his vision for India with Mr. Modi’s largely paid off, analysts say, even if some members of his party jumped ship and sided with the B.J.P. Many of the politicians who defected from Congress to the B.J.P. lost their seats, including in West Bengal and Maharashtra, where Congress and its partners did especially well. Throughout the campaign Mr. Gandhi persistently linked Mr. Modi with Gautam Adani, Asia’s richest man, saying the prime minister was working for his tycoon friends, not for the vast majority of Indians who are poor. As if to vindicate this line of attack, over the two days after the election results were announced, the price of Mr. Adani’s flagship stock fell by 14 percent. (It then recovered somewhat on Wednesday.) “People directly correlate Adani Ji with Modi Ji — directly,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters after the results, using Hindi honorifics for the two men. Researchers who traveled across India during the voting said Mr. Gandhi had beaten Mr. Modi on his own turf in many places by focusing on issues like the millions of Indians without jobs and the economic difficulties faced by farmers. He also accused the B.J.P. of governance failures and worked with local political groups fighting for social justice and for the empowerment of lower-caste Indians. Uttar Pradesh, where Mr. Modi made dozens of visits to campaign for local candidates, is one state where the changing fortunes of the two largest political groupings was evident. The state is India’s largest, and accounts for 80 of the Parliament’s 543 seats. The B.J.P. recorded its worst performance there since 2009, in part because Mr. Gandhi was able to craft an alliance with a powerful local leader, Akhilesh Yadav. In addition to the 37 seats picked up by Mr. Yadav’s Samajwadi Party, Congress won six, helped by aggressive campaigning by Mr. Gandhi’s sister, Priyanka Vadra, who helped defeat a former soap-opera actress who had served as a minister in Mr. Modi’s government. The B.J.P. won 33 seats, down from 62 in the previous Parliament. The election results announced on Wednesday have given a major lift to hundreds of thousands of Congress workers across the country, who were growing tired of the internal infighting that has plagued their party for years. Outside Congress headquarters in New Delhi, Bansi Lal Meena, a veteran Congress member from the state of Rajasthan, was exultant about his party’s performance. “In villages and on the ground, the B.J.P. spread lies for years against us — saying that we are anti-Hindu,” he said. “They used my religion as a weapon against me to win votes.” He added: “We will show them now because our people are also in Parliament.”",last year rahul gandhi oncepowerful party led indian national congress seemed rope little threat prime minister narendra modis consolidation political power congress competitive

nytimes,Narendra Modi Fell to Earth After Making It All About Himself,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-election-modi.html,"When everything became about Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, his party and its century-old Hindu-nationalist network were propelled to unimagined heights. On the back of his singular charisma and political skill, a onetime-fringe religious ideology was pulled to the center of Indian life. Landslide election victories remade India’s politics, once dominated by diverse coalitions representing a nation that had shaped its independence on secular principles. But there were always risks in wrapping a party’s fortunes so completely in the image of one man, in inundating a country of many religions, castes and cultures with that leader’s name, face and voice. Voters could start to think that everything was about him, not them. They could even revolt. On Tuesday, Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., fell back to earth. After having promised their biggest election romp yet, they lost more than 60 seats. Mr. Modi will remain in office for a third term, but only with the help of a contentious coalition of parties, some of which are opposed to his core beliefs and want power of their own. With the result, India’s strained democracy appeared to roar back to life, its beaten-down political opposition reinvigorated. And after a decade in which Mr. Modi’s success in entrenching Hindu supremacy had often felt like the new common sense, India is seeing its leader and itself in a new light, and trying to understand this unexpected turn. Most fundamentally, the opposition, newly coalesced for what it called a do-or-die moment as Mr. Modi increasingly tilted the playing field, found a way to use the cult of personality around him to its advantage. Opposition leaders focused on bread-and-butter issues, often at granular levels in particular constituencies. They hammered Mr. Modi over persistent unemployment and stark inequality. But the B.J.P., with Mr. Modi from on high its only spokesman, was often left with just one answer: Trust in “Modi’s guarantee.” “The ‘Modi’s guarantee’ slogan turned out to be our undoing,” said Ajay Singh Gaur, a B.J.P. worker who had campaigned in the party stronghold of Uttar Pradesh, the northern state where Mr. Modi suffered his biggest blow on Tuesday, losing nearly half of the B.J.P. seats. “The opposition made that sound like this was not about him having delivered, or trying to deliver,” Mr. Gaur said, “but about him being an arrogant politician.” Mr. Modi gave his adversaries a lot to work with, even declaring that he may not be “biological” and that he had been sent by God. He has still emerged better so far than other Indian leaders who deeply centralized power. He remains in control of levers of power that could help him and his party restore their dominance. Indira Gandhi, who had also glorified herself and went so far as to suspend India’s democracy after declaring a national emergency, was voted out at the peak of her powers before returning three years later. But Mr. Modi’s B.J.P., the world’s largest political party, finds itself in a tough spot after years of centralization and reliance on a government machinery put to the service of one man, analysts say. The huge advantage the party has built in numbers and resources is undercut by a lack of internal consultation and delegation of authority. That was a key reason for its failure in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, with 240 million people, and surrounding states. Local B.J.P. leaders were disenchanted by a top-down approach toward choosing candidates, as well as what they called a misguided belief that Mr. Modi’s popularity could allow the party to sidestep potent local issues and caste factors. With Mr. Modi sucking up all the oxygen at the top, other senior leaders of the party have been left to fight for relevance and a voice. His relentless self-promotion has also alienated the leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., the B.J.P.’s right-wing fountainhead. During election seasons, the R.S.S. activates its vast grass-roots network in support of B.J.P. candidates. While Mr. Modi, a former foot soldier in the organization, has advanced many of its goals, his consolidation of power goes against its regimented nature and its focus on ideology over individual personalities. One R.S.S. insider, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking, said that Mr. Modi’s exalting of himself had created such resentment inside the group that some of its leaders welcomed any sort of reality check for him, short of his ouster. Sudheendra Kulkarni, a political analyst who served as an aide to the first B.J.P. prime minister in the 1990s, said Mr. Modi had pushed through unpopular legislation — in particular farm laws that prompted a yearlong protest that choked New Delhi — without consulting with party officials in the affected states. They were left to cope with the ramifications. “The B.J.P. was never a one-leader party,” Mr. Kulkarni said. “All that changed with Narendra Modi in 2014. He sought to promote a new authoritarian idea of one nation, one leader.” Hypothesizing that Mr. Modi’s popularity had peaked, the opposition saw an opening to go after a decisive section of votes in the Indian political formula. For decades before his rise in 2014, neither the B.J.P. nor the Indian National Congress, the country’s two largest parties, could muster majorities on its own. Mr. Modi expanded his party’s backing by consolidating right-wing Hindu voters and drawing in new supporters with his personal story of a humble caste and economic background and a promise to change lives through robust development. A decade later, in this year’s election, the opposition found traction in painting a very different picture of Mr. Modi — as an autocratic friend of billionaires. Since Mr. Modi had achieved everything he had set out to do, the opposition argued, his pursuit of a resounding majority could only mean that he would seek radical change to the Constitution. That claim stirred anxiety among India’s Dalits and other underprivileged groups, who see the Constitution as their only protection in a deeply unequal society, guaranteeing them a share of government jobs and seats in higher education as well as elected bodies. The opposition was able to push the message harder when some in Mr. Modi’s right-wing support base, long seen as having an upper-caste bias, called for revoking the quotas. Caste identity was a major driving factor for voters in many states, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, with its 80 parliamentary seats. The decline of a Dalit party in the state meant that about 20 percent of the votes were potentially up for grabs. In Ayodhya, the constituency where Mr. Modi inaugurated a grand Ram temple earlier this year in an effort to consolidate his Hindu support base, the opposition put up a Dalit candidate. He handily defeated the B.J.P.’s two-term incumbent. In other cases, voters showed their anger over the B.J.P.’s perceived sense of impunity. In Kheri, a constituency where the son of a B.J.P. minister rammed his S.U.V. into a crowd of protesting farmers, killing several, the minister also lost. Mr. Modi’s election campaign took its most divisive turn in Banswara, in the desert state of Rajasthan, where he called India’s 200 million Muslims “infiltrators” and raised fears that the opposition would give them India’s wealth, including Hindu women’s necklaces. Banswara’s B.J.P. incumbent was routed in the election. While the loss was most likely attributable to local issues, the national discussion noted that Mr. Modi’s comments had not helped. In his own constituency of Varanasi, in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Modi’s winning margin of nearly half a million votes in 2019 shrank to about 150,000 — a disappointing showing after he had dispatched some of the B.J.P.’s most senior leaders to camp out there to help him achieve an even bigger victory. Jai Prakash, a tea and samosa seller in Varanasi, said some of the prime minister’s work, particularly his improvement of roads, was popular. But Mr. Modi was losing the plot, Mr. Prakash said, by turning to issues disconnected from people’s day-to-day lives. “Prices are skyrocketing; so is unemployment,” Mr. Prakash said. “He has done some good. But people cannot worship him endlessly.”",everything became prime minister narendra modi india party centuryold hindunationalist network propelled unimagined height back singular charisma political

nytimes,"India Keeps Its Glorious, Messy Tradition Alive","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/opinion/india-election-modi-bjp-democracy.html,"Back in January, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India looked all but unstoppable, he visited the small city of Ayodhya for the unofficial start of his campaign to win a third term. The location was freighted with symbolism. For decades, Hindu nationalists had sought to build a temple in Ayodhya, at a spot they believe to be the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. The only problem was that there was already a house of worship on the spot, a mosque built by a Mughal emperor in 1528. A Hindu mob had dismantled the mosque in 1992, setting off riots that killed 2,000 people, most of them Muslims. The ruins were a flashpoint of religious tensions in India for decades. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party promised to build the temple, and the lavish event at which Modi officially opened it was a showcase for that achievement. At the time it seemed like strong election-year messaging for a politician who built his career on the twin planks of Hindu nationalism and building a muscular new India. Unlike other politicians, the event implied, Modi made promises and kept them. “It is the beginning of a new era,” he declared. Feeling supremely confident, Modi had boldly asked the Indian electorate for something akin to a blank check to remake the country — control of 400 seats in Parliament in elections that began in April and concluded on June 1. And why shouldn’t he have been confident? India’s economy was the fastest-growing in the world. India had overtaken China as the world’s most-populous country. World leaders sought Modi’s support on issues ranging from the war in Ukraine to the climate crisis, cementing India’s ascent in global affairs. But the ever unpredictable electorate of the world’s largest democracy responded to Modi’s demand for still more power resolutely: No thanks. In a stunning rebuke, election results released on Tuesday showed that India’s voters have reduced the parliamentary share of Modi’s party by more than 60 seats, not enough for an outright majority, never mind the supermajority he had sought. It struck me as particularly apt that despite all the fanfare about the glorious new temple in Ayodhya, Modi’s party lost the city’s parliamentary seat to a political opposition that had been all but left for dead. There appears to be a clear ceiling to the appeals to Hindu identity on its own. “We are very happy with the temple, but people were fed up with the B.J.P.,” a local business leader, Rakesh Yadav, told Reuters. “People will not always fall for the caste or temple-mosque politics. They also want to see development.” This is a big year for democracy, almost a referendum of sorts on the very idea. Dozens of countries are holding elections, representing roughly half of the world’s population. But authoritarianism has been on the march. The latest report from Freedom House found that by many measures, global freedom has declined for the 18th straight year. India, despite its status as the world’s most-populous democracy, has been a poster child for this decline under Modi: His government has taken aim at just about every form of freedom. He has attacked and grievously weakened the independence of India’s once boisterous press. He has jailed critics and political opponents. He has sharpened religious animosity, referring during this campaign to Muslims, who make up 14 percent of India’s population, as “infiltrators” who seek to steal wealth and power from the Hindu majority. It’s an Indian edition of the nationalist, populist playbook playing out around the world. That a newly unified opposition managed to prevent Modi’s party from winning an outright majority under these conditions took everyone, including me, by surprise. And it suggests that even when would-be authoritarians attempt to tilt the playing field, voters can and will state their will, no matter the autocrat’s preferences. “The B.J.P. had positioned itself as a new hegemonic power,” Yamini Aiyar, a scholar and analyst of Indian democracy who has been a frequent target of Hindu nationalist rage, told me. “The beauty of an election is that politicians have to go to the people, and the people get an opportunity to express their anxieties and their perspectives.” Express them they did. Looking back, the weakness of the B.J.P.’s re-election case is clear: Yes, India’s economy was growing fast. But despite the flashy new infrastructure projects and deals to increase high-tech manufacturing, the growth was not creating nearly enough jobs, and inflation remained stubbornly high, especially for food, which hits the poorest hardest. Much of the wealth generated by growth has gone to India’s richest tycoons, and inequality has soared. “The reality is that the real economy has been hurting for a very long time, and they have systematically sought to ignore it,” Aiyar said. India has managed to lift millions of people out of poverty since Modi came to power 10 years ago, but particularly in rural areas, where most Indians live, that has meant social welfare rather than jobs. There were other issues too — Modi’s allies had floated the idea of changing India’s Constitution in various ways, including removing its commitment to secularism and enshrining Hinduism as the national faith. These kinds of appeals have helped the B.J.P. in the past but seem to have had less power this time around. One clear sign was its heavy losses in Uttar Pradesh, which is not just India’s most populous state; it is also part of the heavily Hindu heartland of northern India. It also seems that the opposition may finally have gotten its act together. India’s main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, has been in decline for years and had struggled to make common cause with other opposition parties in previous elections. But this year the opposition parties managed to make a much stronger coalition. They focused on kitchen table issues and highlighted the Modi government’s ties to big business and high-flying billionaires. The opposition didn’t shy away from making the stakes for Indian democracy clear. But the relentless focus on what voters said mattered most offers lessons for those battling revanchist movements elsewhere, including in the United States. Sometimes you need to meet voters where they are. This vote wasn’t a total rebuke of Modi and his policies. He is all but certain to get his third term as prime minister by making a coalition with allied parties. But it is a clear and salutary check on his authoritarian project. This election is also a rebuke of Indian elites — in business and media especially — who had willingly surrendered to a kind of inevitability of Modi’s long-term consolidation of power, making peace with it or even celebrating it. Activists, analysts and journalists who had the temerity to speak plainly about Modi’s revanchist project and the threat he posed to the world’s biggest democracy and its long history of tolerance, secularism and free speech have been hounded out of public life. I hope that this troubling slide ends now. As the results rolled in on Tuesday, I remembered my own reporting trip to Ayodhya in 2009, when I was a correspondent for The Times based in India. An explosive new government report had just been issued about the destruction of the mosque and the role of Hindu nationalist groups in stirring up violence. But when I got there, I was surprised to find that on the hotly contested spot itself there was hardly any hoopla. The crowds of Hindu nationalist volunteers who for years had routinely shown up to build the temple with their bare hands had disappeared. India was going through a period of hopeful prosperity. Voters had just returned the Indian National Congress party and its allies to power with a larger majority, and a brilliant, teetotaling economist named Manmohan Singh was prime minister. With the future looking so alluring, no one seemed all that interested in litigating the past. These hopes were ultimately dashed amid scandals over political corruption and mismanagement. The Congress party, which once seemed unstoppable, lost power in 2014 for failing to deliver on its promise to bring India to its long-awaited place among the world’s richest and most powerful nations. The years ahead will, with any luck, be ones of negotiation and compromise. This will be a return to form for India, a vastly diverse nation whose unruly polity has resisted autocracy at every turn since it shrugged off British colonial rule in 1947. The whole world should breathe a sigh of relief that India’s voters have spoken, loudly, in favor of continuing that glorious, messy tradition.",back january prime minister narendra modi india looked

nytimes,The New Kingmakers Who Could Make or Break Modi’s Government,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-elections-modi-coalition.html,"After his first two national election victories, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India easily set his own terms, with his Bharatiya Janata Party winning clear majorities. The result was different in this vote. It was still a victory, but one that left him dependent on a host of coalition partners — particularly on politicians from two regional parties who could make or break Mr. Modi’s ability to form a government. Of the more than a dozen parties that make up the B.J.P.’s coalition, known as the National Democratic Alliance, most won just one or two seats, leaving the party in a difficult predicament. On Wednesday, the B.J.P. said it had reached an agreement to form a coalition government that includes those two regional parties — the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United. They will be the biggest junior partners, but they are also avowedly secular and removed from Mr. Modi’s Hindu-nationalist ideology. Cameras on Wednesday followed every word, meeting and movement of the leaders of the two parties, N. Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party, and Nitish Kumar of Janata Dal-United. Their combined 28 seats in Parliament will give the prime minister the votes he needs to stay in power and push through his agenda. Here is what to know about the men who unexpectedly found themselves as kingmakers, and about the parties they lead. Though some of the members of the B.J.P.’s coalition this year share Mr. Modi’s hard-line vision, both the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United are moderate, secular parties that have a diverse support base. Speculation in India was focusing on what terms the men were demanding for their support, which are unlikely to be rooted in ideology. Both Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar are known to be pragmatic, deal-making politicians whose priorities will be practical concessions for their state, or perhaps cabinet positions. Mr. Kumar has earned a reputation in India for his willingness to switch allegiances over the past decade. He has gone between aligning himself with the B.J.P.-led coalition to supporting its rivals no fewer than five times. Most recently, in January, he returned to Mr. Modi’s alliance just 18 months after he’d left it and with just months to go until the election. He has said his switching of political loyalties was in the interest of his state, Bihar. Mr. Naidu has also at times broken with Mr. Modi, cutting ties with the B.J.P. in 2018 and joining forces with its chief rival, Indian National Congress, ahead of the 2019 elections. He has said that his party has aligned with the B.J.P. out of “political compulsion.” Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar have both been in politics for decades, and have been mentioned as potential candidates for prime minister. Mr. Naidu of the T.D.P., based in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, is a technocrat who has aggressively pushed for investment from information technology companies in his region. His policies helped bring high-paying jobs for I.T. professionals and transformed the city of Hyderabad. Mr. Kumar is a nine-time chief minister of Bihar, India’s poorest state, who comes from a homegrown socialist background. He has pushed for more funds for low-caste Hindus, and his alliance with the B.J.P. broadened support for the party in his state.",first two national election victory prime minister narendra modi india easily set term bharatiya janata party winning clear majority result different vote still victory one left dependent host coalition partner particularly politician two regional party could make break mr modis ability form government dozen party make bjps coalition known national democratic alliance one two seat leaving party difficult predicament wednesday bjp said reached agreement form coalition government includes two regional party telugu desam party janata dalunited biggest junior partner also avowedly secular removed mr modis hindunationalist ideology camera wednesday followed every word meeting movement leader two party n chandrababu naidu telugu desam party nitish kumar janata dalunited combined seat parliament give prime minister vote need stay power push agenda know men unexpectedly found kingmaker party lead though member bjps coalition year share mr modis hardline vision telugu desam party janata dalunited moderate secular party diverse support base speculation india focusing term men demanding support unlikely rooted ideology mr naidu mr kumar known pragmatic dealmaking politician whose priority practical concession state perhaps cabinet position mr kumar earned reputation india willingness switch allegiance past decade gone aligning bjpled coalition supporting rival fewer five time recently january returned mr modis alliance month hed left month go election said switching political loyalty interest state bihar mr naidu also time broken mr modi cutting tie bjp joining force chief rival indian national congress ahead election said party aligned bjp political compulsion mr naidu mr kumar politics decade mentioned potential candidate prime minister mr naidu tdp based southern state andhra pradesh technocrat aggressively pushed investment information technology company region policy helped bring highpaying job professional transformed city hyderabad mr kumar ninetime chief minister bihar india poorest state come homegrown socialist background pushed fund lowcaste hindu alliance bjp broadened support party state
nytimes,"Modi se reelige en India, pero pierde mayoría parlamentaria: 4 claves de las elecciones","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/06/05/espanol/elecciones-india-modi.html,"[Estamos en WhatsApp. Empieza a seguirnos ahora] La primera década de Narendra Modi como primer ministro de India ha estado plagada de sorpresas. Ninguna, sin embargo, se comparó con lo que ocurrió el martes por la mañana, cuando Modi ganó su segunda reelección, pero su partido perdió la mayoría en el Parlamento. Con esa derrota, el aire de invencibilidad de Modi también pareció desvanecerse por primera vez desde que asumió el cargo en 2014. Los resultados de las elecciones fueron particularmente interesantes porque, tras casi siete semanas de votaciones en todo el país, las encuestas a pie de urna publicadas pocos días antes del recuento final mostraban que el Partido Popular Indio de Modi ganaría de forma aplastante, como ya había hecho en dos ocasiones anteriores. Sin embargo, el Partido Popular Indio solo obtuvo 239 escaños, muy por debajo de los 272 necesarios para formar gobierno. La alianza de la oposición, liderada por el Partido del Congreso Nacional Indio, obtuvo 235 escaños. Con los 52 escaños obtenidos por los aliados del Partido Popular Indio, Modi seguirá a la cabeza. Pero su atractivo ha disminuido y su liderazgo ha cambiado radicalmente. Cuando Modi llegó al poder en 2014, prometió progreso económico, el fin de la corrupción y la promoción del hinduismo como elemento central de la identidad india. Con todo ello, se presentó como un líder singularmente fuerte, capaz de reunir a sus seguidores para trabajar por la nación. Esto contrastaba con el gobierno anterior. Antes de que Modi fuera elegido por primera vez, India llevaba 25 años gobernada por coaliciones. Los primeros ministros del Partido del Congreso, del Partido Popular Indio y de terceros partidos más pequeños se alternaban para dirigir India por comités. Modi rompió con esa tradición y lideró un nuevo sistema de partido único dominado por el Partido Popular Indio. Como líder, Modi mostró poco interés en compartir el poder. Cuando invalidó la mayor parte del papel moneda de India en 2016, ni siquiera su ministro de Finanzas conocía la decisión de antemano. Cuando decidió imponer la ley marcial en Jammu y Cachemira, el único estado de mayoría musulmana de India, presentó el plan al Parlamento como un hecho, sin pedir su aprobación. Pero esos días han terminado. Los dos mayores partidos que han surgido como nuevos socios de coalición del Partido Popular Indio están liderados por N. Chandrababu Naidu y Nitish Kumar, legisladores veteranos a quienes se conoce como tecnócratas moderados. Es probable que ambos exijan más autoridad en el Parlamento. De hecho, ambos han sido señalados como posibles candidatos a primer ministro, si se produjera otra coalición que no estuviera liderada ni por el Partido Popular Indio ni por el Congreso Nacional Indio. Cuando el martes se dieron a conocer los primeros mapas electorales nacionales que mostraban el número de escaños ganados y perdidos en el Parlamento, se observó una nueva y sorprendente configuración. Los mapas mostraban que el partido de Modi había perdido zonas de territorio en los estados del norte de habla hindi, considerados bastiones del Partido Popular Indio. Al mismo tiempo, el su partido avanzó en regiones que se habían resistido a Modi en el pasado. Perdió decenas de escaños en el estado septentrional de Uttar Pradesh, pero ganó muchos en el estado oriental de Odisha y en el estado meridional de Telangana. La única parte del país que ahora parece unificada por un partido es el “cinturón tribal”, que atraviesa los estados centrales. Sus comunidades relativamente pobres han sido hábilmente puestas en la mira de la política hinduista y los beneficios sociales del Partido Popular Indio. Los inversores de los mercados bursátiles indios de Mumbai respondieron con entusiasmo a las primeras encuestas a pie de urna. El lunes, se lanzaron a la compra, haciendo subir los precios de las llamadas acciones de Modi, aquellas asociadas a las prioridades de gasto del primer ministro o que se cree que se benefician de sus políticas fiscales. Cuando se conocieron los resultados de las urnas, esas acciones se desplomaron. Las acciones del buque insignia del Grupo Adani perdieron cerca del 19 por ciento de su valor en un solo día de cotización. El índice bursátil perdió cerca del 6 por ciento, casi anulando las ganancias de los cinco primeros meses del año. Modi sigue siendo popular entre los magnates de India, pero los inversores deben averiguar qué empresas se beneficiarán del nuevo gobierno. Chris Wood, responsable mundial de estrategia de renta variable del banco de inversión Jefferies, advirtió el año pasado que si Modi perdía, “cabría esperar una corrección del 25 por ciento, si no más”, en el mercado bursátil indio. Históricamente, a las empresas indias les ha ido igual de bien durante los periodos de gobierno de coalición. Por lo tanto, Wood dijo que, incluso sin Modi en el poder, espera que las acciones “se recuperen bruscamente” sobre la base de la fortaleza de la economía del país en su conjunto. Esta nueva era en el Parlamento empezará seguramente con algunas rondas de retribuciones políticas. Los políticos que no hayan conseguido escaños para sus jefes serán despedidos. Es probable que los partidos más pequeños exijan puestos en el gabinete, lo que significará sustituir a miembros del Partido Popular Indio. Habrá que revisar las políticas. ¿Se inclinará India por la exportación de manufacturas, con el objetivo de sustituir a China como la fábrica del mundo? ¿Protegerá ahora a las industrias locales que temen la competencia extranjera? Milan Vaishnav, investigador de la Fundación Carnegie para la Paz Internacional, advirtió que India no puede volver exactamente a la política de coalición que precedió a Modi. Es probable que sus nuevos socios exijan un estilo autoritario similar al que Modi ejerce desde Nueva Delhi. El tipo de líderes estatales que necesita ahora como socios de coalición “son tan absolutistas como el gobierno nacional”, dijo Vaishnav. Podrían, por ejemplo, pedir a la policía federal que detuviera a sus oponentes, como ha hecho Modi. Las elecciones de India fueron las mayores celebradas en la historia de la democracia, con más de 600 millones de votantes en seis fases. Esta vez no hubo quejas sobre las máquinas de votación electrónica, ni temores de que India se hubiera convertido en una dictadura bajo el mandato de Modi. En un discurso difícil pronunciado el martes por la noche desde la sede del Partido Popular Indio, Modi calificó las elecciones de “celebración de la democracia”.",estamos en whatsapp empieza

nytimes,Man Accused in Plot to Assassinate Sikh Separatist Pleads Not Guilty,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/nyregion/nikhil-gupta-india-assassination-plot.html,"An Indian man pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of orchestrating a failed assassination plot against a Sikh separatist in New York, a plan that prosecutors say he devised on behalf of an unnamed official in India’s government. The defendant, Nikhil Gupta, 52, was arrested in the Czech Republic a year ago, and was extradited last week to make his first appearance in Manhattan federal court. He is accused of trying to arrange the murder of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American citizen and lawyer for a New York-based Sikh secessionist group. The murder attempt, which played out against a backdrop of doubt about India’s commitment to democracy, spanned several countries and mirrored the successful killing of another separatist in Canada, prosecutors say. On Monday morning, Mr. Gupta entered the Lower Manhattan courtroom in a blue cardigan and yellow patterned shirt and appeared relaxed as he spoke to his lawyer, Jeffrey Chabrowe, at the defense table. He has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since landing in the United States on Friday afternoon. In a statement to reporters after the arraignment, Mr. Chabrowe called the case a “complex matter"" for India and the United States. “Background and details will develop that may cast government allegations into an entirely new light,” he said. Mr. Gupta is charged with murder for hire and conspiracy to commit murder for hire. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison for each charge. He was sent back to the detention center after Monday’s arraignment and is set to appear in court again on June 28. In a statement Monday, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said Mr. Gupta will “now face justice” in an American courtroom. “This extradition makes clear that the Justice Department will not tolerate attempts to silence or harm American citizens,” he said. In an indictment unsealed in November, Manhattan federal prosecutors described an audacious plot that began around May 2023 when an Indian government employee enlisted Mr. Gupta to organize the killing of Mr. Pannun, who was living in New York at the time. Mr. Pannun is the general counsel of Sikhs for Justice, an organization that supports the secession of Punjab, a state in northern India. He is a vocal critic of the Indian government and has been banned from the country, prosecutors say. Mr. Gupta, who lived in India, had told the government official about “his involvement in international narcotics and weapons trafficking,” according to the indictment. At the direction of the Indian government employee, Mr. Gupta contacted a man who he believed would help him hire a hit man in New York, but who was, in fact, an agent for the American government. That agent introduced Mr. Gupta to an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration officer who pretended to be the hit man. In deals brokered by Mr. Gupta, the Indian government official agreed to pay the D.E.A. officer $100,000 to kill Mr. Pannun, including a $15,000 cash advance for the job, prosecutors said. Mr. Gupta then shared personal information about Mr. Pannun with the undercover officer, including Mr. Pannun’s address in New York and his phone number. When the Indian official asked for updates, Mr. Gupta relayed surveillance photos of Mr. Pannun that the agent had sent him. Mr. Gupta instructed the undercover officer to carry out the assassination as soon as possible, but asked him not to do it around the time of high-level meetings between U.S. and Indian officials, according to the indictment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington and met with President Biden in June 2023. Then, prosecutors said, on June 18 of that year, gunmen killed Hardeep Singh Nijjar, another Sikh separatist leader, in British Columbia, Canada. Mr. Nijjar knew Mr. Pannun and was also an outspoken critic of the Indian government. Soon after, prosecutors said, Mr. Gupta told the undercover officer that Mr. Nijjar “was also the target” and that “we have so many targets.” Mr. Gupta then told the officer — the pretend hit man — that there was “now no need to wait” to kill Mr. Pannun, prosecutors said. On Monday, Mr. Pannun said in a statement that he had “full faith” that the United States would hold Mr. Gupta and his co-conspirators accountable. “The attempt on my life on American soil is the blatant case of India’s transnational terrorism challenging America’s sovereignty and unequivocally proves that Modi’s India believes in using violence to suppress the dissenting political opinion,” he said. A spokesman for the Indian Embassy in Washington, D.C., could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday.

nytimes,Train Crash in India Leaves at Least 8 Dead and Dozens Injured,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/world/asia/india-train-crash.html,"A freight train collided with a passenger train in eastern India on Monday, killing at least eight people and injuring 50 others, officials said. The episode occurred at around 9 a.m. when the Kanchanjunga Express, which was carrying passengers to the state of West Bengal from the state of Tripura, was leaving the Rangapani station. Four coaches of the popular and often-crowded passenger train derailed when it was rammed from behind by the commercial train. Images from the accident site showed one of the passenger coaches lifted off the railway track and balancing on a coach of the freight train. The death toll was likely to rise. Local news outlets, citing police officials, reported at least 15 people dead. The driver and the assistant driver of the freight train and a guard on the passenger train were among those killed. Jaya Varma Sinha, the chairperson of India’s railway board, said rescue operations were completed. Ashwini Vaishnaw, India’s railway minister, was en route to the site. The relatively low number of casualties could be attributed to the fact that the rear portion of the Kanchanjunga Express, which took the biggest impact from the collision, comprised cargo coaches and the guard’s coach. Passengers were in compartments far forward from the impact. While an investigation has been ordered to look into the cause of the collision, Ms. Sinha said human error such as disregarding a railway signal could have caused the crash. The accident again brings to the fore the issue of rail safety in a country whose millions of poor residents rely on railways for transport. India’s rail network is one of the world’s largest and is crucial to the country’s economy and its people’s lives and livelihood. The country has, in recent years, invested heavily on rail safety after a long history of deadly accidents. Although the overall number of rail accidents has lessened over the past decade, incidents with mass casualties have persisted. Last June, 290 people were killed when two passenger trains collided after one of them struck a stationary freight train at full speed and derailed in the state of Odisha. After that incident, opposition leaders demanded the resignation of Mr. Vaishnaw, the railway minister. He has said he was trying to expand a safety system, called Kavach, that is meant to prevent accidents when two trains are moving on the same track. Ms. Sinha said the technology had not yet been deployed on the route of the Kanchanjunga Express.",freight train collided passenger train eastern india monday killing least eight people injuring others official said episode occurred around kanchanjunga express carrying passenger state west bengal state tripura leaving rangapani station four coach popular oftencrowded passenger train derailed rammed behind commercial train image accident site showed one passenger coach lifted railway track balancing coach freight train death toll likely rise local news outlet citing police official reported least people dead driver assistant driver freight train guard passenger train among killed jaya varma sinha chairperson india railway board said rescue operation completed ashwini vaishnaw india railway minister en route site relatively low number casualty could attributed fact rear portion kanchanjunga express took biggest impact collision comprised cargo coach guard coach passenger compartment far forward impact investigation ordered look cause collision m sinha said human error disregarding railway signal could caused crash accident brings fore issue rail safety country whose million poor resident rely railway transport india rail network one world largest crucial country economy people life livelihood country recent year invested heavily rail safety long history deadly accident although overall number rail accident lessened past decade incident mass casualty persisted last june people killed two passenger train collided one struck stationary freight train full speed derailed state odisha incident opposition leader demanded resignation mr vaishnaw railway minister said trying expand safety system called kavach meant prevent accident two train moving track m sinha said technology yet deployed route kanchanjunga express
nytimes,"G7 Leaders, Expanding the Circle, Shift Focus to Migration and the South","June 14, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/world/europe/g7-summit-ai-china-india.html,"The Group of 7 countries threw open the doors of their club on Friday to India, Brazil, Turkey and other non-Western countries, acknowledging a shifting global landscape as they tried to enlist these nations’ leaders in causes ranging from climate change to managing the economic competition with China. While diplomats from the Group of 7 hammered out a communiqué that pledged support for Ukraine in its war against Russia and greater ambition in curbing carbon emissions, the focus was on Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and other leaders from outside the G7, whose support is increasingly critical to achieving any of these goals. Among the thorny questions on the second day of the summit: migration, which has helped fuel a recent resurgence of populism and far-right parties in Europe and the United States. The leaders also discussed the war in Gaza and China’s state subsidies of industries like electric vehicles, which has prompted the United States and the European Union to impose tariffs on Chinese exports. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, who is hosting the gathering, said the goal of her expanded guest list was to “strengthen dialogue with the nations of the Global South.” She insisted that the Group of 7 was “not a fortress closed in itself” but “an offer of values that we open to the world.” Ms. Meloni recruited Pope Francis to speak to the leaders about the dangers posed by artificial intelligence. Francis urged them to regulate the technology, of which he was himself a victim when A.I.-generated fake images of him clad in a white puffer jacket and a jewel-encrusted crucifix went viral last year. “The benefits and the damages it causes will depend on the way it is used,” the pope declared, warning of the risks of A.I.’s uncontrolled development. He called for lethal autonomous weapons, which are unmanned and uncontrolled by a human hand, to be banned, saying, “No machine should ever decide whether to take the life of a human being away.” The pope’s appearance was the emotional highlight of a day of carefully staged summitry that seemed to concede that the West is less dominant demographically and economically than in the past — and that it is listening to calls for more equity and balance in global decision-making. As Ms. Meloni guided the pope, in a wheelchair, around a circular table to meet the leaders, he was greeted by a visibly moved President Biden and got an enthusiastic hug from Argentina’s flamboyant president, Javier Milei, whose election last November was viewed as another sign of the rising tide of populism across the Americas and Europe. This is not the first time non-Western leaders have been invited to a Group of 7 meeting, but rarely have they been so conspicuous. In part that reflects the issues that Ms. Meloni has highlighted: Africa and the Mediterranean. The leaders of Algeria, Kenya and Tunisia were on hand at a luxury resort hotel on Italy’s southern coast, as was President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. “Inviting key developing country leaders reflects the reality that confronting China and Russia requires the cooperation of more than the G7,” said Daniel M. Price, who was a top trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “And Brazil, India and Turkey are as concerned about Chinese predatory trade practices and overcapacity as are Japan, Europe and the U.S.” The final G7 communiqué voiced concern about what the leaders called China’s “persistent industrial targeting and comprehensive nonmarket policies and practices that are leading to global spillovers, market distortions and harmful overcapacity.” The communiqué endorsed Mr. Biden’s effort to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. France and Canada had pushed for stronger language on Israel’s conduct of the war, according to people familiar with the negotiations, but the United States and Germany resisted. In a victory for Ms. Meloni, a conservative who opposes abortion, the communiqué did not include an explicit reference to abortion, in a passage that pledged to promote “comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.” A communiqué released by the Group of 7 leaders after their last summit in Hiroshima, Japan, referred specifically to abortion rights. The issue injected a briefly discordant note into the gathering after President Emmanuel Macron of France told an Italian journalist that some politicians did not share France’s “vision of equality between women and men.” Ms. Meloni criticized Mr. Macron, who recently called a snap parliamentary election, as seeking to politicize the issue at a “precious forum like the G7.” For the most part, however, the meeting underscored harmony among the leaders, many of whom are embattled by their own domestic politics. It also served as a platform for Ms. Meloni, 47, who has overcome initial qualms about her political roots in a party built on the ashes of fascism to win respect for her steadfast support of Ukraine. Presiding over the two days of meetings, she was able to put a spotlight on several of her pet issues. How to control migration has vexed the United States and Europe, compounded by the effects of climate change and warfare in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Ukraine. It is a particularly delicate issue for Ms. Meloni, who has campaigned hard to fight what she has called “uncontrolled immigration” to Italy and other parts of Europe from Africa and the Middle East. While Europe has welcomed thousands of Ukrainians, especially women and children, fleeing the Russian invasion, Ukrainian officials have urged European countries to help them repatriate men of fighting age. “Turkey is a critical player on global migration,” said Peter Westmacott, who served as Britain’s ambassador to Turkey, France and the United States. He noted that there are about three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds and Afghans. “If Europe wants to control migration from these countries,” Mr. Westmacott said, “Turkey is an indispensable partner.” Mr. Erdogan, he said, could also yet play a role in brokering an end to Ukraine’s war with Russia. As a Black Sea power, Turkey has kept open its commercial and political links to Russia. But it is also a NATO member and has supplied cheap, highly effective drones to help the Ukrainian resistance. Some of the invitations reflected diplomatic protocol, according to Italian officials. Brazil, India and South Africa were automatically included as current or future presidents of the Group of 20 industrialized nations. Argentina was invited, these officials said, because Mr. Milei has recognized the connections and interdependence between East and West. He and Ms. Meloni have also cultivated close personal ties, sharing a right-wing populism that includes opposition to abortion and gay rights.",group country threw open door club friday india brazil turkey nonwestern country acknowledging shifting global landscape tried enlist nation leader cause ranging climate change managing economic competition china diplomat group hammered communiqu pledged support ukraine war russia greater ambition curbing carbon emission focus prime minister narendra modi india president luiz incio lula da silva brazil leader outside g whose support increasingly critical achieving goal among thorny question second day summit migration helped fuel recent resurgence populism farright party europe united state leader also discussed war gaza china state subsidy industry like electric vehicle prompted united state european union impose tariff chinese export prime minister giorgia meloni italy hosting gathering said goal expanded guest list strengthen dialogue nation global south insisted group fortress closed offer value open world m meloni recruited pope francis speak leader danger posed artificial intelligence francis urged regulate technology victim aigenerated fake image clad white puffer jacket jewelencrusted crucifix went viral last year benefit damage cause depend way used pope declared warning risk ai uncontrolled development called lethal autonomous weapon unmanned uncontrolled human hand banned saying machine ever decide whether take life human away pope appearance emotional highlight day carefully staged summitry seemed concede west le dominant demographically economically past listening call equity balance global decisionmaking m meloni guided pope wheelchair around circular table meet leader greeted visibly moved president biden got enthusiastic hug argentina flamboyant president javier milei whose election last november viewed another sign rising tide populism across america europe first time nonwestern leader invited group meeting rarely conspicuous part reflects issue m meloni highlighted africa mediterranean leader algeria kenya tunisia hand luxury resort hotel italy southern coast president recep tayyip erdogan turkey inviting key developing country leader reflects reality confronting china russia requires cooperation g said daniel price top trade adviser president george w bush brazil india turkey concerned chinese predatory trade practice overcapacity japan europe u final g communiqu voiced concern leader called china persistent industrial targeting comprehensive nonmarket policy practice leading global spillover market distortion harmful overcapacity communiqu endorsed mr bidens effort broker ceasefire israel hamas gaza france canada pushed stronger language israel conduct war according people familiar negotiation united state germany resisted victory m meloni conservative opposes abortion communiqu include explicit reference abortion passage pledged promote comprehensive sexual reproductive health right communiqu released group leader last summit hiroshima japan referred specifically abortion right issue injected briefly discordant note gathering president emmanuel macron france told italian journalist politician share france vision equality woman men m meloni criticized mr macron recently called snap parliamentary election seeking politicize issue precious forum like g part however meeting underscored harmony among leader many embattled domestic politics also served platform m meloni overcome initial qualm political root party built ash fascism win respect steadfast support ukraine presiding two day meeting able put spotlight several pet issue control migration vexed united state europe compounded effect climate change warfare afghanistan middle east ukraine particularly delicate issue m meloni campaigned hard fight called uncontrolled immigration italy part europe africa middle east europe welcomed thousand ukrainian especially woman child fleeing russian invasion ukrainian official urged european country help repatriate men fighting age turkey critical player global migration said peter westmacott served britain ambassador turkey france united state noted three million syrian refugee turkey well hundred thousand iraqi kurd afghan europe want control migration country mr westmacott said turkey indispensable partner mr erdogan said could also yet play role brokering end ukraine war russia black sea power turkey kept open commercial political link russia also nato member supplied cheap highly effective drone help ukrainian resistance invitation reflected diplomatic protocol according italian official brazil india south africa automatically included current future president group industrialized nation argentina invited official said mr milei recognized connection interdependence east west m meloni also cultivated close personal tie sharing rightwing populism includes opposition abortion gay right
nytimes,Fire in Kuwait Worker Housing Leaves at Least 49 Dead,"June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/world/middleeast/fire-kuwait-migrant-worker-housing.html,"At least 49 people were killed and dozens of others injured in the Persian Gulf country of Kuwait, the state news agency said, when a fire broke out on Wednesday in a building that housed scores of low-income workers, many of them Indian nationals. The fire began during the morning in a coastal area called Mangaf, about half an hour’s drive from the center of the capital, Kuwait City. The Kuwaiti authorities have held the building owner for questioning as they investigate the cause of the fire and try to determine whether “any shortcoming or neglect” played a role, the state news agency reported. The authorities promised to begin a campaign to tackle building code violations. The public prosecutor’s office also planned to inspect the site and interview survivors. Speaking to journalists at the site of the fire, Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Al Sabah — Kuwait’s deputy prime minister and interior minister — blamed “the greed of property owners” for the disaster and said that the owner of the company employing the workers would also be detained, the Reuters news agency and Kuwaiti newspapers reported. Jayashankar, an Indian salesman who survived the fire, said that he awoke to screams around 4 a.m. local time. He and his roommates opened the door to their fourth-floor apartment and found that thick black smoke had enveloped the corridor, burning their lungs, he said in a phone interview, asking to be identified by his first name only for fear of retribution. Instead of trying to escape, he said, they locked the door, opened a window and waited for help. Two of his roommates who left the apartment to find an exit later died, he said. Witnesses told local news outlets that the fire had begun at the bottom of the seven-story building, sending smoke billowing upward. In a televised interview, an official in Kuwait’s firefighting force, Col. Sayed Hassan Al-Moussawi, said, “In a building like this, you’re supposed to go up to the roof, but unfortunately the door to the roof was locked.” Ramesh, an Indian worker who lives in a building next door and who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said in an interview that he saw people trying to jump out of windows to escape. The fire’s high death toll highlighted the perils faced by low-income immigrants to Gulf countries, who often toil under exploitative contracts and live in overcrowded housing, with regulatory protections that are limited or poorly enforced. Foreigners make up about two-thirds of the population of Kuwait, an oil-rich nation with one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds. Many are low-paid workers from South Asian countries who perform jobs including construction, restaurant service and street cleaning. More than 50 people hurt during the fire were sent to hospitals around Kuwait, with injuries including burns, broken bones from jumping out of the building and carbon monoxide poisoning from smoke inhalation, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. Nine were in critical condition, it said. Many of the workers affected were from India, the country’s embassy in Kuwait said on social media. On Wednesday, India’s ambassador to Kuwait, Adarsh Swaika, visited several hospitals where workers were taken, the embassy said in its posts. In a post on X, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India said that the fire was “saddening” and that the Indian Embassy would monitor the situation closely and work with the authorities “to assist the affected.” In a video published by the Kuwaiti news media, Sheikh Fahad was shown at the location of the fire, questioning an unidentified man about who lived in the building. The man told him that 196 people had lived there. The video cut off after Sheikh Fahad told the authorities to detain the man for questioning. Officials working in the municipality overseeing the area were also suspended from work pending an investigation, Kuwait’s state news agency reported. Building codes in Gulf countries are often laxly put in place, and smoke detectors and fire escapes are not common in residential properties. At the site of the fire on Wednesday afternoon, municipal employees were already putting up notices of violations on nearby buildings, including for partitioning rooms with gypsum board. Mangaf is predominantly inhabited by migrant workers, with apartment blocks housing men from India, Bangladesh and Egypt. Interviewed by The New York Times near the fire location, workers who lived nearby gave varying accounts of the numbers of men typically housed in each room, ranging from three to 12. Jayashankar, the survivor, said that nine people, all Indians, had shared his three-bedroom apartment. The building bore a sign saying it was a workers’ camp for a company called NBTC Group, a contracting firm headquartered in Kuwait with business in construction, industry, logistics and related fields. Phone calls to the company on Wednesday went unanswered, and an employee at the company’s offices said that staff members had been detained by officials that day. Another Indian worker who lived on the second floor of the building said that he and his roommates had survived because they had been out working an overnight shift. The worker, Sami, 45, who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said he had not yet been able to go inside to retrieve his belongings and inspect the damage because the police had closed off entrances to the building. Shahrukh Kha, who is from Bihar, India, said that he had spent all day trying to reach his brother, Kalu, who lived in the building, but that his brother’s phone was off. “We have not gotten any kind of information about whether he is injured or dead,” he said in a phone interview. Kalu Kha, a 30-year-old salesman who works in a fruit and vegetable shop, had been planning to travel home to India next month, his brother said; his wedding date is set for July 22.",least people killed dozen others injured persian gulf country kuwait state news agency said fire broke wednesday building housed score lowincome worker many indian national fire began morning coastal area called mangaf half hour drive center capital kuwait city kuwaiti authority held building owner questioning investigate cause fire try determine whether shortcoming neglect played role state news agency reported authority promised begin campaign tackle building code violation public prosecutor office also planned inspect site interview survivor speaking journalist site fire sheikh fahad yusuf al sabah kuwait deputy prime minister interior minister blamed greed property owner disaster said owner company employing worker would also detained reuters news agency kuwaiti newspaper reported jayashankar indian salesman survived fire said awoke scream around local time roommate opened door fourthfloor apartment found thick black smoke enveloped corridor burning lung said phone interview asking identified first name fear retribution instead trying escape said locked door opened window waited help two roommate left apartment find exit later died said witness told local news outlet fire begun bottom sevenstory building sending smoke billowing upward televised interview official kuwait firefighting force col sayed hassan almoussawi said building like youre supposed go roof unfortunately door roof locked ramesh indian worker life building next door also asked identified first name fear retribution said interview saw people trying jump window escape fire high death toll highlighted peril faced lowincome immigrant gulf country often toil exploitative contract live overcrowded housing regulatory protection limited poorly enforced foreigner make twothirds population kuwait oilrich nation one world largest sovereign wealth fund many lowpaid worker south asian country perform job including construction restaurant service street cleaning people hurt fire sent hospital around kuwait injury including burn broken bone jumping building carbon monoxide poisoning smoke inhalation ministry health said statement nine critical condition said many worker affected india country embassy kuwait said social medium wednesday india ambassador kuwait adarsh swaika visited several hospital worker taken embassy said post post x prime minister narendra modi india said fire saddening indian embassy would monitor situation closely work authority assist affected video published kuwaiti news medium sheikh fahad shown location fire questioning unidentified man lived building man told people lived video cut sheikh fahad told authority detain man questioning official working municipality overseeing area also suspended work pending investigation kuwait state news agency reported building code gulf country often laxly put place smoke detector fire escape common residential property site fire wednesday afternoon municipal employee already putting notice violation nearby building including partitioning room gypsum board mangaf predominantly inhabited migrant worker apartment block housing men india bangladesh egypt interviewed new york time near fire location worker lived nearby gave varying account number men typically housed room ranging three jayashankar survivor said nine people indian shared threebedroom apartment building bore sign saying worker camp company called nbtc group contracting firm headquartered kuwait business construction industry logistics related field phone call company wednesday went unanswered employee company office said staff member detained official day another indian worker lived second floor building said roommate survived working overnight shift worker sami also asked identified first name fear retribution said yet able go inside retrieve belonging inspect damage police closed entrance building shahrukh kha bihar india said spent day trying reach brother kalu lived building brother phone gotten kind information whether injured dead said phone interview kalu kha yearold salesman work fruit vegetable shop planning travel home india next month brother said wedding date set july
nytimes,"At the Ambani Wedding Celebrations, a Dazzling Display of Jewels","June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/fashion/weddings/ambani-jewels.html,"When Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India abruptly changed her country’s constitution in 1971 and abolished the Privy Purse, a government allowance for the country’s former princely rulers, she also moved to nationalize their storied treasuries. Among the maharajahs, nizams and nabobs that once ruled the subcontinent, this set off a frenzy as they scurried to bury the family jewels. For centuries, the rarity, scale and grandeur of Indian jewels was so great that many became iconic objects. Take the Patiala Necklace, a tiered ornament resembling draperies of gems. Designed by Cartier, it featured an astounding 2,930 diamonds and centered on a single rock the size of a walnut. Or consider the Indore Pears, two stupendous and closely matched diamonds owned by Maharajah Yeshwant Rao Holkar II, a glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom was in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Indian princely patronage long set a global standard of splendor for both artistry and ostentation in the jewel trade. Yet in the decades after the Privy Purse, most of the big rocks seemed to have vanished underground. Legend has it that members of formerly royal families stashed their jewels in Swiss vaults, pawned them on the black market or hid them in flower pots. Bling on a royal scale largely disappeared. Or so it seemed until a fresh cadre of princes heaved into view: oligarchs. The richest of these by orders of magnitude is Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of his family’s megacompany Reliance Industries. Mr. Ambani’s personal fortune is estimated by Forbes at a staggering $115 billion. Despite his vast wealth, few outside India had heard of him — that is, until March 1, when he hosted a three-day party to celebrate his son Anant’s wedding in July. Everything about the prewedding affair was on a princely scale: the guest list of 1,000, including boldface names like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump; a glass palace specially constructed in the Ambani’s hometown, Jamnagar, in the western state of Gujarat; and Rihanna’s first public performance in years. Rihanna’s reported $6 million payday hogged the headlines, but what lit up at least one obsessive corner of the internet was the Ambani jewelry. This included necklaces and earrings and rings and hair ornaments of a size and grandeur seldom seen publicly since the days of the Raj. “It was almost like the time of maharajahs 100 years down the line,” said Pramod Kumar, an archivist and a founder of the museum consultancy EKA. He is also keeper of topophilia.india, an erudite Instagram account that is catnip for Indophile aesthetes. Mr. Kumar’s sleuth work traced a possible source of the two most gobsmacking gems seen at the Ambani prewedding celebration: massive step-cut Colombian emeralds roughly the size of Popsicles. Draped one below the other as pendants to a diamond necklace, they were worn one evening by the bridegroom’s mother, Nita Ambani. The bigger one was “of 562 carats,” Mr. Kumar wrote in an Instagram post, adding that the weight of the smaller stone was a mere 303 carats. Whatever their source, those emeralds were just two among many gems on display throughout an event at which the jewels often had greater star power than their wearers. “That emerald necklace was what caught everyone’s attention at first, but it was all almost unfathomable,” said Stellene Volandes, the editor in chief of Town & Country. She noted the scarcity represented by ropes of the rarest natural pearls from the Arabian Sea; necklaces in the heavy, ornate rani haar style studded with diamonds; and headpieces known as maang tikka, made with deep green emeralds from the storied Muzo mines. “You’d be very hard-pressed to find comparables for the sheer size and horsepower” of the jewels at the Ambani prewedding party, said Nico Landrigan, the president of the Verdura jewelry house in New York. “The Indians are a jewelry-obsessed culture in a category all their own. So you can only imagine what the actual wedding will bring out.” Before the wedding, scheduled for July 12 to 14 in Mumbai, there was yet another lavish preparatory celebration and opportunity to flaunt big rocks — a cruise from the Tyrrhenian Sea in Palermo, Italy, to the Mediterranean in Cannes, France, on an ocean liner whose 2,400 staterooms had been retrofitted for the Ambanis as three-bedroom suites for 800 invited guests. “Basically, what the Ambanis are doing is displaying a kind of old-style Hollywood glam,” said Mr. Kumar of EKA. “You don’t see that with any other current billionaire moguls in Europe or America, at least not in the public realm.” For Daniela Mascetti, the former chairwoman of Sotheby’s jewelry division in Europe and an author of “Understanding Jewelry,” a bible of the trade, the group more aptly compared to the Ambanis is the robber barons of the Industrial Age. “You have to look back to Vanderbilt or Gould, who also wanted big door-stoppers,” Ms. Mascetti said from London. “Let’s put it in a nice way,” she added. “If you are new money and you want to display wealth, you go big.” Yet it is not altogether that simple. Certain Ambani jewels were crafted using the whopper stones, but that is not to suggest that the determining factor in commissioning them was size. “There is tremendous artistry in the work,” said Ms. Volandes of Town & Country. Much of the Ambani jewels were designed by Viren Bhagat, among the more refined high jewelers, though also an assiduously private one. More than the size of individual stones like the stepped-cut emeralds, few save a detective like Mr. Kumar could predict their origins. “Being one-off is of the greatest importance in that world,” Francesca Amfitheatrof, the creative director of high jewelry and watches at Louis Vuitton, said recently from St.-Tropez, France, where she was debuting her latest collection. “To be able to source things that are so unique and outstanding, honestly, only an emperor has that possibility anymore,” she said. “It’s completely maharajah-like. It’s imperial.”",prime minister indira gandhi india abruptly changed country constitution abolished privy purse government allowance country former princely ruler also moved nationalize storied treasury among maharajah nizams nabob ruled subcontinent set frenzy scurried bury family jewel century rarity scale grandeur indian jewel great many became iconic object take patiala necklace tiered ornament resembling drapery gem designed cartier featured astounding diamond centered single rock size walnut consider indore pear two stupendous closely matched diamond owned maharajah yeshwant rao holkar ii glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom central indian state madhya pradesh indian princely patronage long set global standard splendor artistry ostentation jewel trade yet decade privy purse big rock seemed vanished underground legend member formerly royal family stashed jewel swiss vault pawned black market hid flower pot bling royal scale largely disappeared seemed fresh cadre prince heaved view oligarch richest order magnitude mukesh ambani chairman family megacompany reliance industry mr ambanis personal fortune estimated forbes staggering billion despite vast wealth outside india heard march hosted threeday party celebrate son anants wedding july everything prewedding affair princely scale guest list including boldface name like mark zuckerberg bill gate ivanka trump glass palace specially constructed ambanis hometown jamnagar western state gujarat rihannas first public performance year rihannas reported million payday hogged headline lit least one obsessive corner internet ambani jewelry included necklace earring ring hair ornament size grandeur seldom seen publicly since day raj almost like time maharajah year line said pramod kumar archivist founder museum consultancy eka also keeper topophiliaindia erudite instagram account catnip indophile aesthete mr kumars sleuth work traced possible source two gobsmacking gem seen ambani prewedding celebration massive stepcut colombian emerald roughly size popsicle draped one pendant diamond necklace worn one evening bridegroom mother nita ambani bigger one carat mr kumar wrote instagram post adding weight smaller stone mere carat whatever source emerald two among many gem display throughout event jewel often greater star power wearer emerald necklace caught everyones attention first almost unfathomable said stellene volandes editor chief town country noted scarcity represented rope rarest natural pearl arabian sea necklace heavy ornate rani haar style studded diamond headpiece known maang tikka made deep green emerald storied muzo mine youd hardpressed find comparables sheer size horsepower jewel ambani prewedding party said nico landrigan president verdura jewelry house new york indian jewelryobsessed culture category imagine actual wedding bring wedding scheduled july mumbai yet another lavish preparatory celebration opportunity flaunt big rock cruise tyrrhenian sea palermo italy mediterranean cannes france ocean liner whose stateroom retrofitted ambanis threebedroom suite invited guest basically ambanis displaying kind oldstyle hollywood glam said mr kumar eka dont see current billionaire mogul europe america least public realm daniela mascetti former chairwoman sothebys jewelry division europe author understanding jewelry bible trade group aptly compared ambanis robber baron industrial age look back vanderbilt gould also wanted big doorstopper m mascetti said london let put nice way added new money want display wealth go big yet altogether simple certain ambani jewel crafted using whopper stone suggest determining factor commissioning size tremendous artistry work said m volandes town country much ambani jewel designed viren bhagat among refined high jeweler though also assiduously private one size individual stone like steppedcut emerald save detective like mr kumar could predict origin oneoff greatest importance world francesca amfitheatrof creative director high jewelry watch louis vuitton said recently sttropez france debuting latest collection able source thing unique outstanding honestly emperor possibility anymore said completely maharajahlike imperial

On Sunday, that space was transformed into a stage for one of the most-watched global sporting events of the year. More than 34,000 fans and cricket dignitaries squeezed into a temporary stadium built in the last three months in the Long Island park to watch the most anticipated match of the T20 Cricket World Cup: India versus Pakistan. For about three hours, fans in blue and orange India shirts mingled with their (vastly outnumbered) rivals in the dark green of Pakistan, producing a festive and vibrant atmosphere. They roared at every big play, shouting and waving signs and flags. They ate South Asian food sold at the concession stands, jumped, chanted, high-fived with fellow supporters and — after a bit of rain — soaked up the sunshine on a historic day at the usually quiet park. “It was electric,” said Chandu Talla, an India fan and entrepreneur from Tampa, Fla., who came to the match with his son Aryan, a high school junior. “We paid $2,500 per ticket and no regrets,” he added. “It was a dream come true to see India here.” After a slow start, India came back strong to win, and when Pakistan’s Naseem Shah hit the last ball from India bowler Arshdeep Singh, the India fans erupted in cheers. “It was pretty good,” said India bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who was named the player of the match. “Always, when India and Pakistan play, a lot of emotion does come in. It did feel like we had a lot of support.” People in the New York area may have been mostly oblivious to it, but any match between India and Pakistan, two of the greatest cricketing nations, is a monumental event, at least in South Asia and other cricket-loving parts of the world. The previous time the teams played, last fall, viewership reached 398 million in India alone, according to the International Cricket Council. (This year’s Super Bowl had 123 million viewers.) Sunday’s attendance (34,028) constituted the largest at an international cricket match in the United States, according to the I.C.C. Attendees included such cricketing legends as Yuvraj Singh of India, Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi and Australia’s Ricky Ponting. For Omar Minaya, the Yankees’ special adviser and the former general manager of the Mets, the cricket match was his first. “It’s amazing,” he said. “The atmosphere is great. It’s like the World Baseball Classic, or the Dominican Baseball League.” The T20 World Cup, held every two years, is a 20-nation tournament featuring a shorter form of cricket. This year, for the first time, the event is being held in the United States and several Caribbean nations where cricket is revered. The U.S. matches are also being held in Dallas and Lauderhill, Fla., but New York was designated for the marquee matchup. Cricket is part of the cultural fabric in both India and Pakistan, but political tensions over the decades have forced the countries to play each other in other places. “Oh, it’s contentious, a real battle of sentiments,” said Narinder Kapoor, 84, a retired U.S. Treasury Department agent, originally from New Delhi. “When these countries play, it’s a real hot potato.” A former amateur cricket player who emigrated to Syosset, N.Y., in 1972, Mr. Kapoor had not seen a cricket match live since 1974, although he watches the sport constantly on TV. He went to the game between Ireland and Canada on Friday and had hoped to attend Sunday’s big encounter, but his knees were ailing him, so he stayed home, according to his son, Sandeep Kapoor. The elder Mr. Kapoor said that he enjoyed the sparsely attended match on Friday, but added that the temporary stadium did not have enough accommodations for people with disabilities and that it was difficult for older people to ascend the steps. “But once you are inside, the field and the view is excellent,” he said. “World class.” Security was tight for the match, especially after a website purportedly affiliated with the terrorist organization ISIS called for attacks on the event. Mounted police, SWAT units, sniffer dogs, helicopters and large numbers of police officers swarmed the area, and long lines formed at entrances as people went through security scanners. Bruce Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, said that the I.C.C. had defrayed some of the cost of the security, which he said included local, state and federal agencies, including the F.B.I. “I want to commend the fans,” Mr. Blakeman said, adding, “Everybody has been so polite and respectful, and they followed instructions so they could be safe and healthy.” There was at least one exception. An airplane trailing a sign that said “Release Imran Khan” breached restricted airspace over the stadium before the match. (Mr. Khan, a former Pakistani cricket star and former prime minister of Pakistan, is serving a prison sentence there.) Mr. Blakeman said the plane was eventually intercepted. The mood at the park was generally upbeat, even for Pakistan fans on the losing end. “India-Pakistan is a very big deal,” said Temu Martin, an airfreight transport official from New Jersey and a Pakistan supporter. “But it’s not war. It’s a game.” He said that after Pakistan lost to the United States last week in a major upset in Dallas, ticket prices for Sunday’s match in East Meadow plummeted from over $2,000 to $600. He said he was planning to travel to Barbados for Pakistan’s next match and then to attend a knockout-stage match in Antigua. There are three more matches scheduled in New York, with the final one on Wednesday between India and the United States. The stadium will then be dismantled and the pieces sent out to other sporting events around the country. Mr. Blakeman predicted that Nassau County would make $150 million on the eight New York games of the tournament — 10 times what the county spent on infrastructure, planning and security, he said. Cricket officials had told him that there could be as many as 600 million viewers worldwide for Sunday’s match, he added. He said that he had heard from investors who want to bring the sport, perhaps with New York’s franchise in Major League Cricket, to Nassau County. “The way things have gone here these last couple of weeks, I think cricket has found a home,” Mr. Blakeman said.",normally time year grassy southeastern corner eisenhower park east meadow ny place softball game family picnic cricket player enjoying warm weekend afternoon sunday space transformed stage one mostwatched global sporting event year fan cricket dignitary squeezed temporary stadium built last three month long island park watch anticipated match cricket world cup india versus pakistan three hour fan blue orange india shirt mingled vastly outnumbered rival dark green pakistan producing festive vibrant atmosphere roared every big play shouting waving sign flag ate south asian food sold concession stand jumped chanted highfived fellow supporter bit rain soaked sunshine historic day usually quiet park electric said chandu talla india fan entrepreneur tampa fla came match son aryan high school junior paid per ticket regret added dream come true see india slow start india came back strong win pakistan naseem shah hit last ball india bowler arshdeep singh india fan erupted cheer pretty good said india bowler jasprit bumrah named player match always india pakistan play lot emotion come feel like lot support people new york area may mostly oblivious match india pakistan two greatest cricketing nation monumental event least south asia cricketloving part world previous time team played last fall viewership reached million india alone according international cricket council year super bowl million viewer sunday attendance constituted largest international cricket match united state according icc attendee included cricketing legend yuvraj singh india pakistan shahid afridi australia ricky ponting omar minaya yankee special adviser former general manager mets cricket match first amazing said atmosphere great like world baseball classic dominican baseball league world cup held every two year nation tournament featuring shorter form cricket year first time event held united state several caribbean nation cricket revered u match also held dallas lauderhill fla new york designated marquee matchup cricket part cultural fabric india pakistan political tension decade forced country play place oh contentious real battle sentiment said narinder kapoor retired u treasury department agent originally new delhi country play real hot potato former amateur cricket player emigrated syosset ny mr kapoor seen cricket match live since although watch sport constantly tv went game ireland canada friday hoped attend sunday big encounter knee ailing stayed home according son sandeep kapoor elder mr kapoor said enjoyed sparsely attended match friday added temporary stadium enough accommodation people disability difficult older people ascend step inside field view excellent said world class security tight match especially website purportedly affiliated terrorist organization isi called attack event mounted police swat unit sniffer dog helicopter large number police officer swarmed area long line formed entrance people went security scanner bruce blakeman nassau county executive said icc defrayed cost security said included local state federal agency including fbi want commend fan mr blakeman said adding everybody polite respectful followed instruction could safe healthy least one exception airplane trailing sign said release imran khan breached restricted airspace stadium match mr khan former pakistani cricket star former prime minister pakistan serving prison sentence mr blakeman said plane eventually intercepted mood park generally upbeat even pakistan fan losing end indiapakistan big deal said temu martin airfreight transport official new jersey pakistan supporter war game said pakistan lost united state last week major upset dallas ticket price sunday match east meadow plummeted said planning travel barbados pakistan next match attend knockoutstage match antigua three match scheduled new york final one wednesday india united state stadium dismantled piece sent sporting event around country mr blakeman predicted nassau county would make million eight new york game tournament time county spent infrastructure planning security said cricket official told could many million viewer worldwide sunday match added said heard investor want bring sport perhaps new york franchise major league cricket nassau county way thing gone last couple week think cricket found home mr blakeman said
nytimes,"Modi, Striking a Modest Tone, Is Sworn In for a Third Term","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/world/asia/india-changed-modi-swearing-in.html,"As a humbled Narendra Modi was sworn in on Sunday for a third term as India’s prime minister, the political air in New Delhi appeared transformed. The election that ended last week stripped Mr. Modi of his parliamentary majority and forced him to turn to a diverse set of coalition partners to stay in power. Now, these other parties are enjoying something that for years was singularly Mr. Modi’s: relevance and the spotlight. Their leaders have been swarmed by TV crews while on their way to present demands and policy opinions to Mr. Modi. His opponents, too, have been getting more airtime, with stations cutting live to their news conferences, something almost unheard-of in recent years. Above all, the change can be seen in Mr. Modi himself. For now, at least, the messianic air is gone. He pitches himself as the modest administrator that voters showed they wanted. “To run the government, a majority is necessary. But to run the nation, a consensus is necessary,” Mr. Modi said in a speech on Friday to members of his coalition ahead of his swearing in. “The people want us to deliver better than before.” A visibly emotional Mr. Modi took the oath of office on Sunday evening, only the second prime minister to be elected for a third consecutive term in the seven decades of India’s republic. The ceremony, at the country’s presidential palace, was attended by about 8,000 supporters and dignitaries, including the leaders of India’s neighboring nations. To many, Mr. Modi’s shift in approach can mean only good things for the country’s democracy — a move toward moderation in a hugely diverse nation that was being whipped into a Hindu-first monolith in the image of one man. The question is whether Mr. Modi can truly become something he has not been during his two-plus decades in elected office: a consensus builder. “He is a pragmatic politician and, for his own survival and for the survival of his party, he will be a little mellowed,” said Ashutosh, a New Delhi-based analyst who uses only one name and is the author of a book on how Indian politics have changed under Mr. Modi. “But to assume a qualitative change in his style of governance is expecting too much.” A trademark of Mr. Modi’s leadership in recent years has been the use of power levers at his disposal — from pressure of police cases to the lure of a share in power and its perks — to break his opponents and get them to switch to his side. A bruised governing party may well try such tactics to peel away some lawmakers to his side, analyst say, to buttress his place at the top. But in the days leading up to the swearing-in, a change in approach was evident. When members of the new coalition packed into the hall of India’s old Parliament building on Friday for deliberations on forming the government, every time a senior ally seated next to him stood up to start his speech, Mr. Modi also stood up. When it was time for Mr. Modi to be garlanded as the coalition’s choice for prime minister, he waited for the leaders of the two main coalition partners to arrive by his side before the congratulatory wreath of purple orchids was placed around his neck. His hourlong address contained none of his usual references to himself in the third person. His tone was measured. He focused on the coalition’s promise of “good governance” and “the dream of a developed India,” and he acknowledged that things would be different from the past 10 years. The last time Mr. Modi came to the Parliament complex for a closely watched event, last May when he inaugurated a new, more modern building for the assembly, he made an entrance some observers compared with that of a king: with markings on his forehead as a sign of piety and a scepter in his hand, as shirtless, chanting Hindu monks walked ahead of and behind him. This time, he went straight to a copy of the Constitution, which declares that India is a secular and socialist democracy, bowing before it and lifting it to his forehead. For the first time in his more than two decades in elected office, Mr. Modi finds himself in uncharted territory. Until now, as long as he has been at the helm — whether at the state level as the chief minister of Gujarat or at the national level — his Bharatiya Janata Party has always had a majority. Analysts say that history of never having been in the opposition has shaped his heavy-handed approach to politics. When he left Gujarat, after 13 years, he had established such a firm grip and had so routed the opposition that the state had effectively become one of single-party rule. His first national victory in 2014, with a majority for his B.J.P., ended decades of coalition governance in India, in which no party had been able to capture the 272 seats in Parliament necessary for a majority. In 2019, he was re-elected with an even bigger majority. Mr. Modi’s enormous power helped swiftly carry out what had for decades been his right-wing party’s agenda, including construction of a lavish Hindu temple on a long-disputed site that once held a mosque, and the revocation of the special status long enjoyed by the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir. A separatist insurgency has long troubled the Himalayan Kashmir region. As the inauguration ceremony began in New Delhi on Sunday, a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims in the Reasi district fell into a gorge after gunmen opened fire on it. At least eight people were killed, the police said. A trademark of Mr. Modi’s governance was a disregard for parliamentary procedures and for debates on legislation. His unexpected, overnight demonetization in 2016 — which invalidated India’s currency in an effort to crack down on corruption — threw the country into chaos and dealt a blow to a still cash-driven economy. Similarly, rushing to enact laws aimed at overhauling the agriculture market resulted in a year of protests that choked Delhi, forcing Mr. Modi to retreat. Before the election results came out, Mr. Modi’s party had predicted that his coalition would win 400 seats in India’s 543-seat Parliament. The opposition would be reduced to sitting “in the spectators’ gallery,” Mr. Modi said. Officials in his government had made clear that in his new term he would seek to put in place the only main item remaining on his party’s agenda: legislating a “uniform civil code” across this diverse country to replace varying laws of different religions that currently govern issues like marriage and inheritance. His party leaders spoke of Mr. Modi not only as their leader for the current term, but also for the next election in 2029, when he would be 78. “He has been trying to transform the country,” Sudesh Verma, a B.J.P. official who wrote a book on Mr. Modi’s rise, said in an interview before the election results were announced. “I look forward to him working like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, who worked into his 90s.” But under a coalition government, Mr. Modi’s traditional approach will be difficult. Two of the main coalition parties that helped him achieve the minimum number of Parliament seats to form a government are secular, in contrast to Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist ideology. N. Chandrababu Naidu, whose party holds 16 seats, has been scathing in the past in his criticism of Mr. Modi’s treatment of the Muslim minority. He has also openly criticized Mr. Modi for using the central investigating agencies to target his opponents and taking “steps to subvert all democratic institutions.” Neerja Chowdhury, a political analyst in Delhi and the author of the 2023 book “How Prime Ministers Decide,” said, “The contentious ideological issues, like the enactment of the uniform civil code, may be put on the back burner if the allies are not comfortable with it.” Mr. Modi’s popular image is built on two strong pillars. He is a champion of economic development, with an inspiring biography of a rise from a humble caste and relative poverty. He is also a lifelong Hindu nationalist, with decades as a foot soldier in a movement seeking to turn India’s secular and diverse state into an overtly Hindu-first place. At the peak of his power, the Hindu nationalist aspect increasingly dominated. Analysts say that the recent rebuke by voters might be a lucky break for the nation: prompting Mr. Modi to tap into his development champion side, and to focus on a legacy of economic transformation that could improve the lives of all Indians.",humbled narendra modi sworn sunday third term india prime minister political air new delhi appeared transformed election ended last week stripped mr modi

nytimes,"India’s Modi, Humbled by Voters, Faces Potent Economic Struggles","June 7, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/business/india-election-modi-economy.html,"Before the Indian election results emerged this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was widely viewed as a charismatic and popular strongman celebrated by the business world for elevating its importance, even as he failed to solve a vexing problem: how to turn swift economic growth into critically needed jobs. After the election, Mr. Modi finds himself staring at that same monumental puzzle, yet relegated to an uncomfortable new status. He is the head of a party that has been chastened at the polls, forcing him to forge a coalition to maintain power. Mr. Modi’s governing authority is likely to be constrained by the complexities of keeping his coalition partners on his side. He could not solve India’s most deep-seated economic challenge when he wielded a monopolistic hold on power. Now, he is a weakened leader who must balance additional interests, while still lacking an obvious way to improve living standards. “There has been a sense that employment growth has been weak in the last four, five years,” said Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic adviser to the Modi administration, who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “How do you create more jobs? This is really India’s central economic challenge, but I think the government will find itself with relatively limited tools.” The humbling of Mr. Modi’s party resonates in part as an expression of popular frustration that India remains a land of economic peril for hundreds of millions of people, as well as a country defined by astonishing contrasts in wealth. In major cities, five-star hotels boasting sumptuous spas look down on teeming slums that lack plumbing. In rural areas, malnutrition prevails under many roofs, and families struggle to find the money to keep children in school. Though its working-age population numbers roughly one billion, India has only 430 million jobs, according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, an independent research institution in Mumbai. And most of those counted as employed are stuck in precarious circumstances as day laborers and farm hands, lacking reliable wages and government workplace protections. Improved livelihoods are evident in many cities, from the high-rise apartments filling out the horizons to air-conditioned shopping malls and luxury cars choking roads. But the gains are narrowly concentrated. Professionals who work in technology centers in the south of the country and around the capital of New Delhi have enjoyed substantial progress. A rapidly growing domestic auto industry is a source of relatively high-paying jobs. Magnates like Gautam Adani, one of Asia’s richest men, have seen their business empires enhanced by their relationships with Mr. Modi and his willingness to eviscerate regulatory impediments to their greater fortune. But most Indian workers are effectively marooned in the so-called informal sector — laboring at roadside stalls, in small shops and in itinerant trades where they have no guarantee of income or the possibility of advancement. The failure of economic growth to yield more jobs is in large part the story of how India missed out on the manufacturing boom that played out in East Asia over recent decades. From South Korea and China to Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, hundreds of millions of people have escaped poverty via wages earned in factories. India has not shared in that transformation in large part because of a historical focus on self-sufficiency, a disdain for international trade and stultifying bureaucracy that has discouraged investment. “The whole manufacturing thing bypassed India,” Mr. Subramanian, the economist, said. “It’s that bigger development failure that is continuing to haunt India.” Mr. Modi has pursued initiatives aimed at bolstering manufacturing and increasing exports. His administration has streamlined regulations and improved ports. Yet despite some high-profile developments like Apple moving the assembly of some iPhones to India, manufacturing makes up only 13 percent of the country’s economy, according to World Bank data. That is a lower share than a decade ago, when Mr. Modi took office. Foreign money has flowed into India’s stock markets, multiplying share prices, a key element of Mr. Modi’s pro-business image. But persuading international investors to put money directly into Indian companies — a riskier bet — has been a harder sell. His Hindu nationalist party has demonized the Muslim minority, a source of social ferment that has raised fears of instability. The election could further discourage additional investment, because Mr. Modi will likely have a more difficult time gaining passage of stalled reforms sought by business, including laws making it easier to amass land and hire and fire workers. With no clear pathway toward economic dynamism and more challenging political circumstances, Mr. Modi might resort to a time-honored method of shoring up support: He will expand social welfare programs, tapping government coffers to hand out more cash to communities in need. Such a course could potentially diminish available funding for the advancement of the government’s signature program — its aggressive construction of highways, ports, airports and other infrastructure. Those plans are central to maintaining India’s strong economic growth and the broader campaign to encourage investment in manufacturing. Some fear that any short-term pursuit of political favor through the scattering of money could undermine the longer-term project of spurring jobs through the promotion of industry. “You need to ensure that the benefits of economic development reach the maximum number of people,” said Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at Global Data.TS Lombard, a forecasting and consulting firm in London. “If people keep depending on welfare and are not getting the benefits of economic development, then it basically just creates stagnation.” Geopolitical alterations appear to give India a fresh crack at growing its manufacturing base. As the United States and China engage in trade hostilities, multinational brands are seeking to reduce their heavy dependence on Chinese factories to make their goods. Major retailers like Walmart are increasingly looking to India as an alternative to China. But capturing that potential investment demands continued upgrading of highways, rail connections and ports, along with a focus on vocational training to give people the needed skills to take up factory work. Even before the election, there were doubts that Mr. Modi’s administration was moving quickly enough to realize these gains. “India is a counterweight to China in terms of geopolitics, and we will continue to see some of that investment flowing,” Ms. Deveshwar said. “But the scale at which they are provisioning the ecosystem for these opportunities just is not large enough.”",indian election

nytimes,The World Heads to the Polls,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/climate/global-elections-climate-change-policy.html,"One of the busiest election cycles in history is coming to an end on Sunday. Hundreds of millions of people have gone to the polls in South Africa, India and Mexico in recent days, and millions more will do the same in the European Union this weekend. As Somini Sengupta has explained in a series of articles this week, among the issues that the new leaders of these countries will face: how to transition away from coal, how to adapt to record-breaking heat and, in Europe’s case, how to address a growing backlash against environmental policies. Today, I want to lay out some the most pressing environmental challenges in these areas, and what the results announced in the past few days point to. Keep in mind that whatever happens in the United States election in November will affect many of these countries, too. The biggest takeaway from India’s elections, as my colleagues who cover the country put it, is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “lost his aura of invincibility.” His Bharatiya Janata Party still won far more seats than any other party, and Modi is set to take up his third consecutive term as prime minister. But his party didn’t win an outright majority and now needs coalition partners to stay in power. Many critics of the current government see the result as good news for democracy, because Modi will be forced to seek support from more moderate allies. It could also bring some relief to activists like Ritwick Dutta, an environmental lawyer whose efforts to defend nature in India have made him a target of the government. But it’s unclear how fewer seats in Parliament will affect Modi’s environmental policies. The main challenges facing the next Indian government are what to do about the effects of climate change, including heat waves that have killed dozens of people. During the elections, at least 33 poll workers were among them, and the heat also closed schools in several states,",one busiest election cycle history coming end sunday hundred million people gone poll south africa india mexico recent day million european union weekend somini sengupta explained series article week among issue new leader country face transition away coal adapt recordbreaking heat europe case address growing backlash environmental policy today want lay pressing environmental challenge area result announced past day point keep mind whatever happens united state election november affect many country biggest takeaway india election colleague cover country put prime minister narendra modi lost aura invincibility bharatiya janata party still far seat party modi set take third consecutive term prime minister party didnt win outright majority need coalition partner stay power many critic current government see result good news democracy modi forced seek support moderate ally could also bring relief activist like ritwick dutta environmental lawyer whose effort defend nature india made target government unclear fewer seat parliament affect modis environmental policy main challenge facing next indian government effect climate change including heat wave killed dozen people election least poll worker among heat also closed school several state
nytimes,Narendra Modi’s India,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/briefing/modis-india.html,"Narendra Modi has just won re-election as India’s prime minister, though by a far narrower margin than expected. With his third consecutive term, the charismatic strongman has still sealed his position as the country’s most significant leader in generations. Despite having led India for a decade, Modi has in some ways kept his country guessing about his vision. On major issues — India’s relationships, its economy, its society and its government — it’s still unclear what sort of country Modi wants India to be. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain four of the big questions. India has spent recent years deepening its relationship with the United States. It has gotten closer to American allies, including Japan and Australia, and ordered high-end American weapons systems — the kind that create dependence down the road. And it is unlikely to side with China. In 2020, Chinese troops crossed into territory controlled by India and killed 20 soldiers in a skirmish. Modi has kept Beijing at arm’s length since then. But Modi, 73, has signaled that he doesn’t want to be a U.S. ally. Some officials in his inner circle still regard the United States warily. American diplomats complain about New Delhi’s apparent efforts to erode democratic norms and the rights of minority groups. So India keeps its options open. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States tried in vain to persuade India to take a stand against the war. India still processes Russian oil (picking up the slack created by international sanctions). It still buys weapons from Russia. India spent the Cold War trying to position itself as a nonaligned power. Old habits die hard. India recently overtook China as the most populous country and the fastest-growing large economy. Still, most of the country remains poor. Some 800 million people need help filling their stomachs. Modi’s ideas about how to help them can be contradictory — they’re both globally minded and protectionist.",narendra modi reelection india prime minister though far narrower margin expected third consecutive term charismatic strongman still sealed position country significant leader generation despite led india decade modi way kept country guessing vision major issue india relationship economy society government still unclear sort country modi want india today newsletter ill explain four big question india spent recent year deepening relationship united state gotten closer american ally including japan australia ordered highend american weapon system kind create dependence road unlikely side china chinese troop crossed territory controlled india killed soldier skirmish modi kept beijing arm length since modi signaled doesnt want u ally official inner circle still regard united state warily american diplomat complain new delhi apparent effort erode democratic norm right minority group india keep option open russia invaded ukraine united state tried vain persuade india take stand war india still process russian oil picking slack created international sanction still buy weapon russia india spent cold war trying position nonaligned power old habit die hard india recently overtook china populous country fastestgrowing large economy still country remains poor million people need help filling stomach modis idea help contradictory theyre globally minded protectionist
nytimes,"In Global Elections, Strongmen Are Taken Down a Notch","June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/world/global-elections-india-turkey-democracy.html,"In India, a powerful leader wins another term but sees his party’s majority vanish. In South Africa, the governing party is humbled by voters for the first time since the end of apartheid. In Britain, a populist insurgent barges into an election that is shaping up to be a crushing defeat for the long-ruling Conservatives. If there is a common thread halfway through this global year of elections, it is a desire by voters to send a strong signal to the powers that be — if not quite a wholesale housecleaning, then a defiant shake-up of the status quo. Even in Mexico, where Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and the handpicked successor of the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was elected in a landslide last Sunday, voters were rewarding the forces that had uprooted the country’s entrenched establishment only six years earlier. With a billion-plus people going to the polls in more than 60 countries, some analysts had feared that 2024 would pose a fateful test for democracy — one that it might fail. For years, populist and strongmen leaders have chipped away at democratic institutions, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of elections, while social media has swamped voters with disinformation and conspiracy theories. In some of the biggest, most fragile democracies, leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey had been regarded as close to invincible, using appeals to nationalism or sectarianism to mobilize supporters and bending institutions to suit their purposes. Yet now, Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan have both had their wings clipped. Soaring inflation, chronic unemployment and uneven economic growth have widened inequality in India, Turkey and elsewhere, frustrating voters who have shown a willingness to buck the establishment. “We do have electoral systems that are producing outcomes the governing parties didn’t want,” said Ben Ansell, a professor of comparative democratic institutions at the University of Oxford. “They’ve all been destabilized by a tricky economic environment, and behaving like strongmen hasn’t saved them.” Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan remain in power, each now in his third term. But Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., lost dozens of seats and will have to govern in a coalition with two secular parties. Turkey’s opposition struck a blow against Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party in April, winning a string of local elections and solidifying its control of important cities like Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. “In a lot of countries where there’s been talk of backsliding, that’s where we’ve seen a bounce back,” Professor Ansell said. “For Modi and Erdogan, taking the sheen off their infallibility was very important.” With so many elections in so many countries, it is dangerous to generalize. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia rolled up 88 percent of the vote in a landslide re-election victory in March that spoke less to Russian public sentiment and more to the ability of an autocrat, facing no meaningful opposition, to stage-manage a show of support for his war in Ukraine. In Europe, far-right parties are expected to perform well in European Parliament elections, which began on Thursday. Analysts said they did not believe this would jeopardize the political center that has governed Europe in the post-World War II era. And Poland provided a source of reassurance last fall, when voters pushed out its nationalist Law and Justice Party in favor of a more liberal opposition. Still, the success of far-right figures like Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy, attests to the enduring appeal of populism. “Populists and right-wingers will continue to make gains and strike fear into the European political establishment,” the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said in its analysis of the top risks of 2024. Britain’s general election was shaken up on Monday when Nigel Farage, a populist politician, pro-Brexit campaigner and ally of former President Donald J. Trump, announced he would run for a seat in Parliament under the banner of his Reform U.K. party, which has a strident anti-immigration message. That will add to the headache for the Conservative Party, which has lagged the opposition Labour Party by double digits in polls for nearly 18 months. Reform, which is fielding candidates across the country, could siphon off Conservative votes among those who blame the party for a weak economy and rising immigration numbers since Britain left the European Union in 2020. Some critics argue that the Conservative Party’s problems stem from its free-market policies, which they say have disillusioned voters in disadvantaged parts of Britain and set it apart from right-wing parties in Europe or Mr. Trump’s Make America Great Again movement in the United States. More fundamentally, though, the Conservatives have been in power for 14 years, and they face the same pent-up dissatisfaction with the status quo that fueled the recent elections in India, South Africa and Turkey. In some countries, the urge to break with the past has led voters to make unorthodox choices: Javier Milei, a flamboyant libertarian economist, swept to power in Argentina last November with a promise to close its central bank and wage an all-out assault on what he described as a corrupt political “caste.” Some analysts argue that similarly disruptive forces are driving the presidential race in the United States, where a comparatively healthy economy and the advantages of incumbency have not spared President Biden, who faces a neck-and-neck challenge from Mr. Trump even after the former president was convicted of multiple felonies. “It’s not about left versus right, it’s about the status quo versus change,” said Frank Luntz, an American political strategist who has lived and worked in Britain. “You can’t buy a house in the U.K., the N.H.S. doesn’t work,” he said, referring to the National Health Service. “In the United States, you can’t afford housing or health care. It’s about broken promises, year after year after year.” That sense of betrayal is even more acute in countries like South Africa, where the African National Congress, or A.N.C., has governed since the start of democracy there in 1994, piling up majorities even as the economy and social infrastructure crumbled. Last week, voters finally rebelled, driving down the A.N.C.’s vote share to 40 percent, from 58 percent in the last national election in 2019. Among their biggest complaints is the lack of job opportunities: South Africa’s unemployment rate — at 42 percent, including those who have stopped looking for work — is one of the highest in the world. Stagnation has widened the country’s already profound inequality. South Africans flock to cities looking for work. But many end up in decrepit buildings and slapdash shack communities, often without running water or sanitary toilets. Regular power outages leave streets dark and residents of many communities vulnerable to crime. South Africa’s murder rate is six and a half times as high as that of the United States and 45 times as high as Germany’s. Jacob Zuma, the scandal-scarred former president, has benefited from this misery, helping start a new party, umKhonto weSizwe, or M.K., which won nearly 15 percent of the vote, mostly at the expense of his former party, the A.N.C. Mr. Zuma attracts a feverish following among disillusioned A.N.C. supporters, who accuse the party of selling out to wealthy white businesspeople and not moving aggressively enough to redistribute wealth to the Black majority after apartheid. India’s election was a comparable anti-incumbent revolt, even if Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. is still the largest party in Parliament by a wide margin. The party’s campaign spending was at least 20 times as much as that of its main opposition, the Congress Party, which had its bank accounts frozen by the government in a tax dispute on the eve of the election. The country’s news outlets have been largely bought off or bullied into silence. And yet, the results showed Mr. Modi, 73, losing his majority for the first time since he took office in 2014. Analysts said that reflected widespread dissatisfaction with how the fruits of India’s economy have been shared. While India’s steady growth has made it the envy of its neighbors — and created a conspicuous billionaire class — those riches have not flowed to the hundreds of millions of India’s poor. The government has handed out free rations of wheat, grain and cooking gas. It offers home water connections, subsidizes building supplies and gives farmers cash. But it has not tackled India’s inflation or unemployment, leaving hundreds of millions of people, especially women, chronically out of work. There is also some evidence that Mr. Modi’s appeals to Hindu nationalism were not as potent as in previous elections. The B.J.P.’s candidate did not even win the constituency that is home to the lavish Ram temple, built on grounds disputed by Hindus and Muslims. Mr. Modi inaugurated the temple just before the campaign started, hoping it would galvanize his Hindu political base. The economy figured into Mexico’s election as well, but in a very different way. While overall growth was disappointing — averaging only 1 percent a year during Mr. López Obrador’s term — the government doubled the minimum wage and strengthened the peso, lifting millions of Mexicans out of poverty. “People vote with their wallets, and it’s very obvious there’s more money in the wallets of almost everybody in Mexico,” said Diego Casteñeda Garza, a Mexican economist and historian at Uppsala University in Sweden. Still, analysts said, there was also a desire among voters to cement the change that Mr. López Obrador, a charismatic outsider, symbolized when he came to power in 2018. Even as Ms. Sheinbaum, 61, vowed to continue her mentor’s policies, she cast herself — Mexico’s first female and Jewish president — as a change agent. For Jacqueline González, 33, who works at a cargo transportation company and viewed Mexico’s previous governments as corrupt, that made voting for Ms. Sheinbaum an easy decision. “With Obrador we have already seen, although some people don’t want to admit it, some change,” Ms. González said. “Let’s hope it continues with Sheinbaum.”",india powerful leader win another term see party majority vanish

nytimes,"Rahul Gandhi, Long on the Ropes, Looks Set for an Unexpected Comeback","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-congress-rahul-gandhi.html,"Just last year, Rahul Gandhi and the once-powerful party he led, the Indian National Congress, seemed to be on the ropes and little threat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s consolidation of political power. Congress had not been a competitive factor in national elections in years, winning fewer and fewer votes each time Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party was elected. And Mr. Gandhi himself had been convicted on a slander charge and barred from holding a seat in Parliament. But on Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi and a broad opposition coalition led by his Congress party registered a far stronger showing than expected in India’s elections, setting the stage for an unlikely comeback. “He has finally arrived,” said Rasheed Kidwai, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi. “This time he has improved his vote share by at least 17 million votes, which is very substantial.” On Wednesday, Mr. Modi’s party announced that it had reached an agreement to form a governing coalition, including two parties that do not necessarily share its vision. Congress won 99 seats in the 543-seat Parliament, a gain of 47 seats, and the alliance of which it is the leading part won a total of 232. Congress and its alliance of over two dozen political groups have presented the results as a “moral victory” over a B.J.P. government that they say was trying to change the country’s Constitution and have portrayed as anathema to India’s identity as a multifaith and secular country. “The fight was to save the Constitution,” Mr. Gandhi, the son, grandson and great-grandson of Congress prime ministers, said as the results poured in. The first major sign that Congress might be able to contend came in May 2023, just a couple of months after Mr. Gandhi’s conviction for slander, when his party won the state government of Karnataka, in the south of India, from the B.J.P. The lift was temporary; Congress soon lost power in three states it governed to the B.J.P. But at the same time, political experts say, Mr. Gandhi was pushing for changes within the party, India’s oldest, which had long resisted overhauling an archaic organizational structure that kept its top leaders isolated from the grass-roots workers who deliver votes. Feelings that Congress’s leaders were corrupt and out of touch resulted in a string of defeats over a number of years and then degenerated into messy infighting within the party. For the past two years, party members say, Mr. Gandhi has tried to reverse the decline of Congress by surrounding himself with young policy analysts to help him understand the challenges facing India, as well as party veterans with their ears to the ground in towns and villages that Congress was targeting. The party has in addition improved its social media game, trumpeting its messages on platforms like WhatsApp and YouTube. Mr. Gandhi also raised his profile by embarking on two walks across India — meeting farmers in their fields and vegetable sellers on city streets; and drinking tea with recent graduates and gig workers — in an effort to show common cause with ordinary people. Perhaps most important, Congress focused on a strategy of reaching out to and cooperating with key regional players across the country whose influence had dimmed under B.J.P. rule. Congress leaders made a series of “seat-sharing” agreements with regional leaders, big and small, that strengthened the alliance against Mr. Modi’s party. To avoid splitting the anti-B.J.P. vote, Congress had its own candidates contest fewer seats. And Mr. Gandhi campaigned vigorously alongside the leaders of like-minded political groups across India. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Gandhi also won support, party leaders say, by characterizing Mr. Modi as a leader who would destroy India’s secular character. “It is a victory not just for him and our alliance partners but for the millions of poor Indians who voted to protect the secular fabric of this country,” said Srinivas B.V., another Congress leader, about Mr. Gandhi. “People showed Modi: ‘You are not God, and you can be replaced.’” Since being voted to power in 2014, Mr. Modi has sought to position Hinduism, the religion of some 80 percent of Indians, at the center of the country’s official identity. He also promised to end corruption, overhaul the economy and help India become a “developed nation” by 2047. But after his re-election in 2019, he leaned into Hindu themes to a greater extent. Mr. Gandhi’s efforts to contrast his vision for India with Mr. Modi’s largely paid off, analysts say, even if some members of his party jumped ship and sided with the B.J.P. Many of the politicians who defected from Congress to the B.J.P. lost their seats, including in West Bengal and Maharashtra, where Congress and its partners did especially well. Throughout the campaign Mr. Gandhi persistently linked Mr. Modi with Gautam Adani, Asia’s richest man, saying the prime minister was working for his tycoon friends, not for the vast majority of Indians who are poor. As if to vindicate this line of attack, over the two days after the election results were announced, the price of Mr. Adani’s flagship stock fell by 14 percent. (It then recovered somewhat on Wednesday.) “People directly correlate Adani Ji with Modi Ji — directly,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters after the results, using Hindi honorifics for the two men. Researchers who traveled across India during the voting said Mr. Gandhi had beaten Mr. Modi on his own turf in many places by focusing on issues like the millions of Indians without jobs and the economic difficulties faced by farmers. He also accused the B.J.P. of governance failures and worked with local political groups fighting for social justice and for the empowerment of lower-caste Indians. Uttar Pradesh, where Mr. Modi made dozens of visits to campaign for local candidates, is one state where the changing fortunes of the two largest political groupings was evident. The state is India’s largest, and accounts for 80 of the Parliament’s 543 seats. The B.J.P. recorded its worst performance there since 2009, in part because Mr. Gandhi was able to craft an alliance with a powerful local leader, Akhilesh Yadav. In addition to the 37 seats picked up by Mr. Yadav’s Samajwadi Party, Congress won six, helped by aggressive campaigning by Mr. Gandhi’s sister, Priyanka Vadra, who helped defeat a former soap-opera actress who had served as a minister in Mr. Modi’s government. The B.J.P. won 33 seats, down from 62 in the previous Parliament. The election results announced on Wednesday have given a major lift to hundreds of thousands of Congress workers across the country, who were growing tired of the internal infighting that has plagued their party for years. Outside Congress headquarters in New Delhi, Bansi Lal Meena, a veteran Congress member from the state of Rajasthan, was exultant about his party’s performance. “In villages and on the ground, the B.J.P. spread lies for years against us — saying that we are anti-Hindu,” he said. “They used my religion as a weapon against me to win votes.” He added: “We will show them now because our people are also in Parliament.”",last year rahul gandhi oncepowerful party led indian national congress seemed rope little threat prime minister narendra modis consolidation political power congress competitive

nytimes,Narendra Modi Fell to Earth After Making It All About Himself,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-election-modi.html,"When everything became about Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, his party and its century-old Hindu-nationalist network were propelled to unimagined heights. On the back of his singular charisma and political skill, a onetime-fringe religious ideology was pulled to the center of Indian life. Landslide election victories remade India’s politics, once dominated by diverse coalitions representing a nation that had shaped its independence on secular principles. But there were always risks in wrapping a party’s fortunes so completely in the image of one man, in inundating a country of many religions, castes and cultures with that leader’s name, face and voice. Voters could start to think that everything was about him, not them. They could even revolt. On Tuesday, Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., fell back to earth. After having promised their biggest election romp yet, they lost more than 60 seats. Mr. Modi will remain in office for a third term, but only with the help of a contentious coalition of parties, some of which are opposed to his core beliefs and want power of their own. With the result, India’s strained democracy appeared to roar back to life, its beaten-down political opposition reinvigorated. And after a decade in which Mr. Modi’s success in entrenching Hindu supremacy had often felt like the new common sense, India is seeing its leader and itself in a new light, and trying to understand this unexpected turn. Most fundamentally, the opposition, newly coalesced for what it called a do-or-die moment as Mr. Modi increasingly tilted the playing field, found a way to use the cult of personality around him to its advantage. Opposition leaders focused on bread-and-butter issues, often at granular levels in particular constituencies. They hammered Mr. Modi over persistent unemployment and stark inequality. But the B.J.P., with Mr. Modi from on high its only spokesman, was often left with just one answer: Trust in “Modi’s guarantee.” “The ‘Modi’s guarantee’ slogan turned out to be our undoing,” said Ajay Singh Gaur, a B.J.P. worker who had campaigned in the party stronghold of Uttar Pradesh, the northern state where Mr. Modi suffered his biggest blow on Tuesday, losing nearly half of the B.J.P. seats. “The opposition made that sound like this was not about him having delivered, or trying to deliver,” Mr. Gaur said, “but about him being an arrogant politician.” Mr. Modi gave his adversaries a lot to work with, even declaring that he may not be “biological” and that he had been sent by God. He has still emerged better so far than other Indian leaders who deeply centralized power. He remains in control of levers of power that could help him and his party restore their dominance. Indira Gandhi, who had also glorified herself and went so far as to suspend India’s democracy after declaring a national emergency, was voted out at the peak of her powers before returning three years later. But Mr. Modi’s B.J.P., the world’s largest political party, finds itself in a tough spot after years of centralization and reliance on a government machinery put to the service of one man, analysts say. The huge advantage the party has built in numbers and resources is undercut by a lack of internal consultation and delegation of authority. That was a key reason for its failure in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, with 240 million people, and surrounding states. Local B.J.P. leaders were disenchanted by a top-down approach toward choosing candidates, as well as what they called a misguided belief that Mr. Modi’s popularity could allow the party to sidestep potent local issues and caste factors. With Mr. Modi sucking up all the oxygen at the top, other senior leaders of the party have been left to fight for relevance and a voice. His relentless self-promotion has also alienated the leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., the B.J.P.’s right-wing fountainhead. During election seasons, the R.S.S. activates its vast grass-roots network in support of B.J.P. candidates. While Mr. Modi, a former foot soldier in the organization, has advanced many of its goals, his consolidation of power goes against its regimented nature and its focus on ideology over individual personalities. One R.S.S. insider, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking, said that Mr. Modi’s exalting of himself had created such resentment inside the group that some of its leaders welcomed any sort of reality check for him, short of his ouster. Sudheendra Kulkarni, a political analyst who served as an aide to the first B.J.P. prime minister in the 1990s, said Mr. Modi had pushed through unpopular legislation — in particular farm laws that prompted a yearlong protest that choked New Delhi — without consulting with party officials in the affected states. They were left to cope with the ramifications. “The B.J.P. was never a one-leader party,” Mr. Kulkarni said. “All that changed with Narendra Modi in 2014. He sought to promote a new authoritarian idea of one nation, one leader.” Hypothesizing that Mr. Modi’s popularity had peaked, the opposition saw an opening to go after a decisive section of votes in the Indian political formula. For decades before his rise in 2014, neither the B.J.P. nor the Indian National Congress, the country’s two largest parties, could muster majorities on its own. Mr. Modi expanded his party’s backing by consolidating right-wing Hindu voters and drawing in new supporters with his personal story of a humble caste and economic background and a promise to change lives through robust development. A decade later, in this year’s election, the opposition found traction in painting a very different picture of Mr. Modi — as an autocratic friend of billionaires. Since Mr. Modi had achieved everything he had set out to do, the opposition argued, his pursuit of a resounding majority could only mean that he would seek radical change to the Constitution. That claim stirred anxiety among India’s Dalits and other underprivileged groups, who see the Constitution as their only protection in a deeply unequal society, guaranteeing them a share of government jobs and seats in higher education as well as elected bodies. The opposition was able to push the message harder when some in Mr. Modi’s right-wing support base, long seen as having an upper-caste bias, called for revoking the quotas. Caste identity was a major driving factor for voters in many states, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, with its 80 parliamentary seats. The decline of a Dalit party in the state meant that about 20 percent of the votes were potentially up for grabs. In Ayodhya, the constituency where Mr. Modi inaugurated a grand Ram temple earlier this year in an effort to consolidate his Hindu support base, the opposition put up a Dalit candidate. He handily defeated the B.J.P.’s two-term incumbent. In other cases, voters showed their anger over the B.J.P.’s perceived sense of impunity. In Kheri, a constituency where the son of a B.J.P. minister rammed his S.U.V. into a crowd of protesting farmers, killing several, the minister also lost. Mr. Modi’s election campaign took its most divisive turn in Banswara, in the desert state of Rajasthan, where he called India’s 200 million Muslims “infiltrators” and raised fears that the opposition would give them India’s wealth, including Hindu women’s necklaces. Banswara’s B.J.P. incumbent was routed in the election. While the loss was most likely attributable to local issues, the national discussion noted that Mr. Modi’s comments had not helped. In his own constituency of Varanasi, in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Modi’s winning margin of nearly half a million votes in 2019 shrank to about 150,000 — a disappointing showing after he had dispatched some of the B.J.P.’s most senior leaders to camp out there to help him achieve an even bigger victory. Jai Prakash, a tea and samosa seller in Varanasi, said some of the prime minister’s work, particularly his improvement of roads, was popular. But Mr. Modi was losing the plot, Mr. Prakash said, by turning to issues disconnected from people’s day-to-day lives. “Prices are skyrocketing; so is unemployment,” Mr. Prakash said. “He has done some good. But people cannot worship him endlessly.”",everything became prime minister narendra modi india party centuryold hindunationalist network propelled unimagined height back singular charisma political

nytimes,"India Keeps Its Glorious, Messy Tradition Alive","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/opinion/india-election-modi-bjp-democracy.html,"Back in January, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India looked all but unstoppable, he visited the small city of Ayodhya for the unofficial start of his campaign to win a third term. The location was freighted with symbolism. For decades, Hindu nationalists had sought to build a temple in Ayodhya, at a spot they believe to be the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. The only problem was that there was already a house of worship on the spot, a mosque built by a Mughal emperor in 1528. A Hindu mob had dismantled the mosque in 1992, setting off riots that killed 2,000 people, most of them Muslims. The ruins were a flashpoint of religious tensions in India for decades. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party promised to build the temple, and the lavish event at which Modi officially opened it was a showcase for that achievement. At the time it seemed like strong election-year messaging for a politician who built his career on the twin planks of Hindu nationalism and building a muscular new India. Unlike other politicians, the event implied, Modi made promises and kept them. “It is the beginning of a new era,” he declared. Feeling supremely confident, Modi had boldly asked the Indian electorate for something akin to a blank check to remake the country — control of 400 seats in Parliament in elections that began in April and concluded on June 1. And why shouldn’t he have been confident? India’s economy was the fastest-growing in the world. India had overtaken China as the world’s most-populous country. World leaders sought Modi’s support on issues ranging from the war in Ukraine to the climate crisis, cementing India’s ascent in global affairs. But the ever unpredictable electorate of the world’s largest democracy responded to Modi’s demand for still more power resolutely: No thanks. In a stunning rebuke, election results released on Tuesday showed that India’s voters have reduced the parliamentary share of Modi’s party by more than 60 seats, not enough for an outright majority, never mind the supermajority he had sought. It struck me as particularly apt that despite all the fanfare about the glorious new temple in Ayodhya, Modi’s party lost the city’s parliamentary seat to a political opposition that had been all but left for dead. There appears to be a clear ceiling to the appeals to Hindu identity on its own. “We are very happy with the temple, but people were fed up with the B.J.P.,” a local business leader, Rakesh Yadav, told Reuters. “People will not always fall for the caste or temple-mosque politics. They also want to see development.” This is a big year for democracy, almost a referendum of sorts on the very idea. Dozens of countries are holding elections, representing roughly half of the world’s population. But authoritarianism has been on the march. The latest report from Freedom House found that by many measures, global freedom has declined for the 18th straight year. India, despite its status as the world’s most-populous democracy, has been a poster child for this decline under Modi: His government has taken aim at just about every form of freedom. He has attacked and grievously weakened the independence of India’s once boisterous press. He has jailed critics and political opponents. He has sharpened religious animosity, referring during this campaign to Muslims, who make up 14 percent of India’s population, as “infiltrators” who seek to steal wealth and power from the Hindu majority. It’s an Indian edition of the nationalist, populist playbook playing out around the world. That a newly unified opposition managed to prevent Modi’s party from winning an outright majority under these conditions took everyone, including me, by surprise. And it suggests that even when would-be authoritarians attempt to tilt the playing field, voters can and will state their will, no matter the autocrat’s preferences. “The B.J.P. had positioned itself as a new hegemonic power,” Yamini Aiyar, a scholar and analyst of Indian democracy who has been a frequent target of Hindu nationalist rage, told me. “The beauty of an election is that politicians have to go to the people, and the people get an opportunity to express their anxieties and their perspectives.” Express them they did. Looking back, the weakness of the B.J.P.’s re-election case is clear: Yes, India’s economy was growing fast. But despite the flashy new infrastructure projects and deals to increase high-tech manufacturing, the growth was not creating nearly enough jobs, and inflation remained stubbornly high, especially for food, which hits the poorest hardest. Much of the wealth generated by growth has gone to India’s richest tycoons, and inequality has soared. “The reality is that the real economy has been hurting for a very long time, and they have systematically sought to ignore it,” Aiyar said. India has managed to lift millions of people out of poverty since Modi came to power 10 years ago, but particularly in rural areas, where most Indians live, that has meant social welfare rather than jobs. There were other issues too — Modi’s allies had floated the idea of changing India’s Constitution in various ways, including removing its commitment to secularism and enshrining Hinduism as the national faith. These kinds of appeals have helped the B.J.P. in the past but seem to have had less power this time around. One clear sign was its heavy losses in Uttar Pradesh, which is not just India’s most populous state; it is also part of the heavily Hindu heartland of northern India. It also seems that the opposition may finally have gotten its act together. India’s main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, has been in decline for years and had struggled to make common cause with other opposition parties in previous elections. But this year the opposition parties managed to make a much stronger coalition. They focused on kitchen table issues and highlighted the Modi government’s ties to big business and high-flying billionaires. The opposition didn’t shy away from making the stakes for Indian democracy clear. But the relentless focus on what voters said mattered most offers lessons for those battling revanchist movements elsewhere, including in the United States. Sometimes you need to meet voters where they are. This vote wasn’t a total rebuke of Modi and his policies. He is all but certain to get his third term as prime minister by making a coalition with allied parties. But it is a clear and salutary check on his authoritarian project. This election is also a rebuke of Indian elites — in business and media especially — who had willingly surrendered to a kind of inevitability of Modi’s long-term consolidation of power, making peace with it or even celebrating it. Activists, analysts and journalists who had the temerity to speak plainly about Modi’s revanchist project and the threat he posed to the world’s biggest democracy and its long history of tolerance, secularism and free speech have been hounded out of public life. I hope that this troubling slide ends now. As the results rolled in on Tuesday, I remembered my own reporting trip to Ayodhya in 2009, when I was a correspondent for The Times based in India. An explosive new government report had just been issued about the destruction of the mosque and the role of Hindu nationalist groups in stirring up violence. But when I got there, I was surprised to find that on the hotly contested spot itself there was hardly any hoopla. The crowds of Hindu nationalist volunteers who for years had routinely shown up to build the temple with their bare hands had disappeared. India was going through a period of hopeful prosperity. Voters had just returned the Indian National Congress party and its allies to power with a larger majority, and a brilliant, teetotaling economist named Manmohan Singh was prime minister. With the future looking so alluring, no one seemed all that interested in litigating the past. These hopes were ultimately dashed amid scandals over political corruption and mismanagement. The Congress party, which once seemed unstoppable, lost power in 2014 for failing to deliver on its promise to bring India to its long-awaited place among the world’s richest and most powerful nations. The years ahead will, with any luck, be ones of negotiation and compromise. This will be a return to form for India, a vastly diverse nation whose unruly polity has resisted autocracy at every turn since it shrugged off British colonial rule in 1947. The whole world should breathe a sigh of relief that India’s voters have spoken, loudly, in favor of continuing that glorious, messy tradition.",back january prime minister narendra modi india looked

The result was different in this vote. It was still a victory, but one that left him dependent on a host of coalition partners — particularly on politicians from two regional parties who could make or break Mr. Modi’s ability to form a government. Of the more than a dozen parties that make up the B.J.P.’s coalition, known as the National Democratic Alliance, most won just one or two seats, leaving the party in a difficult predicament. On Wednesday, the B.J.P. said it had reached an agreement to form a coalition government that includes those two regional parties — the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United. They will be the biggest junior partners, but they are also avowedly secular and removed from Mr. Modi’s Hindu-nationalist ideology. Cameras on Wednesday followed every word, meeting and movement of the leaders of the two parties, N. Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party, and Nitish Kumar of Janata Dal-United. Their combined 28 seats in Parliament will give the prime minister the votes he needs to stay in power and push through his agenda.

nytimes,"Modi se reelige en India, pero pierde mayoría parlamentaria: 4 claves de las elecciones","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/06/05/espanol/elecciones-india-modi.html,"[Estamos en WhatsApp. Empieza a seguirnos ahora] La primera década de Narendra Modi como primer ministro de India ha estado plagada de sorpresas. Ninguna, sin embargo, se comparó con lo que ocurrió el martes por la mañana, cuando Modi ganó su segunda reelección, pero su partido perdió la mayoría en el Parlamento. Con esa derrota, el aire de invencibilidad de Modi también pareció desvanecerse por primera vez desde que asumió el cargo en 2014. Los resultados de las elecciones fueron particularmente interesantes porque, tras casi siete semanas de votaciones en todo el país, las encuestas a pie de urna publicadas pocos días antes del recuento final mostraban que el Partido Popular Indio de Modi ganaría de forma aplastante, como ya había hecho en dos ocasiones anteriores. Sin embargo, el Partido Popular Indio solo obtuvo 239 escaños, muy por debajo de los 272 necesarios para formar gobierno. La alianza de la oposición, liderada por el Partido del Congreso Nacional Indio, obtuvo 235 escaños. Con los 52 escaños obtenidos por los aliados del Partido Popular Indio, Modi seguirá a la cabeza. Pero su atractivo ha disminuido y su liderazgo ha cambiado radicalmente. Cuando Modi llegó al poder en 2014, prometió progreso económico, el fin de la corrupción y la promoción del hinduismo como elemento central de la identidad india. Con todo ello, se presentó como un líder singularmente fuerte, capaz de reunir a sus seguidores para trabajar por la nación. Esto contrastaba con el gobierno anterior. Antes de que Modi fuera elegido por primera vez, India llevaba 25 años gobernada por coaliciones. Los primeros ministros del Partido del Congreso, del Partido Popular Indio y de terceros partidos más pequeños se alternaban para dirigir India por comités. Modi rompió con esa tradición y lideró un nuevo sistema de partido único dominado por el Partido Popular Indio. Como líder, Modi mostró poco interés en compartir el poder. Cuando invalidó la mayor parte del papel moneda de India en 2016, ni siquiera su ministro de Finanzas conocía la decisión de antemano. Cuando decidió imponer la ley marcial en Jammu y Cachemira, el único estado de mayoría musulmana de India, presentó el plan al Parlamento como un hecho, sin pedir su aprobación. Pero esos días han terminado. Los dos mayores partidos que han surgido como nuevos socios de coalición del Partido Popular Indio están liderados por N. Chandrababu Naidu y Nitish Kumar, legisladores veteranos a quienes se conoce como tecnócratas moderados. Es probable que ambos exijan más autoridad en el Parlamento. De hecho, ambos han sido señalados como posibles candidatos a primer ministro, si se produjera otra coalición que no estuviera liderada ni por el Partido Popular Indio ni por el Congreso Nacional Indio. Cuando el martes se dieron a conocer los primeros mapas electorales nacionales que mostraban el número de escaños ganados y perdidos en el Parlamento, se observó una nueva y sorprendente configuración. Los mapas mostraban que el partido de Modi había perdido zonas de territorio en los estados del norte de habla hindi, considerados bastiones del Partido Popular Indio. Al mismo tiempo, el su partido avanzó en regiones que se habían resistido a Modi en el pasado. Perdió decenas de escaños en el estado septentrional de Uttar Pradesh, pero ganó muchos en el estado oriental de Odisha y en el estado meridional de Telangana. La única parte del país que ahora parece unificada por un partido es el “cinturón tribal”, que atraviesa los estados centrales. Sus comunidades relativamente pobres han sido hábilmente puestas en la mira de la política hinduista y los beneficios sociales del Partido Popular Indio. Los inversores de los mercados bursátiles indios de Mumbai respondieron con entusiasmo a las primeras encuestas a pie de urna. El lunes, se lanzaron a la compra, haciendo subir los precios de las llamadas acciones de Modi, aquellas asociadas a las prioridades de gasto del primer ministro o que se cree que se benefician de sus políticas fiscales. Cuando se conocieron los resultados de las urnas, esas acciones se desplomaron. Las acciones del buque insignia del Grupo Adani perdieron cerca del 19 por ciento de su valor en un solo día de cotización. El índice bursátil perdió cerca del 6 por ciento, casi anulando las ganancias de los cinco primeros meses del año. Modi sigue siendo popular entre los magnates de India, pero los inversores deben averiguar qué empresas se beneficiarán del nuevo gobierno. Chris Wood, responsable mundial de estrategia de renta variable del banco de inversión Jefferies, advirtió el año pasado que si Modi perdía, “cabría esperar una corrección del 25 por ciento, si no más”, en el mercado bursátil indio. Históricamente, a las empresas indias les ha ido igual de bien durante los periodos de gobierno de coalición. Por lo tanto, Wood dijo que, incluso sin Modi en el poder, espera que las acciones “se recuperen bruscamente” sobre la base de la fortaleza de la economía del país en su conjunto. Esta nueva era en el Parlamento empezará seguramente con algunas rondas de retribuciones políticas. Los políticos que no hayan conseguido escaños para sus jefes serán despedidos. Es probable que los partidos más pequeños exijan puestos en el gabinete, lo que significará sustituir a miembros del Partido Popular Indio. Habrá que revisar las políticas. ¿Se inclinará India por la exportación de manufacturas, con el objetivo de sustituir a China como la fábrica del mundo? ¿Protegerá ahora a las industrias locales que temen la competencia extranjera? Milan Vaishnav, investigador de la Fundación Carnegie para la Paz Internacional, advirtió que India no puede volver exactamente a la política de coalición que precedió a Modi. Es probable que sus nuevos socios exijan un estilo autoritario similar al que Modi ejerce desde Nueva Delhi. El tipo de líderes estatales que necesita ahora como socios de coalición “son tan absolutistas como el gobierno nacional”, dijo Vaishnav. Podrían, por ejemplo, pedir a la policía federal que detuviera a sus oponentes, como ha hecho Modi. Las elecciones de India fueron las mayores celebradas en la historia de la democracia, con más de 600 millones de votantes en seis fases. Esta vez no hubo quejas sobre las máquinas de votación electrónica, ni temores de que India se hubiera convertido en una dictadura bajo el mandato de Modi. En un discurso difícil pronunciado el martes por la noche desde la sede del Partido Popular Indio, Modi calificó las elecciones de “celebración de la democracia”.",estamos en whatsapp empieza

nytimes,Modi Struggles to Stay on Top: 4 Takeaways From India’s Election,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-election-2024-takeaways.html,"Narendra Modi’s first decade as India’s prime minister came with its fair share of surprises. None, however, looked anything like what happened on Tuesday morning when he won his second re-election, but lost his party’s majority in Parliament. With that loss, Mr. Modi’s air of invincibility also appeared to be fading for the first time since he took office in 2014. The election results were especially shocking because, after nearly seven sweaty weeks of voting across the country, exit polls released just days before the final tally showed that Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party would win in a landslide, as it had twice before. Instead, the Bharatiya Janata Party won only 240 seats, well short of the 272 needed to form a government. The opposition alliance, led by the Indian National Congress Party, took 235 seats. With the 52 seats won by B.J.P. allies, Mr. Modi will remain on top. But his allure has been diminished, and his leadership has fundamentally changed. When Mr. Modi came to power in 2014, he promised economic progress, an end to corruption and to promote Hinduism as being central to India’s identity. Through it all, he presented himself as a uniquely strong leader, capable of marshaling his followers to work for the nation. This was in contrast to the previous government. Before Mr. Modi was first elected, India spent 25 years being governed by coalitions. Prime ministers from the Congress Party, the B.J.P. and smaller third parties took turns running India by committee. Mr. Modi broke with that tradition, leading a new single-party system dominated by the B.J.P. As leader, Mr. Modi showed little interest in sharing power. When he invalidated most of India’s paper currency in 2016, not even his finance minister knew about the decision in advance. When he decided to impose de facto martial law on Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state, he presented the plan to Parliament as a done deal, without seeking approval. But those days are over. The two biggest parties that have emerged as the B.J.P.’s new coalition partners are led by N. Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar, veteran lawmakers who are known as technocratic moderates. Both are likely to demand greater authority in Parliament. In fact, both have been eyed as possible candidates for prime minister, if there were to be another coalition led by neither the B.J.P. nor the Congress. When the first nationwide electoral maps showing the number of seats gained and lost in Parliament were revealed on Tuesday, they showed a striking new pattern. The maps showed that Mr. Modi’s party lost swaths of territory across states in the Hindi-speaking north that were considered B.J.P. strongholds. At the same time, the B.J.P. made inroads in regions that had resisted Mr. Modi in the past. He lost dozens of seats in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, but he gained plenty in the eastern state of Odisha and the southern state of Telangana. The only part of the country that now looks unified by one party is the “tribal belt,” which weaves across the central states. Its relatively poor communities have been skillfully targeted by the B.J.P.’s Hindu-first politics and welfare benefits. Investors in India’s stock markets in Mumbai responded eagerly to the early exit polls. On Monday, they went on a buying spree, driving up the prices of so-called Modi stocks, those associated with the prime minister’s spending priorities or thought to benefit from his fiscal policies. When the actual vote results were counted, those stocks came crashing down. Shares in the Adani Group’s flagship stock lost about 19 percent of their value in one day of trading. The blue-chip index lost about 6 percent, nearly wiping out its gains from the first five months of the year. Mr. Modi remains popular with India’s business tycoons, but investors need to find out which companies will stand to benefit from a new government. Chris Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, an investment bank, warned last year that if Mr. Modi were to lose he “would expect a 25 percent correction, if not more” in the Indian stock market. Historically, Indian companies have done just as well during periods of coalition government. So, Mr. Wood said, even without Mr. Modi in power, he expects stocks to “bounce back sharply” based on the strength of the country’s economy as a whole. This new era in Parliament is sure to begin with a few rounds of political retribution. Politicians who failed to deliver seats for their bosses will be shown the door. Smaller parties are likely to demand cabinet positions, which will mean replacing members of the B.J.P. Policies will need to be revised. Will India lean into export manufacturing, aiming to replace China as the world’s factory? Will it move to protect local industries that fear foreign competition? Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, cautioned that India cannot exactly return to the coalition politics that preceded Mr. Modi. His new partners are likely to make demands that match the authoritarian style Mr. Modi exercises from New Delhi. The kind of state leaders he now needs as coalition partners “are just as absolutist as the national government,” Mr. Vaishnav said. They could, for instance, call for federal police agencies to arrest opponents, as Mr. Modi has done. India’s election was the biggest conducted in the history of democracy, with more than 600 million voters casting ballots in six phases. This time, there were no complaints about the electronic voting machines, or fears that India had become a dictatorship under Mr. Modi. In a difficult speech delivered on Tuesday night from the B.J.P. headquarters, Mr. Modi called the election a “celebration of democracy.”",narendra modis first decade india prime minister came fair share surprise none however looked anything like happened tuesday morning second reelection lost party majority parliament loss mr modis air invincibility also appeared fading first time since took office election result especially shocking nearly seven sweaty week voting across country exit poll released day final tally showed mr modis bharatiya janata party would win landslide twice instead bharatiya janata party seat well short needed form government opposition alliance led indian national congress party took seat seat bjp ally mr modi remain top allure diminished leadership fundamentally changed mr modi came power promised economic progress end corruption promote hinduism central india identity presented uniquely strong leader capable marshaling follower work nation contrast previous government mr modi first elected india spent year governed coalition prime minister congress party bjp smaller third party took turn running india committee mr modi broke tradition leading new singleparty system dominated bjp leader mr modi showed little interest sharing power invalidated india paper currency even finance minister knew decision advance decided impose de facto martial law jammu kashmir india muslimmajority state presented plan parliament done deal without seeking approval day two biggest party emerged bjps new coalition partner led n chandrababu naidu nitish kumar veteran lawmaker known technocratic moderate likely demand greater authority parliament fact eyed possible candidate prime minister another coalition led neither bjp congress first nationwide electoral map showing number seat gained lost parliament revealed tuesday showed striking new pattern map showed mr modis party lost swath territory across state hindispeaking north considered bjp stronghold time bjp made inroad region resisted mr modi past lost dozen seat northern state uttar pradesh gained plenty eastern state odisha southern state telangana part country look unified one party tribal belt weave across central state relatively poor community skillfully targeted bjps hindufirst politics welfare benefit investor india stock market mumbai responded eagerly early exit poll monday went buying spree driving price socalled modi stock associated prime minister spending priority thought benefit fiscal policy actual vote result counted stock came crashing share adani group flagship stock lost percent value one day trading bluechip index lost percent nearly wiping gain first five month year mr modi remains popular india business tycoon investor need find company stand benefit new government chris wood global head equity strategy jefferies investment bank warned last year mr modi lose would expect percent correction indian stock market historically indian company done well period coalition government mr wood said even without mr modi power expects stock bounce back sharply based strength country economy whole new era parliament sure begin round political retribution politician failed deliver seat boss shown door smaller party likely demand cabinet position mean replacing member bjp policy need revised india lean export manufacturing aiming replace china world factory move protect local industry fear foreign competition milan vaishnav senior fellow carnegie endowment international peace cautioned india exactly return coalition politics preceded mr modi new partner likely make demand match authoritarian style mr modi exercise new delhi kind state leader need coalition partner absolutist national government mr vaishnav said could instance call federal police agency arrest opponent mr modi done india election biggest conducted history democracy million voter casting ballot six phase time complaint electronic voting machine fear india become dictatorship mr modi difficult speech delivered tuesday night bjp headquarters mr modi called election celebration democracy
nytimes,"Needing Help to Stay in Power, Modi Loses His Aura of Invincibility","June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/modi-india-election.html,"Suddenly, the aura of invincibility around Narendra Modi has been shattered. In an Indian election in which his party’s slogan had promised a landslide victory and Mr. Modi even repeatedly referred to himself as sent by God, the results announced on Tuesday were unexpectedly sobering. Mr. Modi, 73, is set to take up a third consecutive term as prime minister, after the Election Commission gave final confirmation early Wednesday that the parties that make up his coalition had collectively passed the majority mark in Parliament. It is a feat that only one other Indian leader has accomplished, and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., won far more seats than any other party. But instead of a runaway win, the B.J.P. lost dozens of seats. It now finds itself at the mercy of its coalition partners — including one politician notorious for how often he has switched sides — to stay in power, a sharp reversal a decade into Mr. Modi’s transformational tenure. As the results came into view, the country’s stock markets plunged. Opposition parties, newly unified in what they had called an effort to save the country’s democracy, rejoiced. And India, while extending Mr. Modi’s firm hold on power, learned that there are limits to his political potency, even as he made the election, usually fought seat by seat, squarely about himself. Mr. Modi took a more positive view in a statement on X declaring that his coalition had won a third term. “This is a historical feat in India’s history,” he said. For Mr. Modi, a generous reading of the outcome could be that only with his personal push could his party overcome its unpopularity at the local level and scrape by. Or it could be that his carefully cultivated brand has now peaked, and that he can no longer outrun the anti-incumbency sentiment that eventually catches up with almost any politician. How Mr. Modi will react is uncertain — whether he will harden his effort to turn away any challenge to his power, or be chastened by the voters’ verdict and his need to work with coalition partners that do not share his Hindu-nationalist ideology. “Modi is not known as a consensual figure. However, he is very pragmatic,” said Arati Jerath, a political analyst based in New Delhi. “He will have to moderate his hard-line Hindu-nationalist approach to issues. Perhaps we can hope for more moderation from him.” Few doubt, however, that Mr. Modi will try to deepen his already considerable imprint on the country over the next five years. On his watch, India, the world’s most populous nation, has enjoyed newfound prominence on the global stage, overhauled its infrastructure for the needs of its 1.4 billion people, and been imbued with a new sense of ambition as it tries to shed the legacy of its long colonial past. At the same time, Mr. Modi has worked to turn a vastly diverse country held together by a secular democratic system into an overtly Hindu-first state, marginalizing the country’s large Muslim minority. His increasingly authoritarian turn — with a crackdown on dissent that has created a chilling environment of self-censorship — has pushed India’s vociferous democracy closer to a one-party state, his critics say. And the country’s economic growth, while rapid, has mostly enriched those at the top. Mr. Modi rose from a humble background as the son of a tea seller, becoming India’s most powerful and popular leader in decades by building a cult of personality, spending big on infrastructure and welfare, and tilting India’s democratic institutions in his favor. The ultimate goal was to cement his standing as one of the most consequential prime ministers in India’s nearly 75 years as a republic and make the B.J.P. the country’s only plausible national governing force. But the results on Tuesday pointed to a sharp turnaround for India’s beleaguered main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, which had been seen by many as irrevocably weakened after big losses in the previous two elections. The once-dominant Congress, long positioned at India’s political center, struggled for years to find a direction and offer an ideological alternative to the B.J.P. But it and its coalition partners found traction in this election by attacking Mr. Modi’s government over issues like unemployment, social justice and the prime minister’s ties to India’s billionaires. Last year, as Rahul Gandhi, the public face of the Congress party, sought to burnish his standing by leading long marches across India, the B.J.P. ensnared him in a court case that led to his expulsion from Parliament. He was later returned to his seat by India’s highest court, and was set to win re-election on Tuesday. Speaking as early returns came in, Mr. Gandhi, 53, said the fight was not just against the B.J.P. It was also, he said, against all the government institutions that had stood with Mr. Modi in trying to hamstring the opposition through arrests and other punitive actions. “This was about saving the Constitution,” he said, lifting a small copy that he had been carrying with him and displaying during speeches on the campaign trail. Exit polls released on Saturday, after more than six weeks of voting in the world’s largest democratic exercise, indicated that Mr. Modi’s party was headed toward an easy victory. But there had been signs during the campaign that Mr. Modi was worried about the outcome. He crisscrossed the country for more than 200 rallies over about two months and gave dozens of interviews, hoping to use his charismatic appeal to paper over any weaknesses in his party. In speeches, he often veered from his party’s message of a rising India to counter accusations that he privileged business and caste elites. He also abandoned his once-subtle dog whistles targeting India’s 200 million Muslims, instead demonizing them directly, by name. As things stood by nightfall, Mr. Modi would need at least 33 seats from allies to cross the 272 minimum for forming a government. Two regional parties in particular would be kingmakers: the Telugu Desam Party, in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, with 16 seats, and the Janata Dal (United) party in the eastern state of Bihar, with 12. Both parties are avowedly secular, raising hopes among Mr. Modi’s opponents that their influence could slow down his race to turn India’s democracy into a Hindu-first state. Some of Mr. Modi’s biggest losses came in India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh in the north, with about 240 million people. His party leads the state government and had won 62 of the state’s 80 seats in the national Parliament’s lower house in the previous election, in 2019. As counting entered its last stretch in the evening on Tuesday, the B.J.P. was leading in only 33 seats there. In his own constituency, Varanasi, Mr. Modi’s victory margin was reduced from half a million last time to about 150,000. The loss in Faizabad constituency, in particular, told the story of how some of the prime minister’s biggest offerings had struggled to connect with voters. The constituency is home to the lavish Ram temple in Ayodhya, built on grounds disputed between Hindus and Muslims. Its construction was a cornerstone of the nearly century-old Hindu-nationalist movement that had swept Mr. Modi to power. He hoped that its grand inauguration just before the election campaign began would both unite his Hindu support base and bring new supporters into the fold. Some B.J.P. workers said that the party’s flaunting of the temple may have made a large section of Hindus at the bottom of the rigid caste hierarchy uncomfortable. The opposition had painted Mr. Modi as pursuing an upper-caste agenda that denied underprivileged Hindus opportunities to reverse centuries of oppression. “Because of overemphasis on the Ram temple issue, the opposition got united,” said Subhash Punia, 62, a farmer from the state of Rajasthan who supports Mr. Modi and was waiting outside the B.J.P. headquarters in Delhi on Tuesday. To offset potential losses in his Hindi-speaking northern stronghold, Mr. Modi had set a lofty goal for this election: to gain a foothold in the country’s more prosperous south. He broke some new ground in Kerala, a state dominated by the political left and long hostile to his ideology. But overall in the south, he struggled to improve on the 29 seats, out of 129, that his party had won in the previous election. Perhaps the biggest disappointment for the B.J.P. in southern India was that it once again appeared not to have won any of the 40 seats in Tamil Nadu, a state with its own strong cultural and linguistic identity. Mr. Modi had campaigned aggressively there, even visiting one coastal town for two days of meditation as the voting neared its conclusion. “Mr. Modi’s and the B.J.P.’s antics cannot win my Tamil heart,” said S. Ganesan, a waiter at a hotel in Kanniyakumari, the town Mr. Modi visited.",suddenly aura invincibility around narendra modi shattered indian election party slogan promised landslide victory mr modi

nytimes,Modi Will Feel the Heat in a Third Term. And Not Just Politically.,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/climate/modi-climate-india-election.html,"India, the world’s most populous country, is also among the most vulnerable to climate hazards. That’s not only because of the heat and floods that global warming has exacerbated, but also because so many of the country’s 1.4 billion people are vulnerable to begin with. Most people are poor, by global standards, and they have no safety net. Narendra Modi, the Hindu nationalist prime minister who claimed victory Tuesday for a third five-year term, will face major challenges fueled by climate change. The six-week process of voting took place amid a scorching heat wave in several parts of the country. In the northern states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, at least 33 people, including poll workers, died of complications from the heat last week, according to government authorities cited by Reuters. Rohit Magotra, deputy director of Integrated Research and Action for Development, called on national election officials to reschedule elections in the future to avoid such calamities. He pointed out that workers from every political party suffer in the heat, and so do voters, who often have to line up under the sun. “I definitely see the momentum building up, and elections are unlikely to be scheduled in peak summer in future,” said Mr. Magotra, whose organization has advocated heat solutions in Indian cities. The Election Commission this year did set up a task force to monitor weather conditions, but only after voting got underway amid abnormally high temperatures. It also sent election workers a list of heat precautions prepared by the National Disaster Management Agency. However, according to a report published in Scroll, an Indian news site, political-party campaigners were not told to do anything differently because of the heat.",india world populous country also among vulnerable climate hazard thats heat flood global warming exacerbated also many country billion people vulnerable begin people poor global standard safety net narendra modi hindu nationalist prime minister claimed victory tuesday third fiveyear term face major challenge fueled climate change sixweek process voting took place amid scorching heat wave several part country northern state bihar uttar pradesh least people including poll worker died complication heat last week according government authority cited reuters rohit magotra deputy director integrated research action development called national election official reschedule election future avoid calamity pointed worker every political party suffer heat voter often line sun definitely see momentum building election unlikely scheduled peak summer future said mr magotra whose organization advocated heat solution indian city election commission year set task force monitor weather condition voting got underway amid abnormally high temperature also sent election worker list heat precaution prepared national disaster management agency however according report published scroll indian news site politicalparty campaigner told anything differently heat
nytimes,India’s Stock Market Tumbles on Close-Run Election Result,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-stock-market-election.html,"Traders in Mumbai started the day with a shock as India began tallying votes from a seven-week election and it became clear that the government of Narendra Modi was not doing nearly as well as expected. By the end of trading on Tuesday, the markets were down 6 percent, nearly wiping out the year’s gains. India’s stock market had been on a tear, buoyed by economic growth and confidence that Mr. Modi, the most powerful prime minister in generations, was sure to secure a third term in office. Investors looking to India yearn for political stability and many have done especially well during the first 10 years of Mr. Modi’s pro-business leadership. Even after Tuesday’s decline, the blue-chip Nifty 50 index has nearly tripled since Mr. Modi became prime minister. But the Indian market’s main indexes have entered choppier waters on the way to the election. Some companies, namely those considered “Modi stocks,” fared especially poorly as the election result came into view. The Adani Group’s fortunes were always the most eye-catching. Gautam Adani rapidly became Asia’s richest man, as his infrastructure-oriented businesses worked in harmony with Mr. Modi’s plans for the country. That is, until a short-seller’s report in early 2023 accused the Adani Group of market manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani’s stocks crashed, but within a year, as it became clear that the Indian government and many of the world’s biggest banks would be patient with the companies, they climbed back up. On Tuesday, Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship company, shed 19 percent of its value, putting it halfway between its peak and subsequent trough. Mr. Modi has anyway won enough seats to form a new government, albeit with a much slimmer majority than forecast. Chris Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, an investment bank, last year gamed out an even worse result for Mr. Modi, saying during an investor summit in October that if Mr. Modi were suddenly defeated, “I would expect a 25 percent correction if not more.” Some degree of correction might be welcomed, at least among professional investors. A lot of the market’s recent growth has reflected the influx of small-time local investors buying stocks for the first time. With global investors clamoring for access to India’s long-term prospects, it had become nearly impossible to find bargains. Christine Phillpotts, portfolio manager for emerging markets at Ariel Investments in Chicago, said India had become “the market that everybody loves to love.” That meant there weren’t many opportunities left, even though she agreed that India’s economy would keep growing robustly. The other consolation is that, as much as investors need to know which government policies will favor which companies, India’s track record suggests that its economy is capable of growing rapidly under conditions of vigorous, multiparty democracy. Some of the fastest rates it ever clocked were achieved under a previous coalition government, during a growth spurt from 2006 to 2010. Even Mr. Wood, who anticipated a market decline in response to Mr. Modi’s losing ground, thought that stocks “would bounce back sharply, due to the momentum” of India’s economy as a whole.",trader mumbai started day shock india began tallying vote sevenweek election became clear government narendra modi nearly well expected end trading tuesday market percent nearly wiping year gain india stock market tear buoyed economic growth confidence mr modi powerful prime minister generation sure secure third term office investor looking india yearn political stability many done especially well first year mr modis probusiness leadership even tuesday decline bluechip nifty index nearly tripled since mr modi became prime minister indian market main index entered choppier water way election company namely considered modi stock fared especially poorly election result came view adani group fortune always eyecatching gautam adani rapidly became asia richest man infrastructureoriented business worked harmony mr modis plan country shortsellers report early accused adani group market manipulation accounting fraud adanis stock crashed within year became clear indian government many world biggest bank would patient company climbed back tuesday adani enterprise group flagship company shed percent value putting halfway peak subsequent trough mr modi anyway enough seat form new government albeit much slimmer majority forecast chris wood global head equity strategy jefferies investment bank last year gamed even worse result mr modi saying investor summit october mr modi suddenly defeated would expect percent correction degree correction might welcomed least among professional investor lot market recent growth reflected influx smalltime local investor buying stock first time global investor clamoring access india longterm prospect become nearly impossible find bargain christine phillpotts portfolio manager emerging market ariel investment chicago said india become market everybody love love meant werent many opportunity left even though agreed india economy would keep growing robustly consolation much investor need know government policy favor company india track record suggests economy capable growing rapidly condition vigorous multiparty democracy fastest rate ever clocked achieved previous coalition government growth spurt even mr wood anticipated market decline response mr modis losing ground thought stock would bounce back sharply due momentum india economy whole
nytimes,Early Election Results Suggest Sharp Turnaround for Indian National Congress,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/indian-national-congress-rahul-gandhi-election.html,"In India’s last general election, in 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party won 303 of 543 parliamentary seats — nearly six times as many as the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress. It was a stinging electoral blow for the Congress, a once-dominant party that has appeared greatly diminished in recent years, and exit polls in this year’s election had not suggested it would fare much better. But early election results on Tuesday indicated a far stronger showing than expected for the Congress. The party and its allies were leading in nearly 230 races, a sharp turnaround that prompted jubilation at the Congress headquarters in New Delhi, where supporters erupted in cheers each time a television channel announced a new lead for one of its candidates. “Whatever the final results, one thing is clear — it is a moral victory for Congress and our leader Rahul Gandhi, and defeat for B.J.P.,” said Robin Michael, a political worker, referring to Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. While there was no indication that Congress and the opposition coalition it leads would scrape together a majority to unseat Mr. Modi, party workers said that they had dented Mr. Modi’s aura of invincibility. They praised Mr. Gandhi, the Congress party’s most prominent figure and a great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first post-independence prime minister. Last year, as Mr. Gandhi sought to burnish his standing by leading long marches across India, the B.J.P. ensnared him in a court case that led to his expulsion from Parliament. He was later returned to his seat by India’s highest court. On Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi was on track to win his parliamentary seat in the southern state of Kerala. The Congress, long positioned at India’s political center, has struggled to find a direction and offer an ideological alternative to the Hindu nationalist B.J.P. It has faced rebellions, infighting and periodic fits of soul-searching over whether to rally behind a new face — only to stick with its dynastic leadership. This year, despite expectations, Mr. Gandhi had set a target of doubling the party’s 2019 tally of 52 seats. By late Tuesday afternoon, it was leading in nearly 100 seats. “We will stop Modi from making a mockery of this country and turning people against each other,” said Sandeep Mishra, a Congress worker at party headquarters.

nytimes,Modi’s Party May Need Partners to Form a Government,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/modi-bjp-india-government-coalition.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party will likely need help from junior partners to form a government under the rules of India’s parliamentary system, early election results indicated on Tuesday. In a 2019 election that handed Mr. Modi a second consecutive term, his Bharatiya Janata Party won 303 of the 543 seats in Parliament. That was well over the 272 seats it needed to rule on its own. This time, exit polls released over the weekend suggested that the B.J.P. would once again easily win more than 272 seats. But as of early Tuesday afternoon, official voting results indicated that it would win about 240 seats instead. Winning that much support — 44 percent of the seats in Parliament’s lower house — is an impressive feat in India or any other country. And the new math should not prevent Mr. Modi from securing a third consecutive term as prime minister. But the dip in the B.J.P.’s electoral support, far short of Mr. Modi’s goal and his last electoral performance, will likely have political ramifications. At a minimum, the B.J.P. will have to depend more on the junior members of its existing multiparty alliance. Two of the most prominent parties do not share Mr. Modi’s Hindu-first agenda. And if the governing alliance does not win a majority, the B.J.P. will be able to form a government only by adding new partners. It may not come to that. As of Tuesday afternoon the alliance was on track to scrape by with a narrow parliamentary majority — far short of its target of 400 seats, but enough to stay in power with its existing members.",prime minister narendra modis ruling party likely need help junior partner form government rule india parliamentary system early election result indicated tuesday election handed mr modi second consecutive term bharatiya janata party seat parliament well seat needed rule time exit poll released weekend suggested bjp would easily win seat early tuesday afternoon official voting result indicated would win seat instead winning much support percent seat parliament lower house impressive feat india country new math prevent mr modi securing third consecutive term prime minister dip bjps electoral support far short mr modis goal last electoral performance likely political ramification minimum bjp depend junior member existing multiparty alliance two prominent party share mr modis hindufirst agenda governing alliance win majority bjp able form government adding new partner may come tuesday afternoon alliance track scrape narrow parliamentary majority far short target seat enough stay power existing member
nytimes,How Modi Capitalized on India’s Economic Rise,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-election-economy.html,"Ten years after Narendra Modi was first elected prime minister, India’s economy is roughly twice as large. That is what happens when a country grows at 7 percent a year, as India has been doing, on average, since it opened its markets to international competition in 1991. That steady growth has been skillfully repackaged to promote an image of one man’s leadership making it all happen. Along with nationalism and Hindu pride, the idea that Mr. Modi can make the economy move has been central to his appeal since the beginning. And Mr. Modi has burnished India’s economy in ways that count the most with voters: He made visible infrastructure expansions and distributed welfare benefits to the majority of Indians, who remain poor by global standards even as the country’s higher-income groups learn to flex their spending power. Most of the rest of the world — especially the United States and other Western countries that hope to persuade India to join them in constraining China’s and Russia’s strategic ambitions — wants India’s economy to accelerate. Part of that story could be a shift in manufacturing, like the one Apple has underway in South India. And the world’s investment professionals are eager for India’s successes under Mr. Modi to start paying dividends that they can’t find elsewhere. But even the most eager investors can’t overlook some of the problems that confront India as it becomes the world’s newest heavyweight. While Mr. Modi basked in the glow of a successful moon landing and the country’s innovative “digital public infrastructure,” the political opposition tried to speak past him to the frustrated masses who clamor for more and better jobs. The opposition also tried rousing public anger over Mr. Modi’s ties with the country’s biggest tycoons. That seems not to have worked, neither in politics nor in the markets, in the case of Gautam Adani. Last year the billionaire’s empire was accused, with much flash and fury, of stock manipulation. But the claims hardly broke through, and Adani stocks went back to soaring.",ten year narendra modi first elected prime minister india economy roughly twice large happens country grows percent year india average since opened market international competition steady growth skillfully repackaged promote image one man leadership making happen along nationalism hindu pride idea mr modi make economy move central appeal since beginning mr modi burnished india economy way count voter made visible infrastructure expansion distributed welfare benefit majority indian remain poor global standard even country higherincome group learn flex spending power rest world especially united state western country hope persuade india join constraining china russia strategic ambition want india economy accelerate part story could shift manufacturing like one apple underway south india world investment professional eager india success mr modi start paying dividend cant find elsewhere even eager investor cant overlook problem confront india becomes world newest heavyweight mr modi basked glow successful moon landing country innovative digital public infrastructure political opposition tried speak past frustrated mass clamor better job opposition also tried rousing public anger mr modis tie country biggest tycoon seems worked neither politics market case gautam adani last year billionaire empire accused much flash fury stock manipulation claim hardly broke adani stock went back soaring
nytimes,Man Accused in Plot to Assassinate Sikh Separatist Pleads Not Guilty,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/nyregion/nikhil-gupta-india-assassination-plot.html,"An Indian man pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of orchestrating a failed assassination plot against a Sikh separatist in New York, a plan that prosecutors say he devised on behalf of an unnamed official in India’s government. The defendant, Nikhil Gupta, 52, was arrested in the Czech Republic a year ago, and was extradited last week to make his first appearance in Manhattan federal court. He is accused of trying to arrange the murder of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American citizen and lawyer for a New York-based Sikh secessionist group. The murder attempt, which played out against a backdrop of doubt about India’s commitment to democracy, spanned several countries and mirrored the successful killing of another separatist in Canada, prosecutors say. On Monday morning, Mr. Gupta entered the Lower Manhattan courtroom in a blue cardigan and yellow patterned shirt and appeared relaxed as he spoke to his lawyer, Jeffrey Chabrowe, at the defense table. He has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since landing in the United States on Friday afternoon. In a statement to reporters after the arraignment, Mr. Chabrowe called the case a “complex matter"" for India and the United States. “Background and details will develop that may cast government allegations into an entirely new light,” he said. Mr. Gupta is charged with murder for hire and conspiracy to commit murder for hire. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison for each charge. He was sent back to the detention center after Monday’s arraignment and is set to appear in court again on June 28. In a statement Monday, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said Mr. Gupta will “now face justice” in an American courtroom. “This extradition makes clear that the Justice Department will not tolerate attempts to silence or harm American citizens,” he said. In an indictment unsealed in November, Manhattan federal prosecutors described an audacious plot that began around May 2023 when an Indian government employee enlisted Mr. Gupta to organize the killing of Mr. Pannun, who was living in New York at the time. Mr. Pannun is the general counsel of Sikhs for Justice, an organization that supports the secession of Punjab, a state in northern India. He is a vocal critic of the Indian government and has been banned from the country, prosecutors say. Mr. Gupta, who lived in India, had told the government official about “his involvement in international narcotics and weapons trafficking,” according to the indictment. At the direction of the Indian government employee, Mr. Gupta contacted a man who he believed would help him hire a hit man in New York, but who was, in fact, an agent for the American government. That agent introduced Mr. Gupta to an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration officer who pretended to be the hit man. In deals brokered by Mr. Gupta, the Indian government official agreed to pay the D.E.A. officer $100,000 to kill Mr. Pannun, including a $15,000 cash advance for the job, prosecutors said. Mr. Gupta then shared personal information about Mr. Pannun with the undercover officer, including Mr. Pannun’s address in New York and his phone number. When the Indian official asked for updates, Mr. Gupta relayed surveillance photos of Mr. Pannun that the agent had sent him. Mr. Gupta instructed the undercover officer to carry out the assassination as soon as possible, but asked him not to do it around the time of high-level meetings between U.S. and Indian officials, according to the indictment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington and met with President Biden in June 2023. Then, prosecutors said, on June 18 of that year, gunmen killed Hardeep Singh Nijjar, another Sikh separatist leader, in British Columbia, Canada. Mr. Nijjar knew Mr. Pannun and was also an outspoken critic of the Indian government. Soon after, prosecutors said, Mr. Gupta told the undercover officer that Mr. Nijjar “was also the target” and that “we have so many targets.” Mr. Gupta then told the officer — the pretend hit man — that there was “now no need to wait” to kill Mr. Pannun, prosecutors said. On Monday, Mr. Pannun said in a statement that he had “full faith” that the United States would hold Mr. Gupta and his co-conspirators accountable. “The attempt on my life on American soil is the blatant case of India’s transnational terrorism challenging America’s sovereignty and unequivocally proves that Modi’s India believes in using violence to suppress the dissenting political opinion,” he said. A spokesman for the Indian Embassy in Washington, D.C., could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. Mr. Gupta’s case has threatened to complicate the delicate relations among Washington, Ottawa and New Delhi. During his presidency, Mr. Biden has courted India’s leaders to counter the influence of Russia and China, despite growing concerns about India’s commitment to democracy. Mr. Modi, who has been in office since 2014, was re-elected as India’s prime minister in June, even as his Bharatiya Janata Party lost its majority in Parliament.",indian man pleaded guilty monday charge orchestrating failed assassination plot sikh separatist new york plan prosecutor say devised behalf unnamed official india government defendant nikhil gupta arrested czech republic year ago extradited last week make first appearance manhattan federal court accused trying arrange murder gurpatwant singh pannun american citizen lawyer new yorkbased sikh secessionist group murder attempt played backdrop doubt india commitment democracy spanned several country mirrored successful killing another separatist canada prosecutor say monday morning mr gupta entered lower manhattan courtroom blue cardigan yellow patterned shirt appeared relaxed spoke lawyer jeffrey chabrowe defense table held metropolitan detention center brooklyn since landing united state friday afternoon statement reporter arraignment mr chabrowe called case complex matter india united state background detail develop may cast government allegation entirely new light said mr gupta charged murder hire conspiracy commit murder hire convicted would face maximum year prison charge sent back detention center monday arraignment set appear court june statement monday attorney general merrick b garland said mr gupta face justice american courtroom extradition make clear justice department tolerate attempt silence harm american citizen said indictment unsealed november manhattan federal prosecutor described audacious plot began around may indian government employee enlisted mr gupta organize killing mr pannun living new york time mr pannun general counsel sikh justice organization support secession punjab state northern india vocal critic indian government banned country prosecutor say mr gupta lived india told government official involvement international narcotic weapon trafficking according indictment direction indian government employee mr gupta contacted man believed would help hire hit man new york fact agent american government agent introduced mr gupta undercover drug enforcement administration officer pretended hit man deal brokered mr gupta indian government official agreed pay dea officer kill mr pannun including cash advance job prosecutor said mr gupta shared personal information mr pannun undercover officer including mr pannuns address new york phone number indian official asked update mr gupta relayed surveillance photo mr pannun agent sent mr gupta instructed undercover officer carry assassination soon possible asked around time highlevel meeting u indian official according indictment prime minister narendra modi visited washington met president biden june prosecutor said june year gunman killed hardeep singh nijjar another sikh separatist leader british columbia canada mr nijjar knew mr pannun also outspoken critic indian government soon prosecutor said mr gupta told undercover officer mr nijjar also target many target mr gupta told officer pretend hit man need wait kill mr pannun prosecutor said monday mr pannun said statement full faith united state would hold mr gupta coconspirator accountable attempt life american soil blatant case india transnational terrorism challenging america sovereignty unequivocally prof modis india belief using violence suppress dissenting political opinion said spokesman indian embassy washington dc could immediately reached comment monday mr guptas case threatened complicate delicate relation among washington ottawa new delhi presidency mr biden courted india leader counter influence russia china despite growing concern india commitment democracy mr modi office since reelected india prime minister june even bharatiya janata party lost majority parliament
nytimes,Train Crash in India Leaves at Least 8 Dead and Dozens Injured,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/world/asia/india-train-crash.html,"A freight train collided with a passenger train in eastern India on Monday, killing at least eight people and injuring 50 others, officials said. The episode occurred at around 9 a.m. when the Kanchanjunga Express, which was carrying passengers to the state of West Bengal from the state of Tripura, was leaving the Rangapani station. Four coaches of the popular and often-crowded passenger train derailed when it was rammed from behind by the commercial train. Images from the accident site showed one of the passenger coaches lifted off the railway track and balancing on a coach of the freight train. The death toll was likely to rise. Local news outlets, citing police officials, reported at least 15 people dead. The driver and the assistant driver of the freight train and a guard on the passenger train were among those killed. Jaya Varma Sinha, the chairperson of India’s railway board, said rescue operations were completed. Ashwini Vaishnaw, India’s railway minister, was en route to the site. The relatively low number of casualties could be attributed to the fact that the rear portion of the Kanchanjunga Express, which took the biggest impact from the collision, comprised cargo coaches and the guard’s coach. Passengers were in compartments far forward from the impact. While an investigation has been ordered to look into the cause of the collision, Ms. Sinha said human error such as disregarding a railway signal could have caused the crash. The accident again brings to the fore the issue of rail safety in a country whose millions of poor residents rely on railways for transport. India’s rail network is one of the world’s largest and is crucial to the country’s economy and its people’s lives and livelihood. The country has, in recent years, invested heavily on rail safety after a long history of deadly accidents. Although the overall number of rail accidents has lessened over the past decade, incidents with mass casualties have persisted. Last June, 290 people were killed when two passenger trains collided after one of them struck a stationary freight train at full speed and derailed in the state of Odisha. After that incident, opposition leaders demanded the resignation of Mr. Vaishnaw, the railway minister. He has said he was trying to expand a safety system, called Kavach, that is meant to prevent accidents when two trains are moving on the same track. Ms. Sinha said the technology had not yet been deployed on the route of the Kanchanjunga Express.",freight train collided passenger train eastern india monday killing least eight people injuring others official said episode occurred around kanchanjunga express carrying passenger state west bengal state tripura leaving rangapani station four coach popular oftencrowded passenger train derailed rammed behind commercial train image accident site showed one passenger coach lifted railway track balancing coach freight train death toll likely rise local news outlet citing police official reported least people dead driver assistant driver freight train guard passenger train among killed jaya varma sinha chairperson india railway board said rescue operation completed ashwini vaishnaw india railway minister en route site relatively low number casualty could attributed fact rear portion kanchanjunga express took biggest impact collision comprised cargo coach guard coach passenger compartment far forward impact investigation ordered look cause collision m sinha said human error disregarding railway signal could caused crash accident brings fore issue rail safety country whose million poor resident rely railway transport india rail network one world largest crucial country economy people life livelihood country recent year invested heavily rail safety long history deadly accident although overall number rail accident lessened past decade incident mass casualty persisted last june people killed two passenger train collided one struck stationary freight train full speed derailed state odisha incident opposition leader demanded resignation mr vaishnaw railway minister said trying expand safety system called kavach meant prevent accident two train moving track m sinha said technology yet deployed route kanchanjunga express
nytimes,"G7 Leaders, Expanding the Circle, Shift Focus to Migration and the South","June 14, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/world/europe/g7-summit-ai-china-india.html,"The Group of 7 countries threw open the doors of their club on Friday to India, Brazil, Turkey and other non-Western countries, acknowledging a shifting global landscape as they tried to enlist these nations’ leaders in causes ranging from climate change to managing the economic competition with China. While diplomats from the Group of 7 hammered out a communiqué that pledged support for Ukraine in its war against Russia and greater ambition in curbing carbon emissions, the focus was on Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and other leaders from outside the G7, whose support is increasingly critical to achieving any of these goals. Among the thorny questions on the second day of the summit: migration, which has helped fuel a recent resurgence of populism and far-right parties in Europe and the United States. The leaders also discussed the war in Gaza and China’s state subsidies of industries like electric vehicles, which has prompted the United States and the European Union to impose tariffs on Chinese exports. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, who is hosting the gathering, said the goal of her expanded guest list was to “strengthen dialogue with the nations of the Global South.” She insisted that the Group of 7 was “not a fortress closed in itself” but “an offer of values that we open to the world.” Ms. Meloni recruited Pope Francis to speak to the leaders about the dangers posed by artificial intelligence. Francis urged them to regulate the technology, of which he was himself a victim when A.I.-generated fake images of him clad in a white puffer jacket and a jewel-encrusted crucifix went viral last year. “The benefits and the damages it causes will depend on the way it is used,” the pope declared, warning of the risks of A.I.’s uncontrolled development. He called for lethal autonomous weapons, which are unmanned and uncontrolled by a human hand, to be banned, saying, “No machine should ever decide whether to take the life of a human being away.” The pope’s appearance was the emotional highlight of a day of carefully staged summitry that seemed to concede that the West is less dominant demographically and economically than in the past — and that it is listening to calls for more equity and balance in global decision-making. As Ms. Meloni guided the pope, in a wheelchair, around a circular table to meet the leaders, he was greeted by a visibly moved President Biden and got an enthusiastic hug from Argentina’s flamboyant president, Javier Milei, whose election last November was viewed as another sign of the rising tide of populism across the Americas and Europe. This is not the first time non-Western leaders have been invited to a Group of 7 meeting, but rarely have they been so conspicuous. In part that reflects the issues that Ms. Meloni has highlighted: Africa and the Mediterranean. The leaders of Algeria, Kenya and Tunisia were on hand at a luxury resort hotel on Italy’s southern coast, as was President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. “Inviting key developing country leaders reflects the reality that confronting China and Russia requires the cooperation of more than the G7,” said Daniel M. Price, who was a top trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “And Brazil, India and Turkey are as concerned about Chinese predatory trade practices and overcapacity as are Japan, Europe and the U.S.” The final G7 communiqué voiced concern about what the leaders called China’s “persistent industrial targeting and comprehensive nonmarket policies and practices that are leading to global spillovers, market distortions and harmful overcapacity.” The communiqué endorsed Mr. Biden’s effort to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. France and Canada had pushed for stronger language on Israel’s conduct of the war, according to people familiar with the negotiations, but the United States and Germany resisted. In a victory for Ms. Meloni, a conservative who opposes abortion, the communiqué did not include an explicit reference to abortion, in a passage that pledged to promote “comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.” A communiqué released by the Group of 7 leaders after their last summit in Hiroshima, Japan, referred specifically to abortion rights. The issue injected a briefly discordant note into the gathering after President Emmanuel Macron of France told an Italian journalist that some politicians did not share France’s “vision of equality between women and men.” Ms. Meloni criticized Mr. Macron, who recently called a snap parliamentary election, as seeking to politicize the issue at a “precious forum like the G7.” For the most part, however, the meeting underscored harmony among the leaders, many of whom are embattled by their own domestic politics. It also served as a platform for Ms. Meloni, 47, who has overcome initial qualms about her political roots in a party built on the ashes of fascism to win respect for her steadfast support of Ukraine. Presiding over the two days of meetings, she was able to put a spotlight on several of her pet issues. How to control migration has vexed the United States and Europe, compounded by the effects of climate change and warfare in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Ukraine. It is a particularly delicate issue for Ms. Meloni, who has campaigned hard to fight what she has called “uncontrolled immigration” to Italy and other parts of Europe from Africa and the Middle East. While Europe has welcomed thousands of Ukrainians, especially women and children, fleeing the Russian invasion, Ukrainian officials have urged European countries to help them repatriate men of fighting age. “Turkey is a critical player on global migration,” said Peter Westmacott, who served as Britain’s ambassador to Turkey, France and the United States. He noted that there are about three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds and Afghans. “If Europe wants to control migration from these countries,” Mr. Westmacott said, “Turkey is an indispensable partner.” Mr. Erdogan, he said, could also yet play a role in brokering an end to Ukraine’s war with Russia. As a Black Sea power, Turkey has kept open its commercial and political links to Russia. But it is also a NATO member and has supplied cheap, highly effective drones to help the Ukrainian resistance. Some of the invitations reflected diplomatic protocol, according to Italian officials. Brazil, India and South Africa were automatically included as current or future presidents of the Group of 20 industrialized nations. Argentina was invited, these officials said, because Mr. Milei has recognized the connections and interdependence between East and West. He and Ms. Meloni have also cultivated close personal ties, sharing a right-wing populism that includes opposition to abortion and gay rights.",group country threw open door club friday india brazil turkey nonwestern country acknowledging shifting global landscape tried enlist nation leader cause ranging climate change managing economic competition china diplomat group hammered communiqu pledged support ukraine war russia greater ambition curbing carbon emission focus prime minister narendra modi india president luiz incio lula da silva brazil leader outside g whose support increasingly critical achieving goal among thorny question second day summit migration helped fuel recent resurgence populism farright party europe united state leader also discussed war gaza china state subsidy industry like electric vehicle prompted united state european union impose tariff chinese export prime minister giorgia meloni italy hosting gathering said goal expanded guest list strengthen dialogue nation global south insisted group fortress closed offer value open world m meloni recruited pope francis speak leader danger posed artificial intelligence francis urged regulate technology victim aigenerated fake image clad white puffer jacket jewelencrusted crucifix went viral last year benefit damage cause depend way used pope declared warning risk ai uncontrolled development called lethal autonomous weapon unmanned uncontrolled human hand banned saying machine ever decide whether take life human away pope appearance emotional highlight day carefully staged summitry seemed concede west le dominant demographically economically past listening call equity balance global decisionmaking m meloni guided pope wheelchair around circular table meet leader greeted visibly moved president biden got enthusiastic hug argentina flamboyant president javier milei whose election last november viewed another sign rising tide populism across america europe first time nonwestern leader invited group meeting rarely conspicuous part reflects issue m meloni highlighted africa mediterranean leader algeria kenya tunisia hand luxury resort hotel italy southern coast president recep tayyip erdogan turkey inviting key developing country leader reflects reality confronting china russia requires cooperation g said daniel price top trade adviser president george w bush brazil india turkey concerned chinese predatory trade practice overcapacity japan europe u final g communiqu voiced concern leader called china persistent industrial targeting comprehensive nonmarket policy practice leading global spillover market distortion harmful overcapacity communiqu endorsed mr bidens effort broker ceasefire israel hamas gaza france canada pushed stronger language israel conduct war according people familiar negotiation united state germany resisted victory m meloni conservative opposes abortion communiqu include explicit reference abortion passage pledged promote comprehensive sexual reproductive health right communiqu released group leader last summit hiroshima japan referred specifically abortion right issue injected briefly discordant note gathering president emmanuel macron france told italian journalist politician share france vision equality woman men m meloni criticized mr macron recently called snap parliamentary election seeking politicize issue precious forum like g part however meeting underscored harmony among leader many embattled domestic politics also served platform m meloni overcome initial qualm political root party built ash fascism win respect steadfast support ukraine presiding two day meeting able put spotlight several pet issue control migration vexed united state europe compounded effect climate change warfare afghanistan middle east ukraine particularly delicate issue m meloni campaigned hard fight called uncontrolled immigration italy part europe africa middle east europe welcomed thousand ukrainian especially woman child fleeing russian invasion ukrainian official urged european country help repatriate men fighting age turkey critical player global migration said peter westmacott served britain ambassador turkey france united state noted three million syrian refugee turkey well hundred thousand iraqi kurd afghan europe want control migration country mr westmacott said turkey indispensable partner mr erdogan said could also yet play role brokering end ukraine war russia black sea power turkey kept open commercial political link russia also nato member supplied cheap highly effective drone help ukrainian resistance invitation reflected diplomatic protocol according italian official brazil india south africa automatically included current future president group industrialized nation argentina invited official said mr milei recognized connection interdependence east west m meloni also cultivated close personal tie sharing rightwing populism includes opposition abortion gay right
nytimes,Fire in Kuwait Worker Housing Leaves at Least 49 Dead,"June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/world/middleeast/fire-kuwait-migrant-worker-housing.html,"At least 49 people were killed and dozens of others injured in the Persian Gulf country of Kuwait, the state news agency said, when a fire broke out on Wednesday in a building that housed scores of low-income workers, many of them Indian nationals. The fire began during the morning in a coastal area called Mangaf, about half an hour’s drive from the center of the capital, Kuwait City. The Kuwaiti authorities have held the building owner for questioning as they investigate the cause of the fire and try to determine whether “any shortcoming or neglect” played a role, the state news agency reported. The authorities promised to begin a campaign to tackle building code violations. The public prosecutor’s office also planned to inspect the site and interview survivors. Speaking to journalists at the site of the fire, Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Al Sabah — Kuwait’s deputy prime minister and interior minister — blamed “the greed of property owners” for the disaster and said that the owner of the company employing the workers would also be detained, the Reuters news agency and Kuwaiti newspapers reported. Jayashankar, an Indian salesman who survived the fire, said that he awoke to screams around 4 a.m. local time. He and his roommates opened the door to their fourth-floor apartment and found that thick black smoke had enveloped the corridor, burning their lungs, he said in a phone interview, asking to be identified by his first name only for fear of retribution. Instead of trying to escape, he said, they locked the door, opened a window and waited for help. Two of his roommates who left the apartment to find an exit later died, he said. Witnesses told local news outlets that the fire had begun at the bottom of the seven-story building, sending smoke billowing upward. In a televised interview, an official in Kuwait’s firefighting force, Col. Sayed Hassan Al-Moussawi, said, “In a building like this, you’re supposed to go up to the roof, but unfortunately the door to the roof was locked.” Ramesh, an Indian worker who lives in a building next door and who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said in an interview that he saw people trying to jump out of windows to escape. The fire’s high death toll highlighted the perils faced by low-income immigrants to Gulf countries, who often toil under exploitative contracts and live in overcrowded housing, with regulatory protections that are limited or poorly enforced. Foreigners make up about two-thirds of the population of Kuwait, an oil-rich nation with one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds. Many are low-paid workers from South Asian countries who perform jobs including construction, restaurant service and street cleaning. More than 50 people hurt during the fire were sent to hospitals around Kuwait, with injuries including burns, broken bones from jumping out of the building and carbon monoxide poisoning from smoke inhalation, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. Nine were in critical condition, it said. Many of the workers affected were from India, the country’s embassy in Kuwait said on social media. On Wednesday, India’s ambassador to Kuwait, Adarsh Swaika, visited several hospitals where workers were taken, the embassy said in its posts. In a post on X, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India said that the fire was “saddening” and that the Indian Embassy would monitor the situation closely and work with the authorities “to assist the affected.” In a video published by the Kuwaiti news media, Sheikh Fahad was shown at the location of the fire, questioning an unidentified man about who lived in the building. The man told him that 196 people had lived there. The video cut off after Sheikh Fahad told the authorities to detain the man for questioning. Officials working in the municipality overseeing the area were also suspended from work pending an investigation, Kuwait’s state news agency reported. Building codes in Gulf countries are often laxly put in place, and smoke detectors and fire escapes are not common in residential properties. At the site of the fire on Wednesday afternoon, municipal employees were already putting up notices of violations on nearby buildings, including for partitioning rooms with gypsum board. Mangaf is predominantly inhabited by migrant workers, with apartment blocks housing men from India, Bangladesh and Egypt. Interviewed by The New York Times near the fire location, workers who lived nearby gave varying accounts of the numbers of men typically housed in each room, ranging from three to 12. Jayashankar, the survivor, said that nine people, all Indians, had shared his three-bedroom apartment. The building bore a sign saying it was a workers’ camp for a company called NBTC Group, a contracting firm headquartered in Kuwait with business in construction, industry, logistics and related fields. Phone calls to the company on Wednesday went unanswered, and an employee at the company’s offices said that staff members had been detained by officials that day. Another Indian worker who lived on the second floor of the building said that he and his roommates had survived because they had been out working an overnight shift. The worker, Sami, 45, who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said he had not yet been able to go inside to retrieve his belongings and inspect the damage because the police had closed off entrances to the building. Shahrukh Kha, who is from Bihar, India, said that he had spent all day trying to reach his brother, Kalu, who lived in the building, but that his brother’s phone was off. “We have not gotten any kind of information about whether he is injured or dead,” he said in a phone interview. Kalu Kha, a 30-year-old salesman who works in a fruit and vegetable shop, had been planning to travel home to India next month, his brother said; his wedding date is set for July 22.",least people killed dozen others injured persian gulf country kuwait state news agency said fire broke wednesday building housed score lowincome worker many indian national fire began morning coastal area called mangaf half hour drive center capital kuwait city kuwaiti authority held building owner questioning investigate cause fire try determine whether shortcoming neglect played role state news agency reported authority promised begin campaign tackle building code violation public prosecutor office also planned inspect site interview survivor speaking journalist site fire sheikh fahad yusuf al sabah kuwait deputy prime minister interior minister blamed greed property owner disaster said owner company employing worker would also detained reuters news agency kuwaiti newspaper reported jayashankar indian salesman survived fire said awoke scream around local time roommate opened door fourthfloor apartment found thick black smoke enveloped corridor burning lung said phone interview asking identified first name fear retribution instead trying escape said locked door opened window waited help two roommate left apartment find exit later died said witness told local news outlet fire begun bottom sevenstory building sending smoke billowing upward televised interview official kuwait firefighting force col sayed hassan almoussawi said building like youre supposed go roof unfortunately door roof locked ramesh indian worker life building next door also asked identified first name fear retribution said interview saw people trying jump window escape fire high death toll highlighted peril faced lowincome immigrant gulf country often toil exploitative contract live overcrowded housing regulatory protection limited poorly enforced foreigner make twothirds population kuwait oilrich nation one world largest sovereign wealth fund many lowpaid worker south asian country perform job including construction restaurant service street cleaning people hurt fire sent hospital around kuwait injury including burn broken bone jumping building carbon monoxide poisoning smoke inhalation ministry health said statement nine critical condition said many worker affected india country embassy kuwait said social medium wednesday india ambassador kuwait adarsh swaika visited several hospital worker taken embassy said post post x prime minister narendra modi india said fire saddening indian embassy would monitor situation closely work authority assist affected video published kuwaiti news medium sheikh fahad shown location fire questioning unidentified man lived building man told people lived video cut sheikh fahad told authority detain man questioning official working municipality overseeing area also suspended work pending investigation kuwait state news agency reported building code gulf country often laxly put place smoke detector fire escape common residential property site fire wednesday afternoon municipal employee already putting notice violation nearby building including partitioning room gypsum board mangaf predominantly inhabited migrant worker apartment block housing men india bangladesh egypt interviewed new york time near fire location worker lived nearby gave varying account number men typically housed room ranging three jayashankar survivor said nine people indian shared threebedroom apartment building bore sign saying worker camp company called nbtc group contracting firm headquartered kuwait business construction industry logistics related field phone call company wednesday went unanswered employee company office said staff member detained official day another indian worker lived second floor building said roommate survived working overnight shift worker sami also asked identified first name fear retribution said yet able go inside retrieve belonging inspect damage police closed entrance building shahrukh kha bihar india said spent day trying reach brother kalu lived building brother phone gotten kind information whether injured dead said phone interview kalu kha yearold salesman work fruit vegetable shop planning travel home india next month brother said wedding date set july
nytimes,"At the Ambani Wedding Celebrations, a Dazzling Display of Jewels","June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/fashion/weddings/ambani-jewels.html,"When Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India abruptly changed her country’s constitution in 1971 and abolished the Privy Purse, a government allowance for the country’s former princely rulers, she also moved to nationalize their storied treasuries. Among the maharajahs, nizams and nabobs that once ruled the subcontinent, this set off a frenzy as they scurried to bury the family jewels. For centuries, the rarity, scale and grandeur of Indian jewels was so great that many became iconic objects. Take the Patiala Necklace, a tiered ornament resembling draperies of gems. Designed by Cartier, it featured an astounding 2,930 diamonds and centered on a single rock the size of a walnut. Or consider the Indore Pears, two stupendous and closely matched diamonds owned by Maharajah Yeshwant Rao Holkar II, a glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom was in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Indian princely patronage long set a global standard of splendor for both artistry and ostentation in the jewel trade. Yet in the decades after the Privy Purse, most of the big rocks seemed to have vanished underground. Legend has it that members of formerly royal families stashed their jewels in Swiss vaults, pawned them on the black market or hid them in flower pots. Bling on a royal scale largely disappeared. Or so it seemed until a fresh cadre of princes heaved into view: oligarchs. The richest of these by orders of magnitude is Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of his family’s megacompany Reliance Industries. Mr. Ambani’s personal fortune is estimated by Forbes at a staggering $115 billion. Despite his vast wealth, few outside India had heard of him — that is, until March 1, when he hosted a three-day party to celebrate his son Anant’s wedding in July. Everything about the prewedding affair was on a princely scale: the guest list of 1,000, including boldface names like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump; a glass palace specially constructed in the Ambani’s hometown, Jamnagar, in the western state of Gujarat; and Rihanna’s first public performance in years. Rihanna’s reported $6 million payday hogged the headlines, but what lit up at least one obsessive corner of the internet was the Ambani jewelry. This included necklaces and earrings and rings and hair ornaments of a size and grandeur seldom seen publicly since the days of the Raj. “It was almost like the time of maharajahs 100 years down the line,” said Pramod Kumar, an archivist and a founder of the museum consultancy EKA. He is also keeper of topophilia.india, an erudite Instagram account that is catnip for Indophile aesthetes. Mr. Kumar’s sleuth work traced a possible source of the two most gobsmacking gems seen at the Ambani prewedding celebration: massive step-cut Colombian emeralds roughly the size of Popsicles. Draped one below the other as pendants to a diamond necklace, they were worn one evening by the bridegroom’s mother, Nita Ambani. The bigger one was “of 562 carats,” Mr. Kumar wrote in an Instagram post, adding that the weight of the smaller stone was a mere 303 carats. Whatever their source, those emeralds were just two among many gems on display throughout an event at which the jewels often had greater star power than their wearers. “That emerald necklace was what caught everyone’s attention at first, but it was all almost unfathomable,” said Stellene Volandes, the editor in chief of Town & Country. She noted the scarcity represented by ropes of the rarest natural pearls from the Arabian Sea; necklaces in the heavy, ornate rani haar style studded with diamonds; and headpieces known as maang tikka, made with deep green emeralds from the storied Muzo mines. “You’d be very hard-pressed to find comparables for the sheer size and horsepower” of the jewels at the Ambani prewedding party, said Nico Landrigan, the president of the Verdura jewelry house in New York. “The Indians are a jewelry-obsessed culture in a category all their own. So you can only imagine what the actual wedding will bring out.” Before the wedding, scheduled for July 12 to 14 in Mumbai, there was yet another lavish preparatory celebration and opportunity to flaunt big rocks — a cruise from the Tyrrhenian Sea in Palermo, Italy, to the Mediterranean in Cannes, France, on an ocean liner whose 2,400 staterooms had been retrofitted for the Ambanis as three-bedroom suites for 800 invited guests. “Basically, what the Ambanis are doing is displaying a kind of old-style Hollywood glam,” said Mr. Kumar of EKA. “You don’t see that with any other current billionaire moguls in Europe or America, at least not in the public realm.” For Daniela Mascetti, the former chairwoman of Sotheby’s jewelry division in Europe and an author of “Understanding Jewelry,” a bible of the trade, the group more aptly compared to the Ambanis is the robber barons of the Industrial Age. “You have to look back to Vanderbilt or Gould, who also wanted big door-stoppers,” Ms. Mascetti said from London. “Let’s put it in a nice way,” she added. “If you are new money and you want to display wealth, you go big.” Yet it is not altogether that simple. Certain Ambani jewels were crafted using the whopper stones, but that is not to suggest that the determining factor in commissioning them was size. “There is tremendous artistry in the work,” said Ms. Volandes of Town & Country. Much of the Ambani jewels were designed by Viren Bhagat, among the more refined high jewelers, though also an assiduously private one. More than the size of individual stones like the stepped-cut emeralds, few save a detective like Mr. Kumar could predict their origins. “Being one-off is of the greatest importance in that world,” Francesca Amfitheatrof, the creative director of high jewelry and watches at Louis Vuitton, said recently from St.-Tropez, France, where she was debuting her latest collection. “To be able to source things that are so unique and outstanding, honestly, only an emperor has that possibility anymore,” she said. “It’s completely maharajah-like. It’s imperial.”",prime minister indira gandhi india abruptly changed country constitution abolished privy purse government allowance country former princely ruler also moved nationalize storied treasury among maharajah nizams nabob ruled subcontinent set frenzy scurried bury family jewel century rarity scale grandeur indian jewel great many became iconic object take patiala necklace tiered ornament resembling drapery gem designed cartier featured astounding diamond centered single rock size walnut consider indore pear two stupendous closely matched diamond owned maharajah yeshwant rao holkar ii glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom central indian state madhya pradesh indian princely patronage long set global standard splendor artistry ostentation jewel trade yet decade privy purse big rock seemed vanished underground legend member formerly royal family stashed jewel swiss vault pawned black market hid flower pot bling royal scale largely disappeared seemed fresh cadre prince heaved view oligarch richest order magnitude mukesh ambani chairman family megacompany reliance industry mr ambanis personal fortune estimated forbes staggering billion despite vast wealth outside india heard march hosted threeday party celebrate son anants wedding july everything prewedding affair princely scale guest list including boldface name like mark zuckerberg bill gate ivanka trump glass palace specially constructed ambanis hometown jamnagar western state gujarat rihannas first public performance year rihannas reported million payday hogged headline lit least one obsessive corner internet ambani jewelry included necklace earring ring hair ornament size grandeur seldom seen publicly since day raj almost like time maharajah year line said pramod kumar archivist founder museum consultancy eka also keeper topophiliaindia erudite instagram account catnip indophile aesthete mr kumars sleuth work traced possible source two gobsmacking gem seen ambani prewedding celebration massive stepcut colombian emerald roughly size popsicle draped one pendant diamond necklace worn one evening bridegroom mother nita ambani bigger one carat mr kumar wrote instagram post adding weight smaller stone mere carat whatever source emerald two among many gem display throughout event jewel often greater star power wearer emerald necklace caught everyones attention first almost unfathomable said stellene volandes editor chief town country noted scarcity represented rope rarest natural pearl arabian sea necklace heavy ornate rani haar style studded diamond headpiece known maang tikka made deep green emerald storied muzo mine youd hardpressed find comparables sheer size horsepower jewel ambani prewedding party said nico landrigan president verdura jewelry house new york indian jewelryobsessed culture category imagine actual wedding bring wedding scheduled july mumbai yet another lavish preparatory celebration opportunity flaunt big rock cruise tyrrhenian sea palermo italy mediterranean cannes france ocean liner whose stateroom retrofitted ambanis threebedroom suite invited guest basically ambanis displaying kind oldstyle hollywood glam said mr kumar eka dont see current billionaire mogul europe america least public realm daniela mascetti former chairwoman sothebys jewelry division europe author understanding jewelry bible trade group aptly compared ambanis robber baron industrial age look back vanderbilt gould also wanted big doorstopper m mascetti said london let put nice way added new money want display wealth go big yet altogether simple certain ambani jewel crafted using whopper stone suggest determining factor commissioning size tremendous artistry work said m volandes town country much ambani jewel designed viren bhagat among refined high jeweler though also assiduously private one size individual stone like steppedcut emerald save detective like mr kumar could predict origin oneoff greatest importance world francesca amfitheatrof creative director high jewelry watch louis vuitton said recently sttropez france debuting latest collection able source thing unique outstanding honestly emperor possibility anymore said completely maharajahlike imperial

nytimes,"India-Pakistan Cricket World Cup Match Brings 34,000 Fans to Long Island","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/nyregion/india-pakistan-cricket-world-cup.html,"Normally at this time of year, the grassy southeastern corner of Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, N.Y., is a place for softball games, family picnics and a few cricket players enjoying a warm weekend afternoon. On Sunday, that space was transformed into a stage for one of the most-watched global sporting events of the year. More than 34,000 fans and cricket dignitaries squeezed into a temporary stadium built in the last three months in the Long Island park to watch the most anticipated match of the T20 Cricket World Cup: India versus Pakistan. For about three hours, fans in blue and orange India shirts mingled with their (vastly outnumbered) rivals in the dark green of Pakistan, producing a festive and vibrant atmosphere. They roared at every big play, shouting and waving signs and flags. They ate South Asian food sold at the concession stands, jumped, chanted, high-fived with fellow supporters and — after a bit of rain — soaked up the sunshine on a historic day at the usually quiet park. “It was electric,” said Chandu Talla, an India fan and entrepreneur from Tampa, Fla., who came to the match with his son Aryan, a high school junior. “We paid $2,500 per ticket and no regrets,” he added. “It was a dream come true to see India here.” After a slow start, India came back strong to win, and when Pakistan’s Naseem Shah hit the last ball from India bowler Arshdeep Singh, the India fans erupted in cheers. “It was pretty good,” said India bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who was named the player of the match. “Always, when India and Pakistan play, a lot of emotion does come in. It did feel like we had a lot of support.” People in the New York area may have been mostly oblivious to it, but any match between India and Pakistan, two of the greatest cricketing nations, is a monumental event, at least in South Asia and other cricket-loving parts of the world. The previous time the teams played, last fall, viewership reached 398 million in India alone, according to the International Cricket Council. (This year’s Super Bowl had 123 million viewers.) Sunday’s attendance (34,028) constituted the largest at an international cricket match in the United States, according to the I.C.C. Attendees included such cricketing legends as Yuvraj Singh of India, Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi and Australia’s Ricky Ponting. For Omar Minaya, the Yankees’ special adviser and the former general manager of the Mets, the cricket match was his first. “It’s amazing,” he said. “The atmosphere is great. It’s like the World Baseball Classic, or the Dominican Baseball League.” The T20 World Cup, held every two years, is a 20-nation tournament featuring a shorter form of cricket. This year, for the first time, the event is being held in the United States and several Caribbean nations where cricket is revered. The U.S. matches are also being held in Dallas and Lauderhill, Fla., but New York was designated for the marquee matchup. Cricket is part of the cultural fabric in both India and Pakistan, but political tensions over the decades have forced the countries to play each other in other places. “Oh, it’s contentious, a real battle of sentiments,” said Narinder Kapoor, 84, a retired U.S. Treasury Department agent, originally from New Delhi. “When these countries play, it’s a real hot potato.” A former amateur cricket player who emigrated to Syosset, N.Y., in 1972, Mr. Kapoor had not seen a cricket match live since 1974, although he watches the sport constantly on TV. He went to the game between Ireland and Canada on Friday and had hoped to attend Sunday’s big encounter, but his knees were ailing him, so he stayed home, according to his son, Sandeep Kapoor. The elder Mr. Kapoor said that he enjoyed the sparsely attended match on Friday, but added that the temporary stadium did not have enough accommodations for people with disabilities and that it was difficult for older people to ascend the steps. “But once you are inside, the field and the view is excellent,” he said. “World class.” Security was tight for the match, especially after a website purportedly affiliated with the terrorist organization ISIS called for attacks on the event. Mounted police, SWAT units, sniffer dogs, helicopters and large numbers of police officers swarmed the area, and long lines formed at entrances as people went through security scanners. Bruce Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, said that the I.C.C. had defrayed some of the cost of the security, which he said included local, state and federal agencies, including the F.B.I. “I want to commend the fans,” Mr. Blakeman said, adding, “Everybody has been so polite and respectful, and they followed instructions so they could be safe and healthy.” There was at least one exception. An airplane trailing a sign that said “Release Imran Khan” breached restricted airspace over the stadium before the match. (Mr. Khan, a former Pakistani cricket star and former prime minister of Pakistan, is serving a prison sentence there.) Mr. Blakeman said the plane was eventually intercepted. The mood at the park was generally upbeat, even for Pakistan fans on the losing end. “India-Pakistan is a very big deal,” said Temu Martin, an airfreight transport official from New Jersey and a Pakistan supporter. “But it’s not war. It’s a game.” He said that after Pakistan lost to the United States last week in a major upset in Dallas, ticket prices for Sunday’s match in East Meadow plummeted from over $2,000 to $600. He said he was planning to travel to Barbados for Pakistan’s next match and then to attend a knockout-stage match in Antigua. There are three more matches scheduled in New York, with the final one on Wednesday between India and the United States. The stadium will then be dismantled and the pieces sent out to other sporting events around the country. Mr. Blakeman predicted that Nassau County would make $150 million on the eight New York games of the tournament — 10 times what the county spent on infrastructure, planning and security, he said. Cricket officials had told him that there could be as many as 600 million viewers worldwide for Sunday’s match, he added. He said that he had heard from investors who want to bring the sport, perhaps with New York’s franchise in Major League Cricket, to Nassau County. “The way things have gone here these last couple of weeks, I think cricket has found a home,” Mr. Blakeman said.",normally time year grassy southeastern corner eisenhower park east meadow ny place softball game family picnic cricket player enjoying warm weekend afternoon sunday space transformed stage one mostwatched global sporting event year fan cricket dignitary squeezed temporary stadium built last three month long island park watch anticipated match cricket world cup india versus pakistan three hour fan blue orange india shirt mingled vastly outnumbered rival dark green pakistan producing festive vibrant atmosphere roared every big play shouting waving sign flag ate south asian food sold concession stand jumped chanted highfived fellow supporter bit rain soaked sunshine historic day usually quiet park electric said chandu talla india fan entrepreneur tampa fla came match son aryan high school junior paid per ticket regret added dream come true see india slow start india came back strong win pakistan naseem shah hit last ball india bowler arshdeep singh india fan erupted cheer pretty good said india bowler jasprit bumrah named player match always india pakistan play lot emotion come feel like lot support people new york area may mostly oblivious match india pakistan two greatest cricketing nation monumental event least south asia cricketloving part world previous time team played last fall viewership reached million india alone according international cricket council year super bowl million viewer sunday attendance constituted largest international cricket match united state according icc attendee included cricketing legend yuvraj singh india pakistan shahid afridi australia ricky ponting omar minaya yankee special adviser former general manager mets cricket match first amazing said atmosphere great like world baseball classic dominican baseball league world cup held every two year nation tournament featuring shorter form cricket year first time event held united state several caribbean nation cricket revered u match also held dallas lauderhill fla new york designated marquee matchup cricket part cultural fabric india pakistan political tension decade forced country play place oh contentious real battle sentiment said narinder kapoor retired u treasury department agent originally new delhi country play real hot potato former amateur cricket player emigrated syosset ny mr kapoor seen cricket match live since although watch sport constantly tv went game ireland canada friday hoped attend sunday big encounter knee ailing stayed home according son sandeep kapoor elder mr kapoor said enjoyed sparsely attended match friday added temporary stadium enough accommodation people disability difficult older people ascend step inside field view excellent said world class security tight match especially website purportedly affiliated terrorist organization isi called attack event mounted police swat unit sniffer dog helicopter large number police officer swarmed area long line formed entrance people went security scanner bruce blakeman nassau county executive said icc defrayed cost security said included local state federal agency including fbi want commend fan mr blakeman said adding everybody polite respectful followed instruction could safe healthy least one exception airplane trailing sign said release imran khan breached restricted airspace stadium match mr khan former pakistani cricket star former prime minister pakistan serving prison sentence mr blakeman said plane eventually intercepted mood park generally upbeat even pakistan fan losing end indiapakistan big deal said temu martin airfreight transport official new jersey pakistan supporter war game said pakistan lost united state last week major upset dallas ticket price sunday match east meadow plummeted said planning travel barbados pakistan next match attend knockoutstage match antigua three match scheduled new york final one wednesday india united state stadium dismantled piece sent sporting event around country mr blakeman predicted nassau county would make million eight new york game tournament time county spent infrastructure planning security said cricket official told could many million viewer worldwide sunday match added said heard investor want bring sport perhaps new york franchise major league cricket nassau county way thing gone last couple week think cricket found home mr blakeman said
nytimes,"Modi, Striking a Modest Tone, Is Sworn In for a Third Term","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/world/asia/india-changed-modi-swearing-in.html,"As a humbled Narendra Modi was sworn in on Sunday for a third term as India’s prime minister, the political air in New Delhi appeared transformed. The election that ended last week stripped Mr. Modi of his parliamentary majority and forced him to turn to a diverse set of coalition partners to stay in power. Now, these other parties are enjoying something that for years was singularly Mr. Modi’s: relevance and the spotlight. Their leaders have been swarmed by TV crews while on their way to present demands and policy opinions to Mr. Modi. His opponents, too, have been getting more airtime, with stations cutting live to their news conferences, something almost unheard-of in recent years. Above all, the change can be seen in Mr. Modi himself. For now, at least, the messianic air is gone. He pitches himself as the modest administrator that voters showed they wanted. “To run the government, a majority is necessary. But to run the nation, a consensus is necessary,” Mr. Modi said in a speech on Friday to members of his coalition ahead of his swearing in. “The people want us to deliver better than before.” A visibly emotional Mr. Modi took the oath of office on Sunday evening, only the second prime minister to be elected for a third consecutive term in the seven decades of India’s republic. The ceremony, at the country’s presidential palace, was attended by about 8,000 supporters and dignitaries, including the leaders of India’s neighboring nations. To many, Mr. Modi’s shift in approach can mean only good things for the country’s democracy — a move toward moderation in a hugely diverse nation that was being whipped into a Hindu-first monolith in the image of one man. The question is whether Mr. Modi can truly become something he has not been during his two-plus decades in elected office: a consensus builder. “He is a pragmatic politician and, for his own survival and for the survival of his party, he will be a little mellowed,” said Ashutosh, a New Delhi-based analyst who uses only one name and is the author of a book on how Indian politics have changed under Mr. Modi. “But to assume a qualitative change in his style of governance is expecting too much.” A trademark of Mr. Modi’s leadership in recent years has been the use of power levers at his disposal — from pressure of police cases to the lure of a share in power and its perks — to break his opponents and get them to switch to his side. A bruised governing party may well try such tactics to peel away some lawmakers to his side, analyst say, to buttress his place at the top. But in the days leading up to the swearing-in, a change in approach was evident. When members of the new coalition packed into the hall of India’s old Parliament building on Friday for deliberations on forming the government, every time a senior ally seated next to him stood up to start his speech, Mr. Modi also stood up. When it was time for Mr. Modi to be garlanded as the coalition’s choice for prime minister, he waited for the leaders of the two main coalition partners to arrive by his side before the congratulatory wreath of purple orchids was placed around his neck. His hourlong address contained none of his usual references to himself in the third person. His tone was measured. He focused on the coalition’s promise of “good governance” and “the dream of a developed India,” and he acknowledged that things would be different from the past 10 years. The last time Mr. Modi came to the Parliament complex for a closely watched event, last May when he inaugurated a new, more modern building for the assembly, he made an entrance some observers compared with that of a king: with markings on his forehead as a sign of piety and a scepter in his hand, as shirtless, chanting Hindu monks walked ahead of and behind him. This time, he went straight to a copy of the Constitution, which declares that India is a secular and socialist democracy, bowing before it and lifting it to his forehead. For the first time in his more than two decades in elected office, Mr. Modi finds himself in uncharted territory. Until now, as long as he has been at the helm — whether at the state level as the chief minister of Gujarat or at the national level — his Bharatiya Janata Party has always had a majority. Analysts say that history of never having been in the opposition has shaped his heavy-handed approach to politics. When he left Gujarat, after 13 years, he had established such a firm grip and had so routed the opposition that the state had effectively become one of single-party rule. His first national victory in 2014, with a majority for his B.J.P., ended decades of coalition governance in India, in which no party had been able to capture the 272 seats in Parliament necessary for a majority. In 2019, he was re-elected with an even bigger majority. Mr. Modi’s enormous power helped swiftly carry out what had for decades been his right-wing party’s agenda, including construction of a lavish Hindu temple on a long-disputed site that once held a mosque, and the revocation of the special status long enjoyed by the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir. A separatist insurgency has long troubled the Himalayan Kashmir region. As the inauguration ceremony began in New Delhi on Sunday, a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims in the Reasi district fell into a gorge after gunmen opened fire on it. At least eight people were killed, the police said. A trademark of Mr. Modi’s governance was a disregard for parliamentary procedures and for debates on legislation. His unexpected, overnight demonetization in 2016 — which invalidated India’s currency in an effort to crack down on corruption — threw the country into chaos and dealt a blow to a still cash-driven economy. Similarly, rushing to enact laws aimed at overhauling the agriculture market resulted in a year of protests that choked Delhi, forcing Mr. Modi to retreat. Before the election results came out, Mr. Modi’s party had predicted that his coalition would win 400 seats in India’s 543-seat Parliament. The opposition would be reduced to sitting “in the spectators’ gallery,” Mr. Modi said. Officials in his government had made clear that in his new term he would seek to put in place the only main item remaining on his party’s agenda: legislating a “uniform civil code” across this diverse country to replace varying laws of different religions that currently govern issues like marriage and inheritance. His party leaders spoke of Mr. Modi not only as their leader for the current term, but also for the next election in 2029, when he would be 78. “He has been trying to transform the country,” Sudesh Verma, a B.J.P. official who wrote a book on Mr. Modi’s rise, said in an interview before the election results were announced. “I look forward to him working like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, who worked into his 90s.” But under a coalition government, Mr. Modi’s traditional approach will be difficult. Two of the main coalition parties that helped him achieve the minimum number of Parliament seats to form a government are secular, in contrast to Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist ideology. N. Chandrababu Naidu, whose party holds 16 seats, has been scathing in the past in his criticism of Mr. Modi’s treatment of the Muslim minority. He has also openly criticized Mr. Modi for using the central investigating agencies to target his opponents and taking “steps to subvert all democratic institutions.” Neerja Chowdhury, a political analyst in Delhi and the author of the 2023 book “How Prime Ministers Decide,” said, “The contentious ideological issues, like the enactment of the uniform civil code, may be put on the back burner if the allies are not comfortable with it.” Mr. Modi’s popular image is built on two strong pillars. He is a champion of economic development, with an inspiring biography of a rise from a humble caste and relative poverty. He is also a lifelong Hindu nationalist, with decades as a foot soldier in a movement seeking to turn India’s secular and diverse state into an overtly Hindu-first place. At the peak of his power, the Hindu nationalist aspect increasingly dominated. Analysts say that the recent rebuke by voters might be a lucky break for the nation: prompting Mr. Modi to tap into his development champion side, and to focus on a legacy of economic transformation that could improve the lives of all Indians.",humbled narendra modi sworn sunday third term india prime minister political air new delhi appeared transformed election ended last week stripped mr modi

nytimes,"India’s Modi, Humbled by Voters, Faces Potent Economic Struggles","June 7, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/business/india-election-modi-economy.html,"Before the Indian election results emerged this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was widely viewed as a charismatic and popular strongman celebrated by the business world for elevating its importance, even as he failed to solve a vexing problem: how to turn swift economic growth into critically needed jobs. After the election, Mr. Modi finds himself staring at that same monumental puzzle, yet relegated to an uncomfortable new status. He is the head of a party that has been chastened at the polls, forcing him to forge a coalition to maintain power. Mr. Modi’s governing authority is likely to be constrained by the complexities of keeping his coalition partners on his side. He could not solve India’s most deep-seated economic challenge when he wielded a monopolistic hold on power. Now, he is a weakened leader who must balance additional interests, while still lacking an obvious way to improve living standards. “There has been a sense that employment growth has been weak in the last four, five years,” said Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic adviser to the Modi administration, who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “How do you create more jobs? This is really India’s central economic challenge, but I think the government will find itself with relatively limited tools.” The humbling of Mr. Modi’s party resonates in part as an expression of popular frustration that India remains a land of economic peril for hundreds of millions of people, as well as a country defined by astonishing contrasts in wealth. In major cities, five-star hotels boasting sumptuous spas look down on teeming slums that lack plumbing. In rural areas, malnutrition prevails under many roofs, and families struggle to find the money to keep children in school. Though its working-age population numbers roughly one billion, India has only 430 million jobs, according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, an independent research institution in Mumbai. And most of those counted as employed are stuck in precarious circumstances as day laborers and farm hands, lacking reliable wages and government workplace protections. Improved livelihoods are evident in many cities, from the high-rise apartments filling out the horizons to air-conditioned shopping malls and luxury cars choking roads. But the gains are narrowly concentrated. Professionals who work in technology centers in the south of the country and around the capital of New Delhi have enjoyed substantial progress. A rapidly growing domestic auto industry is a source of relatively high-paying jobs. Magnates like Gautam Adani, one of Asia’s richest men, have seen their business empires enhanced by their relationships with Mr. Modi and his willingness to eviscerate regulatory impediments to their greater fortune. But most Indian workers are effectively marooned in the so-called informal sector — laboring at roadside stalls, in small shops and in itinerant trades where they have no guarantee of income or the possibility of advancement. The failure of economic growth to yield more jobs is in large part the story of how India missed out on the manufacturing boom that played out in East Asia over recent decades. From South Korea and China to Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, hundreds of millions of people have escaped poverty via wages earned in factories. India has not shared in that transformation in large part because of a historical focus on self-sufficiency, a disdain for international trade and stultifying bureaucracy that has discouraged investment. “The whole manufacturing thing bypassed India,” Mr. Subramanian, the economist, said. “It’s that bigger development failure that is continuing to haunt India.” Mr. Modi has pursued initiatives aimed at bolstering manufacturing and increasing exports. His administration has streamlined regulations and improved ports. Yet despite some high-profile developments like Apple moving the assembly of some iPhones to India, manufacturing makes up only 13 percent of the country’s economy, according to World Bank data. That is a lower share than a decade ago, when Mr. Modi took office. Foreign money has flowed into India’s stock markets, multiplying share prices, a key element of Mr. Modi’s pro-business image. But persuading international investors to put money directly into Indian companies — a riskier bet — has been a harder sell. His Hindu nationalist party has demonized the Muslim minority, a source of social ferment that has raised fears of instability. The election could further discourage additional investment, because Mr. Modi will likely have a more difficult time gaining passage of stalled reforms sought by business, including laws making it easier to amass land and hire and fire workers. With no clear pathway toward economic dynamism and more challenging political circumstances, Mr. Modi might resort to a time-honored method of shoring up support: He will expand social welfare programs, tapping government coffers to hand out more cash to communities in need. Such a course could potentially diminish available funding for the advancement of the government’s signature program — its aggressive construction of highways, ports, airports and other infrastructure. Those plans are central to maintaining India’s strong economic growth and the broader campaign to encourage investment in manufacturing. Some fear that any short-term pursuit of political favor through the scattering of money could undermine the longer-term project of spurring jobs through the promotion of industry. “You need to ensure that the benefits of economic development reach the maximum number of people,” said Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at Global Data.TS Lombard, a forecasting and consulting firm in London. “If people keep depending on welfare and are not getting the benefits of economic development, then it basically just creates stagnation.” Geopolitical alterations appear to give India a fresh crack at growing its manufacturing base. As the United States and China engage in trade hostilities, multinational brands are seeking to reduce their heavy dependence on Chinese factories to make their goods. Major retailers like Walmart are increasingly looking to India as an alternative to China. But capturing that potential investment demands continued upgrading of highways, rail connections and ports, along with a focus on vocational training to give people the needed skills to take up factory work. Even before the election, there were doubts that Mr. Modi’s administration was moving quickly enough to realize these gains. “India is a counterweight to China in terms of geopolitics, and we will continue to see some of that investment flowing,” Ms. Deveshwar said. “But the scale at which they are provisioning the ecosystem for these opportunities just is not large enough.”",indian election

nytimes,The World Heads to the Polls,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/climate/global-elections-climate-change-policy.html,"One of the busiest election cycles in history is coming to an end on Sunday. Hundreds of millions of people have gone to the polls in South Africa, India and Mexico in recent days, and millions more will do the same in the European Union this weekend. As Somini Sengupta has explained in a series of articles this week, among the issues that the new leaders of these countries will face: how to transition away from coal, how to adapt to record-breaking heat and, in Europe’s case, how to address a growing backlash against environmental policies. Today, I want to lay out some the most pressing environmental challenges in these areas, and what the results announced in the past few days point to. Keep in mind that whatever happens in the United States election in November will affect many of these countries, too. The biggest takeaway from India’s elections, as my colleagues who cover the country put it, is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “lost his aura of invincibility.” His Bharatiya Janata Party still won far more seats than any other party, and Modi is set to take up his third consecutive term as prime minister. But his party didn’t win an outright majority and now needs coalition partners to stay in power. Many critics of the current government see the result as good news for democracy, because Modi will be forced to seek support from more moderate allies. It could also bring some relief to activists like Ritwick Dutta, an environmental lawyer whose efforts to defend nature in India have made him a target of the government. But it’s unclear how fewer seats in Parliament will affect Modi’s environmental policies. The main challenges facing the next Indian government are what to do about the effects of climate change, including heat waves that have killed dozens of people. During the elections, at least 33 poll workers were among them, and the heat also closed schools in several states,",one busiest election cycle history coming end sunday hundred million people gone poll south africa india mexico recent day million european union weekend somini sengupta explained series article week among issue new leader country face transition away coal adapt recordbreaking heat europe case address growing backlash environmental policy today want lay pressing environmental challenge area result announced past day point keep mind whatever happens united state election november affect many country biggest takeaway india election colleague cover country put prime minister narendra modi lost aura invincibility bharatiya janata party still far seat party modi set take third consecutive term prime minister party didnt win outright majority need coalition partner stay power many critic current government see result good news democracy modi forced seek support moderate ally could also bring relief activist like ritwick dutta environmental lawyer whose effort defend nature india made target government unclear fewer seat parliament affect modis environmental policy main challenge facing next indian government effect climate change including heat wave killed dozen people election least poll worker among heat also closed school several state
nytimes,Narendra Modi’s India,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/briefing/modis-india.html,"Narendra Modi has just won re-election as India’s prime minister, though by a far narrower margin than expected. With his third consecutive term, the charismatic strongman has still sealed his position as the country’s most significant leader in generations. Despite having led India for a decade, Modi has in some ways kept his country guessing about his vision. On major issues — India’s relationships, its economy, its society and its government — it’s still unclear what sort of country Modi wants India to be. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain four of the big questions. India has spent recent years deepening its relationship with the United States. It has gotten closer to American allies, including Japan and Australia, and ordered high-end American weapons systems — the kind that create dependence down the road. And it is unlikely to side with China. In 2020, Chinese troops crossed into territory controlled by India and killed 20 soldiers in a skirmish. Modi has kept Beijing at arm’s length since then. But Modi, 73, has signaled that he doesn’t want to be a U.S. ally. Some officials in his inner circle still regard the United States warily. American diplomats complain about New Delhi’s apparent efforts to erode democratic norms and the rights of minority groups. So India keeps its options open. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States tried in vain to persuade India to take a stand against the war. India still processes Russian oil (picking up the slack created by international sanctions). It still buys weapons from Russia. India spent the Cold War trying to position itself as a nonaligned power. Old habits die hard. India recently overtook China as the most populous country and the fastest-growing large economy. Still, most of the country remains poor. Some 800 million people need help filling their stomachs. Modi’s ideas about how to help them can be contradictory — they’re both globally minded and protectionist.",narendra modi reelection india prime minister though far narrower margin expected third consecutive term charismatic strongman still sealed position country significant leader generation despite led india decade modi way kept country guessing vision major issue india relationship economy society government still unclear sort country modi want india today newsletter ill explain four big question india spent recent year deepening relationship united state gotten closer american ally including japan australia ordered highend american weapon system kind create dependence road unlikely side china chinese troop crossed territory controlled india killed soldier skirmish modi kept beijing arm length since modi signaled doesnt want u ally official inner circle still regard united state warily american diplomat complain new delhi apparent effort erode democratic norm right minority group india keep option open russia invaded ukraine united state tried vain persuade india take stand war india still process russian oil picking slack created international sanction still buy weapon russia india spent cold war trying position nonaligned power old habit die hard india recently overtook china populous country fastestgrowing large economy still country remains poor million people need help filling stomach modis idea help contradictory theyre globally minded protectionist
nytimes,"In Global Elections, Strongmen Are Taken Down a Notch","June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/world/global-elections-india-turkey-democracy.html,"In India, a powerful leader wins another term but sees his party’s majority vanish. In South Africa, the governing party is humbled by voters for the first time since the end of apartheid. In Britain, a populist insurgent barges into an election that is shaping up to be a crushing defeat for the long-ruling Conservatives. If there is a common thread halfway through this global year of elections, it is a desire by voters to send a strong signal to the powers that be — if not quite a wholesale housecleaning, then a defiant shake-up of the status quo. Even in Mexico, where Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and the handpicked successor of the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was elected in a landslide last Sunday, voters were rewarding the forces that had uprooted the country’s entrenched establishment only six years earlier. With a billion-plus people going to the polls in more than 60 countries, some analysts had feared that 2024 would pose a fateful test for democracy — one that it might fail. For years, populist and strongmen leaders have chipped away at democratic institutions, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of elections, while social media has swamped voters with disinformation and conspiracy theories. In some of the biggest, most fragile democracies, leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey had been regarded as close to invincible, using appeals to nationalism or sectarianism to mobilize supporters and bending institutions to suit their purposes. Yet now, Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan have both had their wings clipped. Soaring inflation, chronic unemployment and uneven economic growth have widened inequality in India, Turkey and elsewhere, frustrating voters who have shown a willingness to buck the establishment. “We do have electoral systems that are producing outcomes the governing parties didn’t want,” said Ben Ansell, a professor of comparative democratic institutions at the University of Oxford. “They’ve all been destabilized by a tricky economic environment, and behaving like strongmen hasn’t saved them.” Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan remain in power, each now in his third term. But Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., lost dozens of seats and will have to govern in a coalition with two secular parties. Turkey’s opposition struck a blow against Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party in April, winning a string of local elections and solidifying its control of important cities like Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. “In a lot of countries where there’s been talk of backsliding, that’s where we’ve seen a bounce back,” Professor Ansell said. “For Modi and Erdogan, taking the sheen off their infallibility was very important.” With so many elections in so many countries, it is dangerous to generalize. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia rolled up 88 percent of the vote in a landslide re-election victory in March that spoke less to Russian public sentiment and more to the ability of an autocrat, facing no meaningful opposition, to stage-manage a show of support for his war in Ukraine. In Europe, far-right parties are expected to perform well in European Parliament elections, which began on Thursday. Analysts said they did not believe this would jeopardize the political center that has governed Europe in the post-World War II era. And Poland provided a source of reassurance last fall, when voters pushed out its nationalist Law and Justice Party in favor of a more liberal opposition. Still, the success of far-right figures like Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy, attests to the enduring appeal of populism. “Populists and right-wingers will continue to make gains and strike fear into the European political establishment,” the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said in its analysis of the top risks of 2024. Britain’s general election was shaken up on Monday when Nigel Farage, a populist politician, pro-Brexit campaigner and ally of former President Donald J. Trump, announced he would run for a seat in Parliament under the banner of his Reform U.K. party, which has a strident anti-immigration message. That will add to the headache for the Conservative Party, which has lagged the opposition Labour Party by double digits in polls for nearly 18 months. Reform, which is fielding candidates across the country, could siphon off Conservative votes among those who blame the party for a weak economy and rising immigration numbers since Britain left the European Union in 2020. Some critics argue that the Conservative Party’s problems stem from its free-market policies, which they say have disillusioned voters in disadvantaged parts of Britain and set it apart from right-wing parties in Europe or Mr. Trump’s Make America Great Again movement in the United States. More fundamentally, though, the Conservatives have been in power for 14 years, and they face the same pent-up dissatisfaction with the status quo that fueled the recent elections in India, South Africa and Turkey. In some countries, the urge to break with the past has led voters to make unorthodox choices: Javier Milei, a flamboyant libertarian economist, swept to power in Argentina last November with a promise to close its central bank and wage an all-out assault on what he described as a corrupt political “caste.” Some analysts argue that similarly disruptive forces are driving the presidential race in the United States, where a comparatively healthy economy and the advantages of incumbency have not spared President Biden, who faces a neck-and-neck challenge from Mr. Trump even after the former president was convicted of multiple felonies. “It’s not about left versus right, it’s about the status quo versus change,” said Frank Luntz, an American political strategist who has lived and worked in Britain. “You can’t buy a house in the U.K., the N.H.S. doesn’t work,” he said, referring to the National Health Service. “In the United States, you can’t afford housing or health care. It’s about broken promises, year after year after year.” That sense of betrayal is even more acute in countries like South Africa, where the African National Congress, or A.N.C., has governed since the start of democracy there in 1994, piling up majorities even as the economy and social infrastructure crumbled. Last week, voters finally rebelled, driving down the A.N.C.’s vote share to 40 percent, from 58 percent in the last national election in 2019. Among their biggest complaints is the lack of job opportunities: South Africa’s unemployment rate — at 42 percent, including those who have stopped looking for work — is one of the highest in the world. Stagnation has widened the country’s already profound inequality. South Africans flock to cities looking for work. But many end up in decrepit buildings and slapdash shack communities, often without running water or sanitary toilets. Regular power outages leave streets dark and residents of many communities vulnerable to crime. South Africa’s murder rate is six and a half times as high as that of the United States and 45 times as high as Germany’s. Jacob Zuma, the scandal-scarred former president, has benefited from this misery, helping start a new party, umKhonto weSizwe, or M.K., which won nearly 15 percent of the vote, mostly at the expense of his former party, the A.N.C. Mr. Zuma attracts a feverish following among disillusioned A.N.C. supporters, who accuse the party of selling out to wealthy white businesspeople and not moving aggressively enough to redistribute wealth to the Black majority after apartheid. India’s election was a comparable anti-incumbent revolt, even if Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. is still the largest party in Parliament by a wide margin. The party’s campaign spending was at least 20 times as much as that of its main opposition, the Congress Party, which had its bank accounts frozen by the government in a tax dispute on the eve of the election. The country’s news outlets have been largely bought off or bullied into silence. And yet, the results showed Mr. Modi, 73, losing his majority for the first time since he took office in 2014. Analysts said that reflected widespread dissatisfaction with how the fruits of India’s economy have been shared. While India’s steady growth has made it the envy of its neighbors — and created a conspicuous billionaire class — those riches have not flowed to the hundreds of millions of India’s poor. The government has handed out free rations of wheat, grain and cooking gas. It offers home water connections, subsidizes building supplies and gives farmers cash. But it has not tackled India’s inflation or unemployment, leaving hundreds of millions of people, especially women, chronically out of work. There is also some evidence that Mr. Modi’s appeals to Hindu nationalism were not as potent as in previous elections. The B.J.P.’s candidate did not even win the constituency that is home to the lavish Ram temple, built on grounds disputed by Hindus and Muslims. Mr. Modi inaugurated the temple just before the campaign started, hoping it would galvanize his Hindu political base. The economy figured into Mexico’s election as well, but in a very different way. While overall growth was disappointing — averaging only 1 percent a year during Mr. López Obrador’s term — the government doubled the minimum wage and strengthened the peso, lifting millions of Mexicans out of poverty. “People vote with their wallets, and it’s very obvious there’s more money in the wallets of almost everybody in Mexico,” said Diego Casteñeda Garza, a Mexican economist and historian at Uppsala University in Sweden. Still, analysts said, there was also a desire among voters to cement the change that Mr. López Obrador, a charismatic outsider, symbolized when he came to power in 2018. Even as Ms. Sheinbaum, 61, vowed to continue her mentor’s policies, she cast herself — Mexico’s first female and Jewish president — as a change agent. For Jacqueline González, 33, who works at a cargo transportation company and viewed Mexico’s previous governments as corrupt, that made voting for Ms. Sheinbaum an easy decision. “With Obrador we have already seen, although some people don’t want to admit it, some change,” Ms. González said. “Let’s hope it continues with Sheinbaum.”",india powerful leader win another term see party majority vanish

nytimes,"Rahul Gandhi, Long on the Ropes, Looks Set for an Unexpected Comeback","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-congress-rahul-gandhi.html,"Just last year, Rahul Gandhi and the once-powerful party he led, the Indian National Congress, seemed to be on the ropes and little threat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s consolidation of political power. Congress had not been a competitive factor in national elections in years, winning fewer and fewer votes each time Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party was elected. And Mr. Gandhi himself had been convicted on a slander charge and barred from holding a seat in Parliament. But on Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi and a broad opposition coalition led by his Congress party registered a far stronger showing than expected in India’s elections, setting the stage for an unlikely comeback. “He has finally arrived,” said Rasheed Kidwai, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi. “This time he has improved his vote share by at least 17 million votes, which is very substantial.” On Wednesday, Mr. Modi’s party announced that it had reached an agreement to form a governing coalition, including two parties that do not necessarily share its vision. Congress won 99 seats in the 543-seat Parliament, a gain of 47 seats, and the alliance of which it is the leading part won a total of 232. Congress and its alliance of over two dozen political groups have presented the results as a “moral victory” over a B.J.P. government that they say was trying to change the country’s Constitution and have portrayed as anathema to India’s identity as a multifaith and secular country. “The fight was to save the Constitution,” Mr. Gandhi, the son, grandson and great-grandson of Congress prime ministers, said as the results poured in. The first major sign that Congress might be able to contend came in May 2023, just a couple of months after Mr. Gandhi’s conviction for slander, when his party won the state government of Karnataka, in the south of India, from the B.J.P. The lift was temporary; Congress soon lost power in three states it governed to the B.J.P. But at the same time, political experts say, Mr. Gandhi was pushing for changes within the party, India’s oldest, which had long resisted overhauling an archaic organizational structure that kept its top leaders isolated from the grass-roots workers who deliver votes. Feelings that Congress’s leaders were corrupt and out of touch resulted in a string of defeats over a number of years and then degenerated into messy infighting within the party. For the past two years, party members say, Mr. Gandhi has tried to reverse the decline of Congress by surrounding himself with young policy analysts to help him understand the challenges facing India, as well as party veterans with their ears to the ground in towns and villages that Congress was targeting. The party has in addition improved its social media game, trumpeting its messages on platforms like WhatsApp and YouTube. Mr. Gandhi also raised his profile by embarking on two walks across India — meeting farmers in their fields and vegetable sellers on city streets; and drinking tea with recent graduates and gig workers — in an effort to show common cause with ordinary people. Perhaps most important, Congress focused on a strategy of reaching out to and cooperating with key regional players across the country whose influence had dimmed under B.J.P. rule. Congress leaders made a series of “seat-sharing” agreements with regional leaders, big and small, that strengthened the alliance against Mr. Modi’s party. To avoid splitting the anti-B.J.P. vote, Congress had its own candidates contest fewer seats. And Mr. Gandhi campaigned vigorously alongside the leaders of like-minded political groups across India. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Gandhi also won support, party leaders say, by characterizing Mr. Modi as a leader who would destroy India’s secular character. “It is a victory not just for him and our alliance partners but for the millions of poor Indians who voted to protect the secular fabric of this country,” said Srinivas B.V., another Congress leader, about Mr. Gandhi. “People showed Modi: ‘You are not God, and you can be replaced.’” Since being voted to power in 2014, Mr. Modi has sought to position Hinduism, the religion of some 80 percent of Indians, at the center of the country’s official identity. He also promised to end corruption, overhaul the economy and help India become a “developed nation” by 2047. But after his re-election in 2019, he leaned into Hindu themes to a greater extent. Mr. Gandhi’s efforts to contrast his vision for India with Mr. Modi’s largely paid off, analysts say, even if some members of his party jumped ship and sided with the B.J.P. Many of the politicians who defected from Congress to the B.J.P. lost their seats, including in West Bengal and Maharashtra, where Congress and its partners did especially well. Throughout the campaign Mr. Gandhi persistently linked Mr. Modi with Gautam Adani, Asia’s richest man, saying the prime minister was working for his tycoon friends, not for the vast majority of Indians who are poor. As if to vindicate this line of attack, over the two days after the election results were announced, the price of Mr. Adani’s flagship stock fell by 14 percent. (It then recovered somewhat on Wednesday.) “People directly correlate Adani Ji with Modi Ji — directly,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters after the results, using Hindi honorifics for the two men. Researchers who traveled across India during the voting said Mr. Gandhi had beaten Mr. Modi on his own turf in many places by focusing on issues like the millions of Indians without jobs and the economic difficulties faced by farmers. He also accused the B.J.P. of governance failures and worked with local political groups fighting for social justice and for the empowerment of lower-caste Indians. Uttar Pradesh, where Mr. Modi made dozens of visits to campaign for local candidates, is one state where the changing fortunes of the two largest political groupings was evident. The state is India’s largest, and accounts for 80 of the Parliament’s 543 seats. The B.J.P. recorded its worst performance there since 2009, in part because Mr. Gandhi was able to craft an alliance with a powerful local leader, Akhilesh Yadav. In addition to the 37 seats picked up by Mr. Yadav’s Samajwadi Party, Congress won six, helped by aggressive campaigning by Mr. Gandhi’s sister, Priyanka Vadra, who helped defeat a former soap-opera actress who had served as a minister in Mr. Modi’s government. The B.J.P. won 33 seats, down from 62 in the previous Parliament. The election results announced on Wednesday have given a major lift to hundreds of thousands of Congress workers across the country, who were growing tired of the internal infighting that has plagued their party for years. Outside Congress headquarters in New Delhi, Bansi Lal Meena, a veteran Congress member from the state of Rajasthan, was exultant about his party’s performance. “In villages and on the ground, the B.J.P. spread lies for years against us — saying that we are anti-Hindu,” he said. “They used my religion as a weapon against me to win votes.” He added: “We will show them now because our people are also in Parliament.”",last year rahul gandhi oncepowerful party led indian national congress seemed rope little threat prime minister narendra modis consolidation political power congress competitive

On the back of his singular charisma and political skill, a onetime-fringe religious ideology was pulled to the center of Indian life. Landslide election victories remade India’s politics, once dominated by diverse coalitions representing a nation that had shaped its independence on secular principles. But there were always risks in wrapping a party’s fortunes so completely in the image of one man, in inundating a country of many religions, castes and cultures with that leader’s name, face and voice. Voters could start to think that everything was about him, not them. They could even revolt. On Tuesday, Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., fell back to earth. After having promised their biggest election romp yet, they lost more than 60 seats. Mr. Modi will remain in office for a third term, but only with the help of a contentious coalition of parties, some of which are opposed to his core beliefs and want power of their own. With the result, India’s strained democracy appeared to roar back to life, its beaten-down political opposition reinvigorated. And after a decade in which Mr. Modi’s success in entrenching Hindu supremacy had often felt like the new common sense, India is seeing its leader and itself in a new light, and trying to understand this unexpected turn. Most fundamentally, the opposition, newly coalesced for what it called a do-or-die moment as Mr. Modi increasingly tilted the playing field, found a way to use the cult of personality around him to its advantage. Opposition leaders focused on bread-and-butter issues, often at granular levels in particular constituencies. They hammered Mr. Modi over persistent unemployment and stark inequality. But the B.J.P., with Mr. Modi from on high its only spokesman, was often left with just one answer: Trust in “Modi’s guarantee.” “The ‘Modi’s guarantee’ slogan turned out to be our undoing,” said Ajay Singh Gaur, a B.J.P. worker who had campaigned in the party stronghold of Uttar Pradesh, the northern state where Mr. Modi suffered his biggest blow on Tuesday, losing nearly half of the B.J.P. seats. “The opposition made that sound like this was not about him having delivered, or trying to deliver,” Mr. Gaur said, “but about him being an arrogant politician.” Mr. Modi gave his adversaries a lot to work with, even declaring that he may not be “biological” and that he had been sent by God. He has still emerged better so far than other Indian leaders who deeply centralized power. He remains in control of levers of power that could help him and his party restore their dominance. Indira Gandhi, who had also glorified herself and went so far as to suspend India’s democracy after declaring a national emergency, was voted out at the peak of her powers before returning three years later. But Mr. Modi’s B.J.P., the world’s largest political party, finds itself in a tough spot after years of centralization and reliance on a government machinery put to the service of one man, analysts say. The huge advantage the party has built in numbers and resources is undercut by a lack of internal consultation and delegation of authority. That was a key reason for its failure in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, with 240 million people, and surrounding states. Local B.J.P. leaders were disenchanted by a top-down approach toward choosing candidates, as well as what they called a misguided belief that Mr. Modi’s popularity could allow the party to sidestep potent local issues and caste factors. With Mr. Modi sucking up all the oxygen at the top, other senior leaders of the party have been left to fight for relevance and a voice. His relentless self-promotion has also alienated the leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., the B.J.P.’s right-wing fountainhead. During election seasons, the R.S.S. activates its vast grass-roots network in support of B.J.P. candidates. While Mr. Modi, a former foot soldier in the organization, has advanced many of its goals, his consolidation of power goes against its regimented nature and its focus on ideology over individual personalities. One R.S.S. insider, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking, said that Mr. Modi’s exalting of himself had created such resentment inside the group that some of its leaders welcomed any sort of reality check for him, short of his ouster. Sudheendra Kulkarni, a political analyst who served as an aide to the first B.J.P. prime minister in the 1990s, said Mr. Modi had pushed through unpopular legislation — in particular farm laws that prompted a yearlong protest that choked New Delhi — without consulting with party officials in the affected states. They were left to cope with the ramifications. “The B.J.P. was never a one-leader party,” Mr. Kulkarni said. “All that changed with Narendra Modi in 2014. He sought to promote a new authoritarian idea of one nation, one leader.” Hypothesizing that Mr. Modi’s popularity had peaked, the opposition saw an opening to go after a decisive section of votes in the Indian political formula. For decades before his rise in 2014, neither the B.J.P. nor the Indian National Congress, the country’s two largest parties, could muster majorities on its own. Mr. Modi expanded his party’s backing by consolidating right-wing Hindu voters and drawing in new supporters with his personal story of a humble caste and economic background and a promise to change lives through robust development. A decade later, in this year’s election, the opposition found traction in painting a very different picture of Mr. Modi — as an autocratic friend of billionaires. Since Mr. Modi had achieved everything he had set out to do, the opposition argued, his pursuit of a resounding majority could only mean that he would seek radical change to the Constitution. That claim stirred anxiety among India’s Dalits and other underprivileged groups, who see the Constitution as their only protection in a deeply unequal society, guaranteeing them a share of government jobs and seats in higher education as well as elected bodies. The opposition was able to push the message harder when some in Mr. Modi’s right-wing support base, long seen as having an upper-caste bias, called for revoking the quotas. Caste identity was a major driving factor for voters in many states, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, with its 80 parliamentary seats. The decline of a Dalit party in the state meant that about 20 percent of the votes were potentially up for grabs. In Ayodhya, the constituency where Mr. Modi inaugurated a grand Ram temple earlier this year in an effort to consolidate his Hindu support base, the opposition put up a Dalit candidate. He handily defeated the B.J.P.’s two-term incumbent. In other cases, voters showed their anger over the B.J.P.’s perceived sense of impunity. In Kheri, a constituency where the son of a B.J.P. minister rammed his S.U.V. into a crowd of protesting farmers, killing several, the minister also lost. Mr. Modi’s election campaign took its most divisive turn in Banswara, in the desert state of Rajasthan, where he called India’s 200 million Muslims “infiltrators” and raised fears that the opposition would give them India’s wealth, including Hindu women’s necklaces. Banswara’s B.J.P. incumbent was routed in the election. While the loss was most likely attributable to local issues, the national discussion noted that Mr. Modi’s comments had not helped. In his own constituency of Varanasi, in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Modi’s winning margin of nearly half a million votes in 2019 shrank to about 150,000 — a disappointing showing after he had dispatched some of the B.J.P.’s most senior leaders to camp out there to help him achieve an even bigger victory. Jai Prakash, a tea and samosa seller in Varanasi, said some of the prime minister’s work, particularly his improvement of roads, was popular. But Mr. Modi was losing the plot, Mr. Prakash said, by turning to issues disconnected from people’s day-to-day lives. “Prices are skyrocketing; so is unemployment,” Mr. Prakash said. “He has done some good. But people cannot worship him endlessly.”",everything became prime minister narendra modi india party centuryold hindunationalist network propelled unimagined height back singular charisma political

nytimes,"India Keeps Its Glorious, Messy Tradition Alive","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/opinion/india-election-modi-bjp-democracy.html,"Back in January, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India looked all but unstoppable, he visited the small city of Ayodhya for the unofficial start of his campaign to win a third term. The location was freighted with symbolism. For decades, Hindu nationalists had sought to build a temple in Ayodhya, at a spot they believe to be the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. The only problem was that there was already a house of worship on the spot, a mosque built by a Mughal emperor in 1528. A Hindu mob had dismantled the mosque in 1992, setting off riots that killed 2,000 people, most of them Muslims. The ruins were a flashpoint of religious tensions in India for decades. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party promised to build the temple, and the lavish event at which Modi officially opened it was a showcase for that achievement. At the time it seemed like strong election-year messaging for a politician who built his career on the twin planks of Hindu nationalism and building a muscular new India. Unlike other politicians, the event implied, Modi made promises and kept them. “It is the beginning of a new era,” he declared. Feeling supremely confident, Modi had boldly asked the Indian electorate for something akin to a blank check to remake the country — control of 400 seats in Parliament in elections that began in April and concluded on June 1. And why shouldn’t he have been confident? India’s economy was the fastest-growing in the world. India had overtaken China as the world’s most-populous country. World leaders sought Modi’s support on issues ranging from the war in Ukraine to the climate crisis, cementing India’s ascent in global affairs. But the ever unpredictable electorate of the world’s largest democracy responded to Modi’s demand for still more power resolutely: No thanks. In a stunning rebuke, election results released on Tuesday showed that India’s voters have reduced the parliamentary share of Modi’s party by more than 60 seats, not enough for an outright majority, never mind the supermajority he had sought. It struck me as particularly apt that despite all the fanfare about the glorious new temple in Ayodhya, Modi’s party lost the city’s parliamentary seat to a political opposition that had been all but left for dead. There appears to be a clear ceiling to the appeals to Hindu identity on its own. “We are very happy with the temple, but people were fed up with the B.J.P.,” a local business leader, Rakesh Yadav, told Reuters. “People will not always fall for the caste or temple-mosque politics. They also want to see development.” This is a big year for democracy, almost a referendum of sorts on the very idea. Dozens of countries are holding elections, representing roughly half of the world’s population. But authoritarianism has been on the march. The latest report from Freedom House found that by many measures, global freedom has declined for the 18th straight year. India, despite its status as the world’s most-populous democracy, has been a poster child for this decline under Modi: His government has taken aim at just about every form of freedom. He has attacked and grievously weakened the independence of India’s once boisterous press. He has jailed critics and political opponents. He has sharpened religious animosity, referring during this campaign to Muslims, who make up 14 percent of India’s population, as “infiltrators” who seek to steal wealth and power from the Hindu majority. It’s an Indian edition of the nationalist, populist playbook playing out around the world. That a newly unified opposition managed to prevent Modi’s party from winning an outright majority under these conditions took everyone, including me, by surprise. And it suggests that even when would-be authoritarians attempt to tilt the playing field, voters can and will state their will, no matter the autocrat’s preferences. “The B.J.P. had positioned itself as a new hegemonic power,” Yamini Aiyar, a scholar and analyst of Indian democracy who has been a frequent target of Hindu nationalist rage, told me. “The beauty of an election is that politicians have to go to the people, and the people get an opportunity to express their anxieties and their perspectives.” Express them they did. Looking back, the weakness of the B.J.P.’s re-election case is clear: Yes, India’s economy was growing fast. But despite the flashy new infrastructure projects and deals to increase high-tech manufacturing, the growth was not creating nearly enough jobs, and inflation remained stubbornly high, especially for food, which hits the poorest hardest. Much of the wealth generated by growth has gone to India’s richest tycoons, and inequality has soared. “The reality is that the real economy has been hurting for a very long time, and they have systematically sought to ignore it,” Aiyar said. India has managed to lift millions of people out of poverty since Modi came to power 10 years ago, but particularly in rural areas, where most Indians live, that has meant social welfare rather than jobs. There were other issues too — Modi’s allies had floated the idea of changing India’s Constitution in various ways, including removing its commitment to secularism and enshrining Hinduism as the national faith. These kinds of appeals have helped the B.J.P. in the past but seem to have had less power this time around. One clear sign was its heavy losses in Uttar Pradesh, which is not just India’s most populous state; it is also part of the heavily Hindu heartland of northern India. It also seems that the opposition may finally have gotten its act together. India’s main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, has been in decline for years and had struggled to make common cause with other opposition parties in previous elections. But this year the opposition parties managed to make a much stronger coalition. They focused on kitchen table issues and highlighted the Modi government’s ties to big business and high-flying billionaires. The opposition didn’t shy away from making the stakes for Indian democracy clear. But the relentless focus on what voters said mattered most offers lessons for those battling revanchist movements elsewhere, including in the United States. Sometimes you need to meet voters where they are. This vote wasn’t a total rebuke of Modi and his policies. He is all but certain to get his third term as prime minister by making a coalition with allied parties. But it is a clear and salutary check on his authoritarian project. This election is also a rebuke of Indian elites — in business and media especially — who had willingly surrendered to a kind of inevitability of Modi’s long-term consolidation of power, making peace with it or even celebrating it. Activists, analysts and journalists who had the temerity to speak plainly about Modi’s revanchist project and the threat he posed to the world’s biggest democracy and its long history of tolerance, secularism and free speech have been hounded out of public life. I hope that this troubling slide ends now. As the results rolled in on Tuesday, I remembered my own reporting trip to Ayodhya in 2009, when I was a correspondent for The Times based in India. An explosive new government report had just been issued about the destruction of the mosque and the role of Hindu nationalist groups in stirring up violence. But when I got there, I was surprised to find that on the hotly contested spot itself there was hardly any hoopla. The crowds of Hindu nationalist volunteers who for years had routinely shown up to build the temple with their bare hands had disappeared. India was going through a period of hopeful prosperity. Voters had just returned the Indian National Congress party and its allies to power with a larger majority, and a brilliant, teetotaling economist named Manmohan Singh was prime minister. With the future looking so alluring, no one seemed all that interested in litigating the past. These hopes were ultimately dashed amid scandals over political corruption and mismanagement. The Congress party, which once seemed unstoppable, lost power in 2014 for failing to deliver on its promise to bring India to its long-awaited place among the world’s richest and most powerful nations. The years ahead will, with any luck, be ones of negotiation and compromise. This will be a return to form for India, a vastly diverse nation whose unruly polity has resisted autocracy at every turn since it shrugged off British colonial rule in 1947. The whole world should breathe a sigh of relief that India’s voters have spoken, loudly, in favor of continuing that glorious, messy tradition.",back january prime minister narendra modi india looked

nytimes,The New Kingmakers Who Could Make or Break Modi’s Government,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-elections-modi-coalition.html,"After his first two national election victories, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India easily set his own terms, with his Bharatiya Janata Party winning clear majorities. The result was different in this vote. It was still a victory, but one that left him dependent on a host of coalition partners — particularly on politicians from two regional parties who could make or break Mr. Modi’s ability to form a government. Of the more than a dozen parties that make up the B.J.P.’s coalition, known as the National Democratic Alliance, most won just one or two seats, leaving the party in a difficult predicament. On Wednesday, the B.J.P. said it had reached an agreement to form a coalition government that includes those two regional parties — the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United. They will be the biggest junior partners, but they are also avowedly secular and removed from Mr. Modi’s Hindu-nationalist ideology. Cameras on Wednesday followed every word, meeting and movement of the leaders of the two parties, N. Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party, and Nitish Kumar of Janata Dal-United. Their combined 28 seats in Parliament will give the prime minister the votes he needs to stay in power and push through his agenda. Here is what to know about the men who unexpectedly found themselves as kingmakers, and about the parties they lead. Though some of the members of the B.J.P.’s coalition this year share Mr. Modi’s hard-line vision, both the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United are moderate, secular parties that have a diverse support base. Speculation in India was focusing on what terms the men were demanding for their support, which are unlikely to be rooted in ideology. Both Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar are known to be pragmatic, deal-making politicians whose priorities will be practical concessions for their state, or perhaps cabinet positions. Mr. Kumar has earned a reputation in India for his willingness to switch allegiances over the past decade. He has gone between aligning himself with the B.J.P.-led coalition to supporting its rivals no fewer than five times. Most recently, in January, he returned to Mr. Modi’s alliance just 18 months after he’d left it and with just months to go until the election. He has said his switching of political loyalties was in the interest of his state, Bihar. Mr. Naidu has also at times broken with Mr. Modi, cutting ties with the B.J.P. in 2018 and joining forces with its chief rival, Indian National Congress, ahead of the 2019 elections. He has said that his party has aligned with the B.J.P. out of “political compulsion.” Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar have both been in politics for decades, and have been mentioned as potential candidates for prime minister. Mr. Naidu of the T.D.P., based in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, is a technocrat who has aggressively pushed for investment from information technology companies in his region. His policies helped bring high-paying jobs for I.T. professionals and transformed the city of Hyderabad. Mr. Kumar is a nine-time chief minister of Bihar, India’s poorest state, who comes from a homegrown socialist background. He has pushed for more funds for low-caste Hindus, and his alliance with the B.J.P. broadened support for the party in his state.",first two national election victory prime minister narendra modi india easily set term bharatiya janata party winning clear majority result different vote still victory one left dependent host coalition partner particularly politician two regional party could make break mr modis ability form government dozen party make bjps coalition known national democratic alliance one two seat leaving party difficult predicament wednesday bjp said reached agreement form coalition government includes two regional party telugu desam party janata dalunited biggest junior partner also avowedly secular removed mr modis hindunationalist ideology camera wednesday followed every word meeting movement leader two party n chandrababu naidu telugu desam party nitish kumar janata dalunited combined seat parliament give prime minister vote need stay power push agenda know men unexpectedly found kingmaker party lead though member bjps coalition year share mr modis hardline vision telugu desam party janata dalunited moderate secular party diverse support base speculation india focusing term men demanding support unlikely rooted ideology mr naidu mr kumar known pragmatic dealmaking politician whose priority practical concession state perhaps cabinet position mr kumar earned reputation india willingness switch allegiance past decade gone aligning bjpled coalition supporting rival fewer five time recently january returned mr modis alliance month hed left month go election said switching political loyalty interest state bihar mr naidu also time broken mr modi cutting tie bjp joining force chief rival indian national congress ahead election said party aligned bjp political compulsion mr naidu mr kumar politics decade mentioned potential candidate prime minister mr naidu tdp based southern state andhra pradesh technocrat aggressively pushed investment information technology company region policy helped bring highpaying job professional transformed city hyderabad mr kumar ninetime chief minister bihar india poorest state come homegrown socialist background pushed fund lowcaste hindu alliance bjp broadened support party state
nytimes,"Modi se reelige en India, pero pierde mayoría parlamentaria: 4 claves de las elecciones","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/06/05/espanol/elecciones-india-modi.html,"[Estamos en WhatsApp. Empieza a seguirnos ahora] La primera década de Narendra Modi como primer ministro de India ha estado plagada de sorpresas. Ninguna, sin embargo, se comparó con lo que ocurrió el martes por la mañana, cuando Modi ganó su segunda reelección, pero su partido perdió la mayoría en el Parlamento. Con esa derrota, el aire de invencibilidad de Modi también pareció desvanecerse por primera vez desde que asumió el cargo en 2014. Los resultados de las elecciones fueron particularmente interesantes porque, tras casi siete semanas de votaciones en todo el país, las encuestas a pie de urna publicadas pocos días antes del recuento final mostraban que el Partido Popular Indio de Modi ganaría de forma aplastante, como ya había hecho en dos ocasiones anteriores. Sin embargo, el Partido Popular Indio solo obtuvo 239 escaños, muy por debajo de los 272 necesarios para formar gobierno. La alianza de la oposición, liderada por el Partido del Congreso Nacional Indio, obtuvo 235 escaños. Con los 52 escaños obtenidos por los aliados del Partido Popular Indio, Modi seguirá a la cabeza. Pero su atractivo ha disminuido y su liderazgo ha cambiado radicalmente. Cuando Modi llegó al poder en 2014, prometió progreso económico, el fin de la corrupción y la promoción del hinduismo como elemento central de la identidad india. Con todo ello, se presentó como un líder singularmente fuerte, capaz de reunir a sus seguidores para trabajar por la nación. Esto contrastaba con el gobierno anterior. Antes de que Modi fuera elegido por primera vez, India llevaba 25 años gobernada por coaliciones. Los primeros ministros del Partido del Congreso, del Partido Popular Indio y de terceros partidos más pequeños se alternaban para dirigir India por comités. Modi rompió con esa tradición y lideró un nuevo sistema de partido único dominado por el Partido Popular Indio. Como líder, Modi mostró poco interés en compartir el poder. Cuando invalidó la mayor parte del papel moneda de India en 2016, ni siquiera su ministro de Finanzas conocía la decisión de antemano. Cuando decidió imponer la ley marcial en Jammu y Cachemira, el único estado de mayoría musulmana de India, presentó el plan al Parlamento como un hecho, sin pedir su aprobación. Pero esos días han terminado. Los dos mayores partidos que han surgido como nuevos socios de coalición del Partido Popular Indio están liderados por N. Chandrababu Naidu y Nitish Kumar, legisladores veteranos a quienes se conoce como tecnócratas moderados. Es probable que ambos exijan más autoridad en el Parlamento. De hecho, ambos han sido señalados como posibles candidatos a primer ministro, si se produjera otra coalición que no estuviera liderada ni por el Partido Popular Indio ni por el Congreso Nacional Indio. Cuando el martes se dieron a conocer los primeros mapas electorales nacionales que mostraban el número de escaños ganados y perdidos en el Parlamento, se observó una nueva y sorprendente configuración. Los mapas mostraban que el partido de Modi había perdido zonas de territorio en los estados del norte de habla hindi, considerados bastiones del Partido Popular Indio. Al mismo tiempo, el su partido avanzó en regiones que se habían resistido a Modi en el pasado. Perdió decenas de escaños en el estado septentrional de Uttar Pradesh, pero ganó muchos en el estado oriental de Odisha y en el estado meridional de Telangana. La única parte del país que ahora parece unificada por un partido es el “cinturón tribal”, que atraviesa los estados centrales. Sus comunidades relativamente pobres han sido hábilmente puestas en la mira de la política hinduista y los beneficios sociales del Partido Popular Indio. Los inversores de los mercados bursátiles indios de Mumbai respondieron con entusiasmo a las primeras encuestas a pie de urna. El lunes, se lanzaron a la compra, haciendo subir los precios de las llamadas acciones de Modi, aquellas asociadas a las prioridades de gasto del primer ministro o que se cree que se benefician de sus políticas fiscales. Cuando se conocieron los resultados de las urnas, esas acciones se desplomaron. Las acciones del buque insignia del Grupo Adani perdieron cerca del 19 por ciento de su valor en un solo día de cotización. El índice bursátil perdió cerca del 6 por ciento, casi anulando las ganancias de los cinco primeros meses del año. Modi sigue siendo popular entre los magnates de India, pero los inversores deben averiguar qué empresas se beneficiarán del nuevo gobierno. Chris Wood, responsable mundial de estrategia de renta variable del banco de inversión Jefferies, advirtió el año pasado que si Modi perdía, “cabría esperar una corrección del 25 por ciento, si no más”, en el mercado bursátil indio. Históricamente, a las empresas indias les ha ido igual de bien durante los periodos de gobierno de coalición. Por lo tanto, Wood dijo que, incluso sin Modi en el poder, espera que las acciones “se recuperen bruscamente” sobre la base de la fortaleza de la economía del país en su conjunto. Esta nueva era en el Parlamento empezará seguramente con algunas rondas de retribuciones políticas. Los políticos que no hayan conseguido escaños para sus jefes serán despedidos. Es probable que los partidos más pequeños exijan puestos en el gabinete, lo que significará sustituir a miembros del Partido Popular Indio. Habrá que revisar las políticas. ¿Se inclinará India por la exportación de manufacturas, con el objetivo de sustituir a China como la fábrica del mundo? ¿Protegerá ahora a las industrias locales que temen la competencia extranjera? Milan Vaishnav, investigador de la Fundación Carnegie para la Paz Internacional, advirtió que India no puede volver exactamente a la política de coalición que precedió a Modi. Es probable que sus nuevos socios exijan un estilo autoritario similar al que Modi ejerce desde Nueva Delhi. El tipo de líderes estatales que necesita ahora como socios de coalición “son tan absolutistas como el gobierno nacional”, dijo Vaishnav. Podrían, por ejemplo, pedir a la policía federal que detuviera a sus oponentes, como ha hecho Modi. Las elecciones de India fueron las mayores celebradas en la historia de la democracia, con más de 600 millones de votantes en seis fases. Esta vez no hubo quejas sobre las máquinas de votación electrónica, ni temores de que India se hubiera convertido en una dictadura bajo el mandato de Modi. En un discurso difícil pronunciado el martes por la noche desde la sede del Partido Popular Indio, Modi calificó las elecciones de “celebración de la democracia”.",estamos en whatsapp empieza

nytimes,Modi Struggles to Stay on Top: 4 Takeaways From India’s Election,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-election-2024-takeaways.html,"Narendra Modi’s first decade as India’s prime minister came with its fair share of surprises. None, however, looked anything like what happened on Tuesday morning when he won his second re-election, but lost his party’s majority in Parliament. With that loss, Mr. Modi’s air of invincibility also appeared to be fading for the first time since he took office in 2014. The election results were especially shocking because, after nearly seven sweaty weeks of voting across the country, exit polls released just days before the final tally showed that Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party would win in a landslide, as it had twice before. Instead, the Bharatiya Janata Party won only 240 seats, well short of the 272 needed to form a government. The opposition alliance, led by the Indian National Congress Party, took 235 seats. With the 52 seats won by B.J.P. allies, Mr. Modi will remain on top. But his allure has been diminished, and his leadership has fundamentally changed. When Mr. Modi came to power in 2014, he promised economic progress, an end to corruption and to promote Hinduism as being central to India’s identity. Through it all, he presented himself as a uniquely strong leader, capable of marshaling his followers to work for the nation. This was in contrast to the previous government. Before Mr. Modi was first elected, India spent 25 years being governed by coalitions. Prime ministers from the Congress Party, the B.J.P. and smaller third parties took turns running India by committee. Mr. Modi broke with that tradition, leading a new single-party system dominated by the B.J.P. As leader, Mr. Modi showed little interest in sharing power. When he invalidated most of India’s paper currency in 2016, not even his finance minister knew about the decision in advance. When he decided to impose de facto martial law on Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state, he presented the plan to Parliament as a done deal, without seeking approval. But those days are over. The two biggest parties that have emerged as the B.J.P.’s new coalition partners are led by N. Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar, veteran lawmakers who are known as technocratic moderates. Both are likely to demand greater authority in Parliament. In fact, both have been eyed as possible candidates for prime minister, if there were to be another coalition led by neither the B.J.P. nor the Congress. When the first nationwide electoral maps showing the number of seats gained and lost in Parliament were revealed on Tuesday, they showed a striking new pattern. The maps showed that Mr. Modi’s party lost swaths of territory across states in the Hindi-speaking north that were considered B.J.P. strongholds. At the same time, the B.J.P. made inroads in regions that had resisted Mr. Modi in the past. He lost dozens of seats in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, but he gained plenty in the eastern state of Odisha and the southern state of Telangana. The only part of the country that now looks unified by one party is the “tribal belt,” which weaves across the central states. Its relatively poor communities have been skillfully targeted by the B.J.P.’s Hindu-first politics and welfare benefits. Investors in India’s stock markets in Mumbai responded eagerly to the early exit polls. On Monday, they went on a buying spree, driving up the prices of so-called Modi stocks, those associated with the prime minister’s spending priorities or thought to benefit from his fiscal policies. When the actual vote results were counted, those stocks came crashing down. Shares in the Adani Group’s flagship stock lost about 19 percent of their value in one day of trading. The blue-chip index lost about 6 percent, nearly wiping out its gains from the first five months of the year. Mr. Modi remains popular with India’s business tycoons, but investors need to find out which companies will stand to benefit from a new government. Chris Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, an investment bank, warned last year that if Mr. Modi were to lose he “would expect a 25 percent correction, if not more” in the Indian stock market. Historically, Indian companies have done just as well during periods of coalition government. So, Mr. Wood said, even without Mr. Modi in power, he expects stocks to “bounce back sharply” based on the strength of the country’s economy as a whole. This new era in Parliament is sure to begin with a few rounds of political retribution. Politicians who failed to deliver seats for their bosses will be shown the door. Smaller parties are likely to demand cabinet positions, which will mean replacing members of the B.J.P. Policies will need to be revised. Will India lean into export manufacturing, aiming to replace China as the world’s factory? Will it move to protect local industries that fear foreign competition? Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, cautioned that India cannot exactly return to the coalition politics that preceded Mr. Modi. His new partners are likely to make demands that match the authoritarian style Mr. Modi exercises from New Delhi. The kind of state leaders he now needs as coalition partners “are just as absolutist as the national government,” Mr. Vaishnav said. They could, for instance, call for federal police agencies to arrest opponents, as Mr. Modi has done. India’s election was the biggest conducted in the history of democracy, with more than 600 million voters casting ballots in six phases. This time, there were no complaints about the electronic voting machines, or fears that India had become a dictatorship under Mr. Modi. In a difficult speech delivered on Tuesday night from the B.J.P. headquarters, Mr. Modi called the election a “celebration of democracy.”",narendra modis first decade india prime minister came fair share surprise none however looked anything like happened tuesday morning second reelection lost party majority parliament loss mr modis air invincibility also appeared fading first time since took office election result especially shocking nearly seven sweaty week voting across country exit poll released day final tally showed mr modis bharatiya janata party would win landslide twice instead bharatiya janata party seat well short needed form government opposition alliance led indian national congress party took seat seat bjp ally mr modi remain top allure diminished leadership fundamentally changed mr modi came power promised economic progress end corruption promote hinduism central india identity presented uniquely strong leader capable marshaling follower work nation contrast previous government mr modi first elected india spent year governed coalition prime minister congress party bjp smaller third party took turn running india committee mr modi broke tradition leading new singleparty system dominated bjp leader mr modi showed little interest sharing power invalidated india paper currency even finance minister knew decision advance decided impose de facto martial law jammu kashmir india muslimmajority state presented plan parliament done deal without seeking approval day two biggest party emerged bjps new coalition partner led n chandrababu naidu nitish kumar veteran lawmaker known technocratic moderate likely demand greater authority parliament fact eyed possible candidate prime minister another coalition led neither bjp congress first nationwide electoral map showing number seat gained lost parliament revealed tuesday showed striking new pattern map showed mr modis party lost swath territory across state hindispeaking north considered bjp stronghold time bjp made inroad region resisted mr modi past lost dozen seat northern state uttar pradesh gained plenty eastern state odisha southern state telangana part country look unified one party tribal belt weave across central state relatively poor community skillfully targeted bjps hindufirst politics welfare benefit investor india stock market mumbai responded eagerly early exit poll monday went buying spree driving price socalled modi stock associated prime minister spending priority thought benefit fiscal policy actual vote result counted stock came crashing share adani group flagship stock lost percent value one day trading bluechip index lost percent nearly wiping gain first five month year mr modi remains popular india business tycoon investor need find company stand benefit new government chris wood global head equity strategy jefferies investment bank warned last year mr modi lose would expect percent correction indian stock market historically indian company done well period coalition government mr wood said even without mr modi power expects stock bounce back sharply based strength country economy whole new era parliament sure begin round political retribution politician failed deliver seat boss shown door smaller party likely demand cabinet position mean replacing member bjp policy need revised india lean export manufacturing aiming replace china world factory move protect local industry fear foreign competition milan vaishnav senior fellow carnegie endowment international peace cautioned india exactly return coalition politics preceded mr modi new partner likely make demand match authoritarian style mr modi exercise new delhi kind state leader need coalition partner absolutist national government mr vaishnav said could instance call federal police agency arrest opponent mr modi done india election biggest conducted history democracy million voter casting ballot six phase time complaint electronic voting machine fear india become dictatorship mr modi difficult speech delivered tuesday night bjp headquarters mr modi called election celebration democracy
nytimes,"Needing Help to Stay in Power, Modi Loses His Aura of Invincibility","June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/modi-india-election.html,"Suddenly, the aura of invincibility around Narendra Modi has been shattered. In an Indian election in which his party’s slogan had promised a landslide victory and Mr. Modi even repeatedly referred to himself as sent by God, the results announced on Tuesday were unexpectedly sobering. Mr. Modi, 73, is set to take up a third consecutive term as prime minister, after the Election Commission gave final confirmation early Wednesday that the parties that make up his coalition had collectively passed the majority mark in Parliament. It is a feat that only one other Indian leader has accomplished, and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., won far more seats than any other party. But instead of a runaway win, the B.J.P. lost dozens of seats. It now finds itself at the mercy of its coalition partners — including one politician notorious for how often he has switched sides — to stay in power, a sharp reversal a decade into Mr. Modi’s transformational tenure. As the results came into view, the country’s stock markets plunged. Opposition parties, newly unified in what they had called an effort to save the country’s democracy, rejoiced. And India, while extending Mr. Modi’s firm hold on power, learned that there are limits to his political potency, even as he made the election, usually fought seat by seat, squarely about himself. Mr. Modi took a more positive view in a statement on X declaring that his coalition had won a third term. “This is a historical feat in India’s history,” he said. For Mr. Modi, a generous reading of the outcome could be that only with his personal push could his party overcome its unpopularity at the local level and scrape by. Or it could be that his carefully cultivated brand has now peaked, and that he can no longer outrun the anti-incumbency sentiment that eventually catches up with almost any politician. How Mr. Modi will react is uncertain — whether he will harden his effort to turn away any challenge to his power, or be chastened by the voters’ verdict and his need to work with coalition partners that do not share his Hindu-nationalist ideology. “Modi is not known as a consensual figure. However, he is very pragmatic,” said Arati Jerath, a political analyst based in New Delhi. “He will have to moderate his hard-line Hindu-nationalist approach to issues. Perhaps we can hope for more moderation from him.” Few doubt, however, that Mr. Modi will try to deepen his already considerable imprint on the country over the next five years. On his watch, India, the world’s most populous nation, has enjoyed newfound prominence on the global stage, overhauled its infrastructure for the needs of its 1.4 billion people, and been imbued with a new sense of ambition as it tries to shed the legacy of its long colonial past. At the same time, Mr. Modi has worked to turn a vastly diverse country held together by a secular democratic system into an overtly Hindu-first state, marginalizing the country’s large Muslim minority. His increasingly authoritarian turn — with a crackdown on dissent that has created a chilling environment of self-censorship — has pushed India’s vociferous democracy closer to a one-party state, his critics say. And the country’s economic growth, while rapid, has mostly enriched those at the top. Mr. Modi rose from a humble background as the son of a tea seller, becoming India’s most powerful and popular leader in decades by building a cult of personality, spending big on infrastructure and welfare, and tilting India’s democratic institutions in his favor. The ultimate goal was to cement his standing as one of the most consequential prime ministers in India’s nearly 75 years as a republic and make the B.J.P. the country’s only plausible national governing force. But the results on Tuesday pointed to a sharp turnaround for India’s beleaguered main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, which had been seen by many as irrevocably weakened after big losses in the previous two elections. The once-dominant Congress, long positioned at India’s political center, struggled for years to find a direction and offer an ideological alternative to the B.J.P. But it and its coalition partners found traction in this election by attacking Mr. Modi’s government over issues like unemployment, social justice and the prime minister’s ties to India’s billionaires. Last year, as Rahul Gandhi, the public face of the Congress party, sought to burnish his standing by leading long marches across India, the B.J.P. ensnared him in a court case that led to his expulsion from Parliament. He was later returned to his seat by India’s highest court, and was set to win re-election on Tuesday. Speaking as early returns came in, Mr. Gandhi, 53, said the fight was not just against the B.J.P. It was also, he said, against all the government institutions that had stood with Mr. Modi in trying to hamstring the opposition through arrests and other punitive actions. “This was about saving the Constitution,” he said, lifting a small copy that he had been carrying with him and displaying during speeches on the campaign trail. Exit polls released on Saturday, after more than six weeks of voting in the world’s largest democratic exercise, indicated that Mr. Modi’s party was headed toward an easy victory. But there had been signs during the campaign that Mr. Modi was worried about the outcome. He crisscrossed the country for more than 200 rallies over about two months and gave dozens of interviews, hoping to use his charismatic appeal to paper over any weaknesses in his party. In speeches, he often veered from his party’s message of a rising India to counter accusations that he privileged business and caste elites. He also abandoned his once-subtle dog whistles targeting India’s 200 million Muslims, instead demonizing them directly, by name. As things stood by nightfall, Mr. Modi would need at least 33 seats from allies to cross the 272 minimum for forming a government. Two regional parties in particular would be kingmakers: the Telugu Desam Party, in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, with 16 seats, and the Janata Dal (United) party in the eastern state of Bihar, with 12. Both parties are avowedly secular, raising hopes among Mr. Modi’s opponents that their influence could slow down his race to turn India’s democracy into a Hindu-first state. Some of Mr. Modi’s biggest losses came in India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh in the north, with about 240 million people. His party leads the state government and had won 62 of the state’s 80 seats in the national Parliament’s lower house in the previous election, in 2019. As counting entered its last stretch in the evening on Tuesday, the B.J.P. was leading in only 33 seats there. In his own constituency, Varanasi, Mr. Modi’s victory margin was reduced from half a million last time to about 150,000. The loss in Faizabad constituency, in particular, told the story of how some of the prime minister’s biggest offerings had struggled to connect with voters. The constituency is home to the lavish Ram temple in Ayodhya, built on grounds disputed between Hindus and Muslims. Its construction was a cornerstone of the nearly century-old Hindu-nationalist movement that had swept Mr. Modi to power. He hoped that its grand inauguration just before the election campaign began would both unite his Hindu support base and bring new supporters into the fold. Some B.J.P. workers said that the party’s flaunting of the temple may have made a large section of Hindus at the bottom of the rigid caste hierarchy uncomfortable. The opposition had painted Mr. Modi as pursuing an upper-caste agenda that denied underprivileged Hindus opportunities to reverse centuries of oppression. “Because of overemphasis on the Ram temple issue, the opposition got united,” said Subhash Punia, 62, a farmer from the state of Rajasthan who supports Mr. Modi and was waiting outside the B.J.P. headquarters in Delhi on Tuesday. To offset potential losses in his Hindi-speaking northern stronghold, Mr. Modi had set a lofty goal for this election: to gain a foothold in the country’s more prosperous south. He broke some new ground in Kerala, a state dominated by the political left and long hostile to his ideology. But overall in the south, he struggled to improve on the 29 seats, out of 129, that his party had won in the previous election. Perhaps the biggest disappointment for the B.J.P. in southern India was that it once again appeared not to have won any of the 40 seats in Tamil Nadu, a state with its own strong cultural and linguistic identity. Mr. Modi had campaigned aggressively there, even visiting one coastal town for two days of meditation as the voting neared its conclusion. “Mr. Modi’s and the B.J.P.’s antics cannot win my Tamil heart,” said S. Ganesan, a waiter at a hotel in Kanniyakumari, the town Mr. Modi visited.",suddenly aura invincibility around narendra modi shattered indian election party slogan promised landslide victory mr modi

nytimes,Modi Will Feel the Heat in a Third Term. And Not Just Politically.,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/climate/modi-climate-india-election.html,"India, the world’s most populous country, is also among the most vulnerable to climate hazards. That’s not only because of the heat and floods that global warming has exacerbated, but also because so many of the country’s 1.4 billion people are vulnerable to begin with. Most people are poor, by global standards, and they have no safety net. Narendra Modi, the Hindu nationalist prime minister who claimed victory Tuesday for a third five-year term, will face major challenges fueled by climate change. The six-week process of voting took place amid a scorching heat wave in several parts of the country. In the northern states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, at least 33 people, including poll workers, died of complications from the heat last week, according to government authorities cited by Reuters. Rohit Magotra, deputy director of Integrated Research and Action for Development, called on national election officials to reschedule elections in the future to avoid such calamities. He pointed out that workers from every political party suffer in the heat, and so do voters, who often have to line up under the sun. “I definitely see the momentum building up, and elections are unlikely to be scheduled in peak summer in future,” said Mr. Magotra, whose organization has advocated heat solutions in Indian cities. The Election Commission this year did set up a task force to monitor weather conditions, but only after voting got underway amid abnormally high temperatures. It also sent election workers a list of heat precautions prepared by the National Disaster Management Agency. However, according to a report published in Scroll, an Indian news site, political-party campaigners were not told to do anything differently because of the heat. While parliamentary elections are traditionally scheduled in summer in India, climate change is making summers increasingly dangerous. This year, one weather station in Delhi broke the all-time temperature record with a reading above 52 degrees Celsius (127 degrees Fahrenheit) in late May. It was the third consecutive year of abnormally high temperatures in India, all made worse by climate change, according to scientific studies of the heat waves. Several cities and states have heat action plans, at least on paper. But as one independent analysis concluded last year, they are mostly underfunded and lack concrete ways to identify and protect the most vulnerable. Mr. Modi’s government has faced some of the most potent opposition in recent years from farmers’ organizations. And many of their concerns are rooted in climate issues. Their agitation reflects a deep malaise in agriculture, a major slice of the Indian economy. More than half of all Indians depend on farming to make a living. Groundwater is in short supply in many important agricultural regions. Farmers are in deep debt in many parts of the country. On top of that, extreme weather and unpredictable rains have wrecked harvests repeatedly in recent years. In 2020, hundreds of thousands of farmers, mostly from India’s breadbasket region of Punjab and Haryana, erected encampments outside of New Delhi and rolled their tractors into the capital in protests that turned violent. Their initial grievance was over Mr. Modi’s efforts to open up more private investment in agriculture, which the farmers said would make them vulnerable to low prices driven by corporate profit motives. In the face of the uprising, the government backed down, a rarity for Mr. Modi, but also a move that signals the seriousness with which his administration took the protests. Again this year, farmers marched on the capital, this time demanding higher government-set prices for wheat and rice. The global image of India is often associated with its fast-growing economy, its vibrant cities and its huge, young work force. But a majority of its people still depend on farm incomes, most of its 770 million poor people live in the countryside, and the government has been unable to create anywhere near the number of jobs outside agriculture that its booming youth population demands. Fixing agriculture in the era of climate change is likely to be among Mr. Modi’s most profound challenges in the coming years. “Definitely, increasing extreme weather events (floods, heat waves, storms) are the most important climate challenge facing the government,” said M. Rajeevan, a former secretary in the Earth Sciences Ministry who is now vice chancellor at Atria University in Bengaluru. Climate change is driven principally by the burning of fossil fuels, the dirtiest of which is coal. At international summits, Mr. Modi has emphasized his push to build renewable energy infrastructure. At the same time though, his government has continued to expand coal. That’s driven by both political and economic considerations. Coal is the incumbent fuel. Public and private companies, many of them politically connected, are invested in coal. The government’s main interest is in keeping electricity prices low. Coal remains the country’s biggest source of electricity. Coal use grew this year, partly driven by climate change itself. Higher temperatures drive up demand for air-conditioners and fans, which drives up demand for electricity. India’s power-sector emissions soared in the first quarter of 2024, according to Ember, a research organization that tracks emissions.

nytimes,India’s Stock Market Tumbles on Close-Run Election Result,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-stock-market-election.html,"Traders in Mumbai started the day with a shock as India began tallying votes from a seven-week election and it became clear that the government of Narendra Modi was not doing nearly as well as expected. By the end of trading on Tuesday, the markets were down 6 percent, nearly wiping out the year’s gains. India’s stock market had been on a tear, buoyed by economic growth and confidence that Mr. Modi, the most powerful prime minister in generations, was sure to secure a third term in office. Investors looking to India yearn for political stability and many have done especially well during the first 10 years of Mr. Modi’s pro-business leadership. Even after Tuesday’s decline, the blue-chip Nifty 50 index has nearly tripled since Mr. Modi became prime minister. But the Indian market’s main indexes have entered choppier waters on the way to the election. Some companies, namely those considered “Modi stocks,” fared especially poorly as the election result came into view. The Adani Group’s fortunes were always the most eye-catching. Gautam Adani rapidly became Asia’s richest man, as his infrastructure-oriented businesses worked in harmony with Mr. Modi’s plans for the country. That is, until a short-seller’s report in early 2023 accused the Adani Group of market manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani’s stocks crashed, but within a year, as it became clear that the Indian government and many of the world’s biggest banks would be patient with the companies, they climbed back up. On Tuesday, Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship company, shed 19 percent of its value, putting it halfway between its peak and subsequent trough. Mr. Modi has anyway won enough seats to form a new government, albeit with a much slimmer majority than forecast. Chris Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, an investment bank, last year gamed out an even worse result for Mr. Modi, saying during an investor summit in October that if Mr. Modi were suddenly defeated, “I would expect a 25 percent correction if not more.” Some degree of correction might be welcomed, at least among professional investors. A lot of the market’s recent growth has reflected the influx of small-time local investors buying stocks for the first time. With global investors clamoring for access to India’s long-term prospects, it had become nearly impossible to find bargains. Christine Phillpotts, portfolio manager for emerging markets at Ariel Investments in Chicago, said India had become “the market that everybody loves to love.” That meant there weren’t many opportunities left, even though she agreed that India’s economy would keep growing robustly. The other consolation is that, as much as investors need to know which government policies will favor which companies, India’s track record suggests that its economy is capable of growing rapidly under conditions of vigorous, multiparty democracy. Some of the fastest rates it ever clocked were achieved under a previous coalition government, during a growth spurt from 2006 to 2010. Even Mr. Wood, who anticipated a market decline in response to Mr. Modi’s losing ground, thought that stocks “would bounce back sharply, due to the momentum” of India’s economy as a whole.",trader mumbai started day shock india began tallying vote sevenweek election became clear government narendra modi nearly well expected end trading tuesday market percent nearly wiping year gain india stock market tear buoyed economic growth confidence mr modi powerful prime minister generation sure secure third term office investor looking india yearn political stability many done especially well first year mr modis probusiness leadership even tuesday decline bluechip nifty index nearly tripled since mr modi became prime minister indian market main index entered choppier water way election company namely considered modi stock fared especially poorly election result came view adani group fortune always eyecatching gautam adani rapidly became asia richest man infrastructureoriented business worked harmony mr modis plan country shortsellers report early accused adani group market manipulation accounting fraud adanis stock crashed within year became clear indian government many world biggest bank would patient company climbed back tuesday adani enterprise group flagship company shed percent value putting halfway peak subsequent trough mr modi anyway enough seat form new government albeit much slimmer majority forecast chris wood global head equity strategy jefferies investment bank last year gamed even worse result mr modi saying investor summit october mr modi suddenly defeated would expect percent correction degree correction might welcomed least among professional investor lot market recent growth reflected influx smalltime local investor buying stock first time global investor clamoring access india longterm prospect become nearly impossible find bargain christine phillpotts portfolio manager emerging market ariel investment chicago said india become market everybody love love meant werent many opportunity left even though agreed india economy would keep growing robustly consolation much investor need know government policy favor company india track record suggests economy capable growing rapidly condition vigorous multiparty democracy fastest rate ever clocked achieved previous coalition government growth spurt even mr wood anticipated market decline response mr modis losing ground thought stock would bounce back sharply due momentum india economy whole
nytimes,Early Election Results Suggest Sharp Turnaround for Indian National Congress,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/indian-national-congress-rahul-gandhi-election.html,"In India’s last general election, in 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party won 303 of 543 parliamentary seats — nearly six times as many as the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress. It was a stinging electoral blow for the Congress, a once-dominant party that has appeared greatly diminished in recent years, and exit polls in this year’s election had not suggested it would fare much better. But early election results on Tuesday indicated a far stronger showing than expected for the Congress. The party and its allies were leading in nearly 230 races, a sharp turnaround that prompted jubilation at the Congress headquarters in New Delhi, where supporters erupted in cheers each time a television channel announced a new lead for one of its candidates. “Whatever the final results, one thing is clear — it is a moral victory for Congress and our leader Rahul Gandhi, and defeat for B.J.P.,” said Robin Michael, a political worker, referring to Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. While there was no indication that Congress and the opposition coalition it leads would scrape together a majority to unseat Mr. Modi, party workers said that they had dented Mr. Modi’s aura of invincibility. They praised Mr. Gandhi, the Congress party’s most prominent figure and a great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first post-independence prime minister. Last year, as Mr. Gandhi sought to burnish his standing by leading long marches across India, the B.J.P. ensnared him in a court case that led to his expulsion from Parliament. He was later returned to his seat by India’s highest court. On Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi was on track to win his parliamentary seat in the southern state of Kerala. The Congress, long positioned at India’s political center, has struggled to find a direction and offer an ideological alternative to the Hindu nationalist B.J.P. It has faced rebellions, infighting and periodic fits of soul-searching over whether to rally behind a new face — only to stick with its dynastic leadership. This year, despite expectations, Mr. Gandhi had set a target of doubling the party’s 2019 tally of 52 seats. By late Tuesday afternoon, it was leading in nearly 100 seats. “We will stop Modi from making a mockery of this country and turning people against each other,” said Sandeep Mishra, a Congress worker at party headquarters. He added: “Indians are fed up with Modi.”",india last general election prime minister narendra modis party parliamentary seat nearly six time many main opposition party indian national congress stinging electoral blow congress oncedominant party appeared greatly diminished recent year exit poll year election suggested would fare much better early election result tuesday indicated far stronger showing expected congress party ally leading nearly race sharp turnaround prompted jubilation congress headquarters new delhi supporter erupted cheer time television channel announced new lead one candidate whatever final result one thing clear moral victory congress leader rahul gandhi defeat bjp said robin michael political worker referring mr modis bharatiya janata party indication congress opposition coalition lead would scrape together majority unseat mr modi party worker said dented mr modis aura invincibility praised mr gandhi congress party prominent figure greatgrandson jawaharlal nehru india first postindependence prime minister last year mr gandhi sought burnish standing leading long march across india bjp ensnared court case led expulsion parliament later returned seat india highest court tuesday mr gandhi track win parliamentary seat southern state kerala congress long positioned india political center struggled find direction offer ideological alternative hindu nationalist bjp faced rebellion infighting periodic fit soulsearching whether rally behind new face stick dynastic leadership year despite expectation mr gandhi set target doubling party tally seat late tuesday afternoon leading nearly seat stop modi making mockery country turning people said sandeep mishra congress worker party headquarters added indian fed modi

nytimes,Modi’s Party May Need Partners to Form a Government,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/modi-bjp-india-government-coalition.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party will likely need help from junior partners to form a government under the rules of India’s parliamentary system, early election results indicated on Tuesday. In a 2019 election that handed Mr. Modi a second consecutive term, his Bharatiya Janata Party won 303 of the 543 seats in Parliament. That was well over the 272 seats it needed to rule on its own. This time, exit polls released over the weekend suggested that the B.J.P. would once again easily win more than 272 seats. But as of early Tuesday afternoon, official voting results indicated that it would win about 240 seats instead. Winning that much support — 44 percent of the seats in Parliament’s lower house — is an impressive feat in India or any other country. And the new math should not prevent Mr. Modi from securing a third consecutive term as prime minister. But the dip in the B.J.P.’s electoral support, far short of Mr. Modi’s goal and his last electoral performance, will likely have political ramifications. At a minimum, the B.J.P. will have to depend more on the junior members of its existing multiparty alliance. Two of the most prominent parties do not share Mr. Modi’s Hindu-first agenda. And if the governing alliance does not win a majority, the B.J.P. will be able to form a government only by adding new partners. It may not come to that. As of Tuesday afternoon the alliance was on track to scrape by with a narrow parliamentary majority — far short of its target of 400 seats, but enough to stay in power with its existing members.",prime minister narendra modis ruling party likely need help junior partner form government rule india parliamentary system early election result indicated tuesday election handed mr modi second consecutive term bharatiya janata party seat parliament well seat needed rule time exit poll released weekend suggested bjp would easily win seat early tuesday afternoon official voting result indicated would win seat instead winning much support percent seat parliament lower house impressive feat india country new math prevent mr modi securing third consecutive term prime minister dip bjps electoral support far short mr modis goal last electoral performance likely political ramification minimum bjp depend junior member existing multiparty alliance two prominent party share mr modis hindufirst agenda governing alliance win majority bjp able form government adding new partner may come tuesday afternoon alliance track scrape narrow parliamentary majority far short target seat enough stay power existing member
nytimes,How Modi Capitalized on India’s Economic Rise,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-election-economy.html,"Ten years after Narendra Modi was first elected prime minister, India’s economy is roughly twice as large. That is what happens when a country grows at 7 percent a year, as India has been doing, on average, since it opened its markets to international competition in 1991. That steady growth has been skillfully repackaged to promote an image of one man’s leadership making it all happen. Along with nationalism and Hindu pride, the idea that Mr. Modi can make the economy move has been central to his appeal since the beginning. And Mr. Modi has burnished India’s economy in ways that count the most with voters: He made visible infrastructure expansions and distributed welfare benefits to the majority of Indians, who remain poor by global standards even as the country’s higher-income groups learn to flex their spending power. Most of the rest of the world — especially the United States and other Western countries that hope to persuade India to join them in constraining China’s and Russia’s strategic ambitions — wants India’s economy to accelerate. Part of that story could be a shift in manufacturing, like the one Apple has underway in South India. And the world’s investment professionals are eager for India’s successes under Mr. Modi to start paying dividends that they can’t find elsewhere. But even the most eager investors can’t overlook some of the problems that confront India as it becomes the world’s newest heavyweight. While Mr. Modi basked in the glow of a successful moon landing and the country’s innovative “digital public infrastructure,” the political opposition tried to speak past him to the frustrated masses who clamor for more and better jobs. The opposition also tried rousing public anger over Mr. Modi’s ties with the country’s biggest tycoons. That seems not to have worked, neither in politics nor in the markets, in the case of Gautam Adani. Last year the billionaire’s empire was accused, with much flash and fury, of stock manipulation. But the claims hardly broke through, and Adani stocks went back to soaring.",ten year narendra modi first elected prime minister india economy roughly twice large happens country grows percent year india average since opened market international competition steady growth skillfully repackaged promote image one man leadership making happen along nationalism hindu pride idea mr modi make economy move central appeal since beginning mr modi burnished india economy way count voter made visible infrastructure expansion distributed welfare benefit majority indian remain poor global standard even country higherincome group learn flex spending power rest world especially united state western country hope persuade india join constraining china russia strategic ambition want india economy accelerate part story could shift manufacturing like one apple underway south india world investment professional eager india success mr modi start paying dividend cant find elsewhere even eager investor cant overlook problem confront india becomes world newest heavyweight mr modi basked glow successful moon landing country innovative digital public infrastructure political opposition tried speak past frustrated mass clamor better job opposition also tried rousing public anger mr modis tie country biggest tycoon seems worked neither politics market case gautam adani last year billionaire empire accused much flash fury stock manipulation claim hardly broke adani stock went back soaring
nytimes,The Heat Wave Scenario That Keeps Climate Scientists Up at Night,"June 3, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/opinion/heat-technology-climate.html,"On a recent Thursday evening, a freakish windstorm called a derecho (Spanish for “straight ahead”) hit Houston, a city of more than two million people that also happens to be the epicenter of the fossil fuel industry in America. In a matter of minutes, winds of up to 100 miles per hour blew out office building windows, uprooted trees and toppled electric poles and transmission towers. Nearly a million households lost power. Which meant that not only was there no light; there was no air-conditioning. The damage from the storm was so extensive that, five days later, more than 100,000 homes and businesses were still marooned in the heat and darkness. Luckily, the day the derecho blew in, the temperature in Houston, a city infamous for its swampy summers, was in the low to mid-80s. Hot, to be sure, but for most healthy people, not life-threatening. Of the at least eight deaths reported as a result of the storm, none were from heat exposure. But if this storm had arrived several days later, perhaps over the Memorial Day weekend, when the temperature in Houston hit 96 degrees, with a heat index as high as 115, it might have been a very different story. “The Hurricane Katrina of extreme heat” is how Mikhail Chester, director of the Metis Center for Infrastructure and Sustainable Engineering at Arizona State University, once put it to me, echoing the memory of the catastrophic 2005 hurricane that struck Louisiana, devastated New Orleans and killed more than 1,300 people. Most people who died in Louisiana during Katrina died from drownings, injuries or heart conditions. But Dr. Chester was using Katrina as a metaphor for what can happen to a city unprepared for an extreme climate catastrophe. In New Orleans, the levee system was overwhelmed by torrential rains; eventually, 80 percent of the city was underwater. What if, instead, the electricity goes out for several days during a blistering summer heat wave in a city that depends on air-conditioning? In Dr. Chester’s scenario, a compounding crisis of extreme heat and a power failure in a major city like Houston could lead to cascading failures, exposing vulnerabilities in the region’s infrastructure that are difficult to foresee and could result in thousands, or even tens of thousands, of deaths from heat exposure in a matter of days. The risk to people in cities would be higher because all the concrete and asphalt amplifies the heat, pushing temperatures in the midafternoon as much as 15 degrees to 20 degrees higher than in surrounding vegetated areas. The derecho that hit Houston was a warning of just how quickly risks are multiplying in our rapidly warming world. As if to prove this point, some 10 days after the Houston blackout, another windstorm knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses in and around Dallas. One of the most dangerous illusions of the climate crisis is that the technology of modern life makes us invincible. Humans are smart. We have tools. Yeah, it will cost money. But we can adapt to whatever comes our way. As for the coral reefs that bleach in the hot oceans and the howler monkeys that fell dead out of trees during a recent heat wave in Mexico, well, that’s sad, but life goes on. This is, of course, an extremely privileged point of view. For one thing, more than 750 million people on the planet don’t have access to electricity, much less air-conditioning. (In India, New Delhi experienced temperatures as high as 120 degrees last week, leading to an increase in heatstroke, fears of blackouts and the possibility of water rationing.) But it is also a naïve point of view, if only because our bubble of invincibility is far more fragile than we know. So what can we expect in a heat Katrina? Last year, researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology, Arizona State University and the University of Michigan published a study looking at the consequences of a major blackout during an extreme heat wave in three cities: Phoenix, Detroit and Atlanta. In the study, the cause of the blackout was unspecified. “It doesn’t really matter if the blackout is the result of a cyberattack or a hurricane,” Brian Stone, the director of the Urban Climate Lab at Georgia Tech and the lead author on the study, told me. “For the purposes of our research, the effect is the same.” Whatever the cause, the study noted that the number of major blackouts in the United States more than doubled from 2015-16 to 2020-21. Dr. Stone and his colleagues focused on those three American cities because they have different demographics, climates and dependence on air-conditioning. In Detroit, 53 percent of buildings have central air-conditioning; in Atlanta, 94 percent; in Phoenix, 99 percent. The researchers modeled the health consequences for residents in a two-day, citywide blackout during a heat wave, with electricity gradually restored over the next three days. The results were shocking: In Phoenix, about 800,000 people — roughly half the population — would need emergency medical treatment for heatstroke and other illnesses. The flood of people seeking care would overwhelm the city’s hospitals. More than 13,000 people would die. Under the same scenario in Atlanta, researchers found there would be 12,540 visits to emergency rooms. Six people would die. In Detroit, which has a higher percentage of older residents and a higher poverty rate than those other cities, 221 people would die. Perhaps we should not be surprised by these numbers. Researchers estimate that in Europe there were 61,672 heat-related deaths in the summer of 2022, the hottest season on record on the continent at the time. In June 2021, a heat wave led to in nearly 900 excess deaths in the Pacific Northwest. And in 2010, an estimated 56,000 Russians died during a record summer heat wave. The hotter it gets, the more difficult it is for our bodies to cope, raising the risk of heatstroke and other heat illnesses. And it is getting hotter across the planet. Last year was the warmest year on record, and the 10 hottest years have all occurred in the last decade. In the study simulating a heat wave in those three cities, researchers found that the much larger death toll in Phoenix was explained by two factors. First, the temperatures modeled during a heat wave in Phoenix (90 to 113 degrees) were much higher than the temperatures in Atlanta (77 to 97 degrees) or Detroit (72 to 95 degrees), which have historically had milder heat waves. And second, the greater availability of air-conditioning in Phoenix means the risks from a power failure during a heat wave are much higher. A lot can be done to reduce these risks. Building cities with less concrete and asphalt and more parks and trees and access to rivers and lakes would help. So would a more sophisticated nationally standardized heat wave warning system. Major cities also need to identify the most vulnerable residents and develop targeted emergency response plans and long-term heat management plans. Making the grid itself more resilient is equally important. Better digital firewalls at grid operation centers thwart hacker intrusions. Burying transmission lines protects them from storms. Batteries to store electricity for emergencies are increasingly inexpensive. But the hotter it gets, the more vulnerable the grid becomes, even as demand for electricity spikes because customers are running their air-conditioning full throttle. Transmission lines sag, transformers explode, power plants fail. One 2016 study found the potential for cascading grid failures across Arizona to increase thirtyfold in response to a 1.8 degree rise in summer temperatures. “Most of the problems with the grid on hot days come from breakdowns at power plants or on the grid caused by the heat itself, or from the difficulty of meeting high demand for cooling,” Doug Lewin, a grid expert and author of the Texas Energy and Power newsletter, told me. The best way to fix that, Mr. Lewin argued, is to encourage people to reduce power demand in their homes with high efficiency heat pumps, better insulation and smart thermostats, and to generate their own power with solar panels and battery storage. The looming threat of a heat Katrina is a reminder of how technological progress creates new risks even as it solves old ones. On a brutally hot day during a recent trip to Jaipur, India, I visited an 18th-century building that had an indoor fountain, thick walls and a ventilation system to channel the wind through each room. There was no air-conditioning, but the building was as cool and comfortable as a new office tower in Houston. Air-conditioning may indeed be a modern necessity that many of us who live in hot parts of the world can’t survive without. But it is also a technology of forgetting. Once upon a time, people understood the dangers of extreme heat and designed ways to live with it. And now, as temperatures rise as a result of our hellbent consumption of fossil fuels, tens of thousands of lives may depend on remembering how that was done. Or finding better ways to do it.",recent thursday evening freakish windstorm called derecho spanish straight ahead hit houston city two million people also happens epicenter fossil fuel industry

nytimes,"As Voting Ends in India, Modi Awaits a Verdict on His 10 Years in Power","June 1, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/world/asia/india-election-modi.html,"Voting in India’s general election, a six-week-long referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decade in power, came to a close on Saturday as much of the country’s populous north was gripped by a deadly heat wave. Results will be tallied and announced on Tuesday. Mr. Modi, his power deeply entrenched, is seen as likely to win a third consecutive term as prime minister, which would make him only the second leader in India’s nearly 75 years as a republic to achieve that feat. Exit polls released after the last round of voting suggested a comfortable return for his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. A newly united opposition has put up a fight, rallying against Mr. Modi’s divisive politics and management of India’s deeply unequal economic growth. But the exit polls indicated it was struggling to significantly cut into the sizable majority in the 543-seat Parliament held by Mr. Modi’s party. In a message of thanks after the voting closed, Mr. Modi expressed confidence that “the people of India have voted in record numbers to re-elect” his government. But Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the largest opposition party, the Indian National Congress, played down the exit polls as “government surveys” and said the official results will show that his alliance was ahead. The election, held in phases over a month and a half, is the largest democratic exercise in the world, with more than 950 million eligible voters. The last stretch of the campaigning drew large rallies even as northern India baked under an intense heat wave, with temperatures frequently exceeding 110 degrees Fahrenheit, or more than 43 degrees Celsius. At least 19 poll workers have died from heat strokes or other health complications resulting from the heat in recent days. Elections in a parliamentary system like India’s are usually fought seat by seat, with a candidate’s fate determined by local economic and social factors. But the B.J.P. made its parliamentary campaign into a presidential-style referendum, putting the focus almost entirely on Mr. Modi and his leadership. The party hoped that Mr. Modi’s deep popularity would help it overcome a growing anti-incumbent sentiment 10 years into the B.J.P.’s rule. Mr. Modi held about 200 rallies across the country over more than two months of campaigning, hoping to lift up struggling candidates in his party. He also went on a media blitz, giving about 80 interviews to television stations and newspapers, almost all of them friendly to him. As the campaigning ended and a mandatory two-day election pause was set to begin, Mr. Modi retreated south to the memorial of one of India’s most celebrated monks for two days of meditation. The country’s media followed. The stream of videos and photos put out by his office, shot from multiple angles in a place where photography is usually not allowed, led the nightly news and television debates. Mr. Modi’s opponents cried foul, saying that the exercise amounted to prohibited campaigning — and that it exemplified the uneven playing field he has created. “The weather is good. The prime minister is sitting in meditation there and he has mellowed the sun goddess,” Ravi Kishan, an actor and B.J.P. candidate, told local media outlets. “This is historic — amidst intense heat, the wind started blowing today.” The opposition, hamstrung by arrests and other punitive actions as part of a crackdown, still mustered its most united front in years. Opposition leaders painted Mr. Modi as a friend to billionaires who has struggled to create jobs for the country’s large youth population. They called his party elitist, accusing it of not lifting up those in the middle and lower ends of India’s caste system. The opposition has stoked fears that if the B.J.P. remained in power, it might change the country’s Constitution to do away with affirmative action for middle and lower castes, a system put in place many decades ago to address centuries of oppression in India’s rigidly hierarchical society. Mr. Modi has vehemently rejected the charges as unfounded; the party under him has increased its outreach to lower castes. To try to keep his Hindu support base united, he turned to anti-Muslim rhetoric, leveling attacks that were unusually direct for him in recent years. The opposition has also tried to win over voters by promising a long list of welfare offerings, including the waiving of farmers’ loans, cash transfers for women and paid apprenticeships for the young. Mr. Modi, on the other hand, has stuck to an image of fiscal prudence, only highlighting his existing offerings. That, his party members say, was because he was confident of winning a third term, and he did not want to over-promise. But even though the opposition seemed to gain some traction, it faces an uphill task in unseating Mr. Modi’s government. He has built a huge electoral advantage with a robust and well-funded political machinery. In the last election, Mr. Modi’s party won 303 seats, nearly six times as many as its closest national competitor, the Indian National Congress party.",voting india general election sixweeklong referendum prime minister narendra modis decade power came close saturday much country populous north gripped deadly heat wave result tallied announced tuesday mr modi power deeply entrenched seen likely win third consecutive term prime minister would make second leader india nearly year republic achieve feat exit poll released last round voting suggested comfortable return hindunationalist bharatiya janata party bjp newly united opposition put fight rallying mr modis divisive politics management india deeply unequal economic growth exit poll indicated struggling significantly cut sizable majority seat parliament held mr modis party message thanks voting closed mr modi expressed confidence people india voted record number reelect government mallikarjun kharge president largest opposition party indian national congress played exit poll government survey said official result show alliance ahead election held phase month half largest democratic exercise world million eligible voter last stretch campaigning drew large rally even northern india baked intense heat wave temperature frequently exceeding degree fahrenheit degree celsius least poll worker died heat stroke health complication resulting heat recent day election parliamentary system like india usually fought seat seat candidate fate determined local economic social factor bjp made parliamentary campaign presidentialstyle referendum putting focus almost entirely mr modi leadership party hoped mr modis deep popularity would help overcome growing antiincumbent sentiment year bjps rule mr modi held rally across country two month campaigning hoping lift struggling candidate party also went medium blitz giving interview television station newspaper almost friendly campaigning ended mandatory twoday election pause set begin mr modi retreated south memorial one india celebrated monk two day meditation country medium followed stream video photo put office shot multiple angle place photography usually allowed led nightly news television debate mr modis opponent cried foul saying exercise amounted prohibited campaigning exemplified uneven playing field created weather good prime minister sitting meditation mellowed sun goddess ravi kishan actor bjp candidate told local medium outlet historic amidst intense heat wind started blowing today opposition hamstrung arrest punitive action part crackdown still mustered united front year opposition leader painted mr modi friend billionaire struggled create job country large youth population called party elitist accusing lifting middle lower end india caste system opposition stoked fear bjp remained power might change country constitution away affirmative action middle lower caste system put place many decade ago address century oppression india rigidly hierarchical society mr modi vehemently rejected charge unfounded party increased outreach lower caste try keep hindu support base united turned antimuslim rhetoric leveling attack unusually direct recent year opposition also tried win voter promising long list welfare offering including waiving farmer loan cash transfer woman paid apprenticeship young mr modi hand stuck image fiscal prudence highlighting existing offering party member say confident winning third term want overpromise even though opposition seemed gain traction face uphill task unseating mr modis government built huge electoral advantage robust wellfunded political machinery last election mr modis party seat nearly six time many closest national competitor indian national congress party
nytimes,A Small Army Combating a Flood of Deepfakes in India’s Election,"June 1, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/world/asia/india-election-deepfakes.html,"Through the middle of a high-stakes election being held during a mind-melting heat wave, a blizzard of confusing deepfakes blows across India. The variety seems endless: A.I.-powered mimicry, ventriloquy and deceptive editing effects. Some of it is crude, some jokey, some so obviously fake that it could never be expected to be seen as real. The overall effect is confounding, adding to a social media landscape already inundated with misinformation. The volume of online detritus is far too great for any election commission to track, let alone debunk. A diverse bunch of vigilante fact-checking outfits have sprung up to fill the breach. While the wheels of law grind slowly and unevenly, the job of tracking down deepfakes has been taken up by hundreds of government workers and private fact-checking groups based in India. “We have to be ready,” said Surya Sen, a forestry officer in the state of Karnataka who has been reassigned during the election to manage a team of 70 people hunting down deceptive A.I.-generated content. “Social media is a battleground this year.” When Mr. Sen’s team finds content they believe is illegal, they tell social media platforms to take it down, publicize the deception or even ask for criminal charges to filed. Celebrities have become familiar fodder for politically pointed tricks, including Ranveer Singh, a star in Hindi cinema. During a videotaped interview with an Indian news agency at the Ganges River in Varanasi, Mr. Singh praised the powerful prime minister, Narendra Modi, for celebrating “our rich cultural heritage.” But that is not what viewers heard when an altered version of the video, with a voice that sounded like Mr. Singh’s and a nearly perfect lip sync, made the rounds on social media. “We call these lip-sync deepfakes,” said Pamposh Raina, who leads the Deepfakes Analysis Unit, a collective of Indian media houses that opened a tip line on WhatsApp where people can send suspicious videos and audio to be scrutinized. She said the video of Mr. Singh was a typical example of authentic footage edited with an A.I.-cloned voice. The actor filed a complaint with the Mumbai police’s Cyber Crime Unit. In this election, no party has a monopoly on deceptive content. Another manipulated clip opened with authentic footage showing Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Modi’s most prominent opponent, partaking in the mundane ritual of swearing himself in as a candidate. Then it was layered with an A.I.-generated audio track. Mr. Gandhi did not actually resign from his party. This clip contains a personal dig, too, making Mr. Gandhi seem to say that he could “no longer pretend to be Hindu.” Mr. Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, which exit polls on Saturday showed had a comfortable lead, presents itself as a defender of the Hindu faith, and its opponents as traitors or impostors. Sometimes, political deepfakes veer into the supernatural. Dead politicians have a way of coming back to life via uncanny, A.I.-generated likenesses that endorse the real-life campaigns of their descendants. In a video that appeared a few days before voting began in April, a resurrected H. Vasanthakumar, who died of Covid-19 in 2020, spoke indirectly about his own death and blessed his son Vijay, who is running for his father’s former parliamentary seat in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. This apparition followed an example set by two other deceased titans of Tamil politics, Muthuvel Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa Jayaram. Mr. Modi’s government has been framing laws that are supposed to protect Indians from deepfakes and other kinds of misleading content. An “IT Rules” act of 2021 makes online platforms, unlike in the United States, responsible for all kinds of objectionable content, including impersonations intended to cause insult. The Internet Freedom Foundation, an Indian digital rights group, which has argued that these powers are far too broad, is tracking 17 legal challenges to the law. But the prime minister himself seems receptive to some kinds of A.I.-generated content. A pair of videos produced with A.I. tools show two of India’s biggest politicians, Mr. Modi and Mamata Banerjee, one of his staunchest opponents, emulating a viral YouTube video of the American rapper Lil Yachty doing “the HARDEST walk out EVER.” Mr. Modi shared the video on X, saying such creativity was “a delight.” Election officers like Mr. Sen in Karnataka called it political satire: “A Modi rock star is fine and not a violation. People know this is fake.” The police in West Bengal, where Ms. Banerjee is the chief minister, sent notices to some people for posting “offensive, malicious and inciting” content. On the hunt for deepfakes, Mr. Sen said his team in Karnataka, which works for a state government controlled by the opposition, vigilantly scrolls through social media platforms like Instagram and X, searching for keywords and repeatedly refreshing the accounts of popular influencers. The Deepfakes Analysis Unit has 12 fact-checking partners in the media, including a couple that are close to Mr. Modi’s national government. Ms. Raina said her unit works with external forensics labs, too, including one at the University of California, Berkeley. They use A.I.-detection software such as TrueMedia, which scans media files and determines whether they should be trusted. Some tech-savvy engineers are refining A.I.-forensic software to identify which portion of a video was manipulated, all the way down to individual pixels. Pratik Sinha, a founder of Alt News, the most venerable of India’s independent fact-checking sites, said that the possibilities of deepfakes had not yet been fully harnessed. Someday, he said, videos could show politicians not only saying things they did not say but also doing things they did not do. Dr. Hany Farid has been teaching digital forensics at Berkeley for 25 years and collaborates with the Deepfakes Analysis Unit on some cases. He said that while “we’re catching the bad deepfakes,” if more sophisticated fakes entered the arena, they might go undetected. In India as elsewhere, the arms race is on, between deepfakers and fact-checkers — fighting from all sides. Dr. Farid described this as “the first year I would say we have really started to see the impact of A.I. in interesting and more nefarious ways.”",middle highstakes election held mindmelting heat wave blizzard confusing deepfakes blow across india variety seems endless aipowered mimicry ventriloquy deceptive editing effect crude jokey obviously fake could never expected seen real overall effect confounding adding social medium landscape already inundated misinformation volume online detritus far great election commission track let alone debunk diverse bunch vigilante factchecking outfit sprung fill breach wheel law grind slowly unevenly job tracking deepfakes taken hundred government worker private factchecking group based india ready said surya sen forestry officer state karnataka reassigned election manage team people hunting deceptive aigenerated content social medium battleground year mr sen team find content believe illegal tell social medium platform take publicize deception even ask criminal charge filed celebrity become familiar fodder politically pointed trick including ranveer singh star hindi cinema videotaped interview indian news agency ganges river varanasi mr singh praised powerful prime minister narendra modi celebrating rich cultural heritage viewer heard altered version video voice sounded like mr singhs nearly perfect lip sync made round social medium call lipsync deepfakes said pamposh raina lead deepfakes analysis unit collective indian medium house opened tip line whatsapp people send suspicious video audio scrutinized said video mr singh typical example authentic footage edited aicloned voice actor filed complaint mumbai police cyber crime unit election party monopoly deceptive content another manipulated clip opened authentic footage showing rahul gandhi mr modis prominent opponent partaking mundane ritual swearing candidate layered aigenerated audio track mr gandhi actually resign party clip contains personal dig making mr gandhi seem say could longer pretend hindu mr modis governing bharatiya janata party exit poll saturday showed comfortable lead present defender hindu faith opponent traitor impostor sometimes political deepfakes veer supernatural dead politician way coming back life via uncanny aigenerated likeness endorse reallife campaign descendant video appeared day voting began april resurrected h vasanthakumar died covid spoke indirectly death blessed son vijay running father former parliamentary seat southern state tamil nadu apparition followed example set two deceased titan tamil politics muthuvel karunanidhi jayalalithaa jayaram mr modis government framing law supposed protect indian deepfakes kind misleading content rule act make online platform unlike united state responsible kind objectionable content including impersonation intended cause insult internet freedom foundation indian digital right group argued power far broad tracking legal challenge law prime minister seems receptive kind aigenerated content pair video produced ai tool show two india biggest politician mr modi mamata banerjee one staunchest opponent emulating viral youtube video american rapper lil yachty hardest walk ever mr modi shared video x saying creativity delight election officer like mr sen karnataka called political satire modi rock star fine violation people know fake police west bengal m banerjee chief minister sent notice people posting offensive malicious inciting content hunt deepfakes mr sen said team karnataka work state government controlled opposition vigilantly scroll social medium platform like instagram x searching keywords repeatedly refreshing account popular influencers deepfakes analysis unit factchecking partner medium including couple close mr modis national government m raina said unit work external forensics lab including one university california berkeley use aidetection software truemedia scan medium file determines whether trusted techsavvy engineer refining aiforensic software identify portion video manipulated way individual pixel pratik sinha founder alt news venerable india independent factchecking site said possibility deepfakes yet fully harnessed someday said video could show politician saying thing say also thing dr hany farid teaching digital forensics berkeley year collaborates deepfakes analysis unit case said catching bad deepfakes sophisticated fake entered arena might go undetected india elsewhere arm race deepfakers factcheckers fighting side dr farid described first year would say really started see impact ai interesting nefarious way

She was 75. Her death, in a hospital, was caused by cancer, her assistant, Usha Rabha, said in an interview. (They were not related.) So-called witch hunting has been a scourge throughout India, preying on mostly village women who are often single, widowed or otherwise isolated and involved in property or marital disputes. Accused of being witches, they have been tortured and in many cases murdered; from 2010 to 2021, more than 1,500 were killed in India, according to the country’s National Crime Records Bureau. Ms. Rabha, a slight, bespectacled woman who was born poor in an Assam village, faced down mobs for her work, badgered the police and pushed for legal protection for women. Her efforts were rewarded when legislation outlawing witch hunting was passed in Assam State in 2015. Cases there have dropped sharply, to a few per year from the several a month that were being reported when she began her campaign in the early 2000s, said Usha Rabha, who worked at Mission Birubala, the nongovernmental organization that Birubala Rabha founded. The victims of witch hunts face gruesome punishments, according to “Contemporary Practices of Witch Hunting,” a 2015 report by the Indian legal nonprofit Partners for Law in Development. They can be subjected to “forcible stripping,” the report said, “being paraded naked in public, cutting or tonsuring of the hair, blackening of the face, cutting off of the nose, pulling of the teeth to ‘defang’, gouging out the eye, whipping, gang rape, forcible consumption of human excreta, cow dung” or “killing by hanging, hacking, lynching or burying alive.” Ms. Rabha traveled from village to village in Assam to speak out against the practice and declared that there was no such thing as “daini,” or witches. She had long been suspicious of folk superstitions and of medicine men who chanted incantations over young women to drive out what they believed were evil spirits. As a young mother, Ms. Rabha was told by a local medicine man that her mentally ill son would soon die; he didn’t. That false prediction, in the 1980s, was the seed for her advocacy work, which she began in earnest around 2000.",birubala rabha indian social activist fought practice branding woman witch country remote northeast died may guwahati capital assam state region death hospital caused cancer assistant usha rabha said interview related socalled witch hunting scourge throughout india preying mostly village woman often single widowed otherwise isolated involved property marital dispute accused witch tortured many case murdered killed india according country national crime record bureau m rabha slight bespectacled woman born poor assam village faced mob work badgered police pushed legal protection woman effort rewarded legislation outlawing witch hunting passed assam state case dropped sharply per year several month reported began campaign early said usha rabha worked mission birubala nongovernmental organization birubala rabha founded victim witch hunt face gruesome punishment according contemporary practice witch hunting report indian legal nonprofit partner law development subjected forcible stripping report said paraded naked public cutting tonsuring hair blackening face cutting nose pulling teeth defang gouging eye whipping gang rape forcible consumption human excreta cow dung killing hanging hacking lynching burying alive m rabha traveled village village assam speak practice declared thing daini witch long suspicious folk superstition medicine men chanted incantation young woman drive believed evil spirit young mother m rabha told local medicine man mentally ill son would soon die didnt false prediction seed advocacy work began earnest around
nytimes,"Overlooked No More: Hansa Mehta, Who Fought for Women’s Equality in India and Beyond","May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/obituaries/hansa-mehta-overlooked.html,"This article is part of Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times. Human rights has long been considered a Western concept, but recent scholarship has been uncovering the influence of women from the global south. Women like Hansa Mehta. Mehta stood up against the British government during India’s struggle for independence. She campaigned for women’s social and political equality and their right to an education. And she fought for her ideals during the framing of the constitution for a newly independent India. For Mehta, women’s rights were human rights. This conviction was best exemplified at a 1947 meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, to which she had been appointed as one of just two women delegates, alongside Eleanor Roosevelt. Mehta boldly objected to the wording of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the commission was tasked with framing. It read: “All men are born free and equal in dignity and rights, they are endowed by nature with reason and conscience, and should act towards one another like brothers.” Mehta pointed out that the phrase “all men” was out of date and could be interpreted to exclude women. Roosevelt countered that the use of the word “men” was “generally accepted to include all human beings,” according to minutes of the meeting. But Mehta — a soft-spoken, slight woman who dressed in traditional saris — held her ground, insisting that the language should be changed to “human beings.” The declaration was adopted with her suggestion the next year, and it has been used as the foundation for treaties around the world. Two years earlier, Mehta was one of three women who drafted the Indian Women’s Charter of Rights and Duties, which affirmed that women have equal rights to education, suffrage, pay and distribution of property, as well as the same rights as men in marriage and divorce. When the panel that became the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in 1946 was forming its guiding principles, it turned to her ideas. In her work for the U.N., as in all her endeavors, Mehta took women’s participation in public and political realms to new heights. Hansa Mehta was born on July 3, 1897, in Surat (now in the northwestern state of Gujarat), to Harshadagauri and Manubhai Mehta. Her father, Manubhai, was a philosophy professor at Baroda College (now Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda); he later became the prime minister of the state of Baroda. Hansa’s paternal grandfather, Nandshankar Mehta, was headmaster of an English-language school, a civil servant and the author of the historical novel “Karan Ghelo”(1866), about the 13th-century ruler of Gujarat whose foolishness resulted in the loss of his kingdom. It is considered the first novel written in the Gujarati language. “I was fortunate enough to be born in a family which had liberal ideas on all questions of life,” Mehta said in 1972 in an oral history at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library in New Delhi. At a time when she estimated that only 2 percent of Indian women were literate, Mehta attended a high school for girls that had been set up by Baroda’s progressive ruler. She read widely, including novels by Sir Walter Scott and James Fenimore Cooper. She was one of a handful of young women to receive a bachelor’s degree, hers in philosophy, from Baroda College. Mehta continued her education in England, where she met the poet and political activist Sarojini Naidu. Naidu took her under her wing and brought her to the International Woman Suffrage Alliance conference in Geneva in 1920. Naidu “made me do things I otherwise would not have dreamt of doing,” like speaking in public, Mehta wrote in “Indian Woman,” a 1981 collection of her essays. In 1923, she traveled alone to the United States, a rare undertaking for women at the time, and visited colleges and universities to learn about American women’s education. She met Mohandas K. Gandhi when he was in jail in India in the 1920s, and in 1930 she responded to his call for women to join the freedom movement. She picketed stores that sold English rather than Indian-made cloth and helped lead protests, landing in jail three times. As a founder of the All India Women’s Conference, and later its president, Mehta tied the political struggle for India’s independence with the fight to improve the condition of her countrywomen. “If we wish to build up a democratic state, it will not pay the state to keep half the number of its citizens uneducated,” she wrote in “Indian Woman.” But she opposed special quotas; she wanted to level the playing field between men and women. Mehta was appointed to the Commission on the Status of Women in 1946 and to the Commission on Human Rights in 1947 — the same year that India gained its independence — and served until 1952. In 1946, she was one of about 15 women to join India’s Constituent Assembly, which met to write a constitution for the new nation. As an assembly member she lobbied for a civil code that would eventually supersede religious laws and ensure gender equality, and she strengthened the language on what are known as “directive principles” — guidelines that are unenforceable by the courts but nonetheless crucial in governing a multiethnic and multireligious secular democracy. In 1924, Mehta married Jivraj Mehta (a common surname in India), the chief medical officer in Baroda. The marriage was regarded as controversial because he was of a lower caste. She said in her oral history that her own community wanted to expel her from her caste, “but then I told them I was going out of the caste myself, as I did not believe in caste.” She and her husband had two children. He became the first chief minister of Gujarat in 1960 and, in 1963, the Indian high commissioner to the United Kingdom, a post equivalent to an ambassadorship. Mehta was vice chancellor of the Shreemati Nathibai Damodar Thackersey Women’s University (commonly known as S.N.D.T.) from 1946 to 1948 and vice chancellor of the University of Baroda from 1949 to 1958. At Baroda, she was the first woman to hold that title at an Indian coed university. The library there is named after her. In 2021, the U.N. held the inaugural Dr. Hansa Mehta Dialogue, a discussion on the fundamental importance of women’s empowerment. Throughout her life, Mehta wrote essays and translated stories and plays into Gujarati. She died at 98 on April 4, 1995. In the oral history, when she was asked why India, although it was largely conservative in its attitude toward women, had more women in the public and political sphere than many Western nations, Mehta spoke of Shakti, the female personification of divine power. “Historical reasons,” she replied, “because from the beginning we have always considered woman as a competent person. ‘Shakti’ — she is always worshiped as ‘Shakti.’” Radha Vatsal’s historical novel “No. 10 Doyers Street,” about a woman journalist from India who becomes embroiled in the case of a Chinatown gangster in 1900s New York,

nytimes,A Matter of Survival as South Asia’s Heat Wave Reaches 127 Degrees,"May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/world/asia/pakistan-india-heat-wave.html,"As South Asia bakes under a blistering heat wave, life-or-death decisions arrive with the midday sun. Abideen Khan and his 10-year-old son need every penny of the $3.50 a day they can make molding mud into bricks at a kiln under the open sky in Jacobabad, a city in southern Pakistan. But as temperatures have soared as high as 126 degrees Fahrenheit, or 52 degrees Celsius, in recent days, they have been forced to stop by 1 p.m., cutting their earnings in half. “This isn’t heat,” said Mr. Khan, sweat dripping down his face and soaking through his worn clothes. “It’s a punishment, maybe from God.” It is yet another brutal summer in the age of climate change, in a part of the world that is among the most vulnerable to its dire effects. And there is more suffering to come: The extreme heat that Pakistan and neighboring India have been experiencing will continue for days or weeks, forecasters say. Already, it has exacted a deadly toll. In the northern Indian state of Bihar, officials said that at least 14 people had died from the heat. Reports from other states in India’s north indicate that the count could be considerably higher. In both India and Pakistan, hospitals have reported large numbers of heatstroke cases. Ten of those who have died in Bihar were poll workers preparing for the voting to be held in the state on Saturday, the final day of India’s national election. To mitigate the heat, glucose and electrolytes are being distributed to polling officers, tents are being erected to provide shade and earthenware pots will provide cool water. In the state of Uttar Pradesh, at least six election security workers have died. New Delhi, where temperatures have approached 122 this week, nearly 20 degrees above normal, recorded its first official heat-related death of the year on Wednesday. In Jacobabad, long regarded as one of the hottest places on earth, the temperature reached 126 degrees on Sunday, with highs of 124 each of the following three days. About 75 miles away, the Pakistani town of Mohenjo Daro, notable for its Indus Valley civilization sites from 2500 B.C., reached 127 degrees on Sunday, just shy of a record set in 2010. The blazing temperatures compound the challenges for Pakistan, a country of 241 million people that is already grappling with economic and political turmoil. For the more than one million people who live in the Jacobabad district, life is dominated by constant efforts to find ways to cope with the heat. Blackouts lasting 12 to 20 hours a day are common, and some villages lack electricity altogether. The absence of necessities like readily available water and proper housing exacerbates the suffering. Most residents cannot afford air-conditioning or alternatives, like Chinese-made solar power batteries and chargeable fans. A solar panel to run two fans and a lightbulb costs about a month’s wages for laborers in Jacobabad. The water crisis is so severe that donkeys can be seen on the streets carrying tanks, from which residents buy enough water to fill five small plastic jerrycans for $1. Soaring demand has pushed up the price of ice, making this essential commodity even harder to find. Many of the poor have no choice but to work outside. Rice, the lifeblood of Pakistan’s agriculture, demands backbreaking labor in the fields from May to July, the hottest months. For Sahiba, a 25-year-old farmworker who uses one name, each day starts before dawn. She cooks for her family, then walks for miles with other women to reach the fields, where they toil until afternoon under the relentless sun. Nine months pregnant with her 10th child, she carries a double burden. “If we take a day or half-day break, there’s no daily wage, which means my children go hungry that night,” Ms. Sahiba said. Each summer, 25 to 30 percent of the district’s population becomes temporary climate refugees, according to community activists. Some seek refuge in Quetta, a city 185 miles north, where the heat is more bearable. Others go to the port city of Karachi, 310 miles south, which has had its own deadly heat waves but offers some relief with its less frequent blackouts. “Those who can afford it may rent houses in cooler cities, but most residents are simply too poor. They struggle to survive under makeshift tents erected in the open sky,” said Jan Odhano, head of the Community Development Foundation, a Jacobabad-based organization that helps the poor cope with the heat. Jansher Khoso, a 38-year-old garment worker, knows this struggle all too well. In 2018, his mother went to the hospital with heatstroke as temperatures spiked in Jacobabad. Now, every April, he sends his family to Quetta, where they remain until the autumn, while he works in Karachi. But this comes at a steep price. “I work for 16 hours in Karachi to afford the expense of this temporary migration,” Mr. Khoso said, “because I don’t want any of my family members to die in the cruel heat of Jacobabad.” Jacobabad’s suffering has not been limited to high temperatures. In 2022, monsoon rains and devastating floods — linked to erratic weather patterns associated with climate change — submerged the district and about a third of Pakistan overall, killing at least 1,700 people. The heat is nothing new in the city, which was named after John Jacob, a British brigadier general who experienced its harsh climate firsthand in the 19th century. Leading a small force to quell rebel tribes and bandits, General Jacob lost a lieutenant and seven soldiers to the heat on the first day of a 10-mile march.

nytimes,"Wall Street Lands on India, Looking for Profits It Can’t Find in China","May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/business/india-foreign-investors.html,"Mumbai, India’s financial capital, has seen a lot of new faces over the past year. The heads of global banks have been trooping through, visiting its stock exchanges, buying property and hiring new staff. A postpandemic boom has pushed the value of India’s stock market to about $5 trillion, putting it neck and neck with Hong Kong’s. India’s economy is among the fastest growing in the world. Wall Street can’t ignore India anymore. The point of entry is Mumbai, a port city of 26 million people, counting its suburbs. Mumbai has been given a makeover: Suspension bridges span its seaways, as well as its infamous slums, and new metro lines have been carved beneath its Art Deco and Indo-Saracenic facades and rumbling commuter railways. Mumbai has been India’s commercial hub for eight decades, but it was relatively unfamiliar to global finance until the past two years. Now North American pension managers, sovereign wealth funds from the Persian Gulf and Singapore, Japanese banks and private equity firms are clamoring for a piece of India’s growth. Old hands and novices alike can rattle off reasons India’s rise is inevitable. Making money will be easier said than done, not least because Indian investors got here first. Compared with Indian companies’ current profits, their stock prices are high. Foreign investors have yet to throw in their full financial weight. Mumbai’s markets were jittery in May, as Narendra Modi, the pro-business prime minister, fought for re-election. He is expected to win, but uncertainties have made far-flung investors feel cautious. Despite all the hot money pouring into the Mumbai markets, India remains a tricky place for foreign companies to navigate, making direct investment risky. Demand for spending by India’s potentially vast base of consumers has been lagging expectations — the top of the income ladder is spending more than ever, while hundreds of millions of people are stuck near the bottom. The simple reason for investors’ enthusiasm is India’s economy, which has strengths other big emerging economies are currently lacking. Foreign clients, an Indian bank executive said, “gravitate to India because it is showing reliable growth, its currency is stable, it’s showing fiscal discipline.” He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he works closely with the government. If India looks better to global investors, China and Russia look worse. China’s miraculous growth engine is sputtering, after three decades at full throttle, with threats of trade wars becoming routine. And Russia was effectively crossed off some lists of viable emerging economies after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the sanctions imposed on it by the United States, Europe and their allies. That is one reason, the banker said, investors pushed Wall Street to make it easier to bet big sums of money on India. The MSCI, an influential stock index of emerging markets started by Morgan Stanley, has increased India’s weighting to more than 18 percent, from 8 percent in 2020, while reducing China’s representation. It’s not just stocks: In June, JPMorgan Chase will add Indian government bonds to its emerging-markets index. Both changes mean that mutual funds are buying more Indian financial assets. Aashish Agarwal, India country head for the investment bank Jefferies, has been doing deals in Mumbai for more than 20 years. He said the case for investing in India was a no-brainer: Indian stocks are outperforming China’s. India’s markets also draw on a wider range of companies than many other emerging economies, he said. “You can’t think of Korea without Samsung, or Latin America without commodities,” Mr. Agarwal said. “India, as an index, is arguably the most balanced you might find outside of the U.S.” The view looks equally sunny to Kevin Carter from Lafayette, Calif. He founded an investment firm, called EMQQ Global, that sells exchange-traded funds, which make it easy for ordinary people to invest in emerging markets. The value of one fund that focuses on India’s internet and e-commerce sectors has grown nearly 40 percent in the past year. India, he said, has the makings of what historically has helped emerging markets to succeed: a large population, especially of young people, and economic growth that is causing people to spend more. With 1.4 billion people and counting, India is the world’s most populous country. Most Indians are working age or will be soon, unlike residents of Europe or East Asia. India’s economic growth rate, which hovered around 7 percent for the past couple of years, has compared favorably with a world average of 3.2 percent. On Friday, on the eve of the election’s last day, India’s central bank delivered a happy surprise. Growth in the most recent quarter was even higher than economists expected, giving the past fiscal year an official rate of 8.2 percent. Still, for some investors, there is an air of déjà vu. They remember a time almost 15 years ago when India was last thought to be ready to overtake China’s rate of economic growth. Those who bought the India hype then ended up disappointed. From 2008 to 2020, China’s per-capita income quadrupled while India’s grew by 2.5 times. That left India poor compared with the rest of the world. The latest calculation by the International Monetary Fund placed India at 138 in national rankings of income, between the Republic of Congo and Nicaragua. China was in 65th place. But India is moving up, a lot faster than China can. Along the way, India is spending heavily on public infrastructure, a hallmark of Mr. Modi’s policies in 10 years in office. In Mumbai itself, there were just three skyscrapers in 2008 — it will have sprouted hundreds by the end of this year. The city’s center of gravity has shifted from its downtown to the purpose-built Bandra Kurla Complex, or BKC, a midtown sprawl of concrete spaghetti. The One BKC tower, home to Bank of America and Switzerland’s insurance giant Swiss Re, as well as many others, was bought by Blackstone, the world’s biggest private-equity group, for a reported $300 million in 2019. Mumbai, of course, is also home to the stock market, which has attracted the savings of India’s own rapidly expanding investor class. Banks have made it easier for middle-income Indian families to invest directly. So many newbie investors have lost money on the risky trading of derivatives — investment securities tied to other securities — that the regulators want to rein them back in. A stiffer test for India’s economy will be whether it can draw more foreign direct investment — the buying up of whole chunks of private businesses by investors or companies. Nivruti Rai, managing director of Invest India, a joint venture between the commerce ministry and private chambers of commerce, is trying to ease the way. Ms. Rai is well positioned for the job, having spent nearly 30 years at Intel, spanning India and America. “I am a woman, I come from tech, from a multinational,” she said, “and I’m based in India. All this sends a message.” More longer-term foreign funding would help strengthen and stabilize the Indian rupee. Investors who make such financial commitments also tend to bring technical expertise. “We may be missing on capital and, in some places, we may be missing on technology,” she said. Ms. Rai has a lofty target — $100 billion in foreign direct investment. That’s higher than what India drew in 2021, which was a record, and much higher than it is now. The inflow sank 16.8 percent last year to just over $28 billion. Foreign investment shrank in many spots around the world in 2023, but India, like China, was hit especially hard. Ms. Rai nonetheless foresees a new cycle of investment activity centered on Indian companies in health care technology, clean energy and artificial intelligence. Mr. Modi has promised a tenfold increase in India’s economy by 2047, in time for the 100th anniversary of its independence. To get there, Ms. Rai noted, the country will need an even faster rate of growth, and that means more of “these investors that we’re trying to draw in.”",mumbai india financial capital seen lot new

nytimes,"Millions of Indians Living Abroad Have a Say in the Election, Even if They Can’t Vote","May 30, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/world/asia/india-election-diaspora-expats.html,"The dishes at a community center potluck for Indian expatriates near Washington, D.C., ranged from chana masala, a popular northern Indian chickpea curry, to idli, a southern Indian rice cake. The guests’ views on India’s general election were equally varied. Some praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic achievements. Supporters of candidates challenging Mr. Modi’s party criticized what they saw as his disregard for minorities and democratic norms. “What is the vision for India in 2024?” the host, Somu Kumar, a manager at a cloud computing company, said recently of that winter potluck. “That gets a lot of people excited to talk.” India’s 35 million-member diaspora, roughly equivalent in population to Delhi’s metropolitan area, represents a tiny minority compared with the nearly one billion people who are eligible to take part in a six-week voting process that ends on Saturday. Expatriate Indians also cannot cast absentee ballots under India’s electoral laws. But the diaspora is heavily courted by India’s main political parties. Many of its members are from the country’s political and business elites, and voters back home want to know what they think. “When a person is abroad, people take interest and believe what they say is right,” said Adapa Prasad, the president of the American branch of Mr. Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The result, he said, is that the 10,000 or so B.J.P. volunteers in the United States alone can reach tens of thousands of voters. This spring, Indians around the world have been hosting gatherings and rallies for their preferred political parties. Many Indians abroad are proud of India’s rise and associate Mr. Modi with it. So much of the recent activity has supported his bid for a third term. In the United States, which the Indian government says is home to more than five million people of Indian origin, there have been pro-Modi rallies at Times Square, the Washington Monument, the Golden Gate Bridge and other landmarks. “Save India,” some of the pro-Modi posters said. Pro-Modi groups have also set up phone banks and held other events. In a Chicago suburb last month, Modi supporters wearing the B.J.P.’s saffron tassels lit a bonfire next to a Hindu school as part of a sacred fire ritual. India’s Hindu majority is a key constituency for Mr. Modi, who has been criticized for normalizing Hindu-nationalist policies in a country born as a secular republic. In Australia, a caravan of cars draped in saffron flags stretched for miles through Sydney in April. In Germany, Modi supporters who own restaurants in Berlin and Munich have been hosting gatherings for B.J.P. supporters, said Arun Varma, an entrepreneur who founded an e-commerce brand there. And in Britain, people have been visiting Hindu temples, as well as mosques and churches, to offer prayers for Mr. Modi’s electoral success, said Neil Lal, the chairman and president of the Indian Council of Scotland and the United Kingdom. “The election is the talk of the town,” Mr. Lal said from London. Mr. Modi has actively cultivated the diaspora’s support over the years, in part by filling stadiums around the world for rallies. A 2020 study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think tank in Washington, found that a majority of Indians abroad supported him over his rivals. Milan Vaishnav, a political scientist at Carnegie who studies India’s diaspora, said that expatriate Indians were a marginal force in Indian politics and that their campaign donations, while difficult to quantify, were small compared with the billions of dollars raised at home. “But gatherings of the diaspora have helped the B.J.P. create an image of global popularity,” he said. The B.J.P. isn’t the only party active outside India. The overseas arm of its main rival, the Indian National Congress, organizes events, distributes campaign posters and helps to place columns in newspapers. The Aam Aadmi Party, which is part of a parliamentary coalition led by the Congress Party, has overseas members who run phone banks and spread friendly memes about its candidates. Mr. Kumar, an Aam Aadmi supporter, said there was growing concern in the diaspora about a potential third Modi term. He said expatriates watching India worry about the recent marginalization of religious minorities, the assassination of a separatist and the jailings of opposition politicians. Some of the people who attend his potlucks, many of whom he plays cricket with, are stalwart Modi backers. Others are onetime Modi supporters who now question whether he should be re-elected. “I hope this also translates back toward India,” Mr. Kumar said. Outside of the main parties, independent activists who live abroad have criticized the government in ways that would be difficult in India, where Mr. Modi’s government has cracked down on dissent and jailed opposition leaders. One of those activists, Suresh Ediga, an Indian expatriate in New Jersey, organizes meetings on election reform and runs a blog that fact checks Indian politicians. “Independent institutions have collapsed under Modi,” he said. “That is more alarming than anything else.” While many in the diaspora have thrown themselves into campaigning, others have taken a more hands-off approach. Lion Hina Trivedi, a prominent social worker from Gujarat, the Indian state where Mr. Modi served as chief minister from 2001 to 2014, has known him for decades and met him on his trips to Washington. She said that after more than 45 years in Chicago, she was now more invested in her American community. But she still urges the Indians she knows to travel back home to vote, recalling her father’s advice: “Never forget about India.” “You should go,” she tells them. “Your voice matters.”",dish community center potluck indian expatriate near washington dc ranged chana masala popular northern indian chickpea curry idli southern indian rice cake guest view india general election equally varied praised prime minister narendra modis economic achievement supporter candidate challenging mr modis party criticized saw disregard minority democratic norm vision india host somu kumar manager cloud computing company said recently winter potluck get lot people excited talk india millionmember diaspora roughly equivalent population delhi metropolitan area represents tiny minority compared nearly one billion people eligible take part sixweek voting process end saturday expatriate indian also cast absentee ballot india electoral law diaspora heavily courted india main political party many member country political business elite voter back home want know think person abroad people take interest believe say right said adapa prasad president american branch mr modis ruling bharatiya janata party result said bjp volunteer united state alone reach ten thousand voter spring indian around world hosting gathering rally preferred political party many indian abroad proud india rise associate mr modi much recent activity supported bid third term united state indian government say home five million people indian origin promodi rally time square washington monument golden gate bridge landmark save india promodi poster said promodi group also set phone bank held event chicago suburb last month modi supporter wearing bjps saffron tassel lit bonfire next hindu school part sacred fire ritual india hindu majority key constituency mr modi criticized normalizing hindunationalist policy country born secular republic australia caravan car draped saffron flag stretched mile sydney april germany modi supporter restaurant berlin munich hosting gathering bjp supporter said arun varma entrepreneur founded ecommerce brand britain people visiting hindu temple well mosque church offer prayer mr modis electoral success said neil lal chairman president indian council scotland united kingdom election talk town mr lal said london mr modi actively cultivated diaspora support year part filling stadium around world rally study carnegie endowment international peace think tank washington found majority indian abroad supported rival milan vaishnav political scientist carnegie study india diaspora said expatriate indian marginal force indian politics campaign donation difficult quantify small compared billion dollar raised home gathering diaspora helped bjp create image global popularity said bjp isnt party active outside india overseas arm main rival indian national congress organizes event distributes campaign poster help place column newspaper aam aadmi party part parliamentary coalition led congress party overseas member run phone bank spread friendly meme candidate mr kumar aam aadmi supporter said growing concern diaspora potential third modi term said expatriate watching india worry recent marginalization religious minority assassination separatist jailings opposition politician people attend potluck many play cricket stalwart modi backer others onetime modi supporter question whether reelected hope also translates back toward india mr kumar said outside main party independent activist live abroad criticized government way would difficult india mr modis government cracked dissent jailed opposition leader one activist suresh ediga indian expatriate new jersey organizes meeting election reform run blog fact check indian politician independent institution collapsed modi said alarming anything else many diaspora thrown campaigning others taken handsoff approach lion hina trivedi prominent social worker gujarat indian state mr modi served chief minister known decade met trip washington said year chicago invested american community still urge indian know travel back home vote recalling father advice never forget india go tell voice matter
nytimes,New Delhi Sweats Through Its Hottest Recorded Day,"May 29, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/world/asia/india-delhi-hottest-day-ever.html,"New Delhi recorded its highest temperature ever measured on Wednesday — 126 degrees Fahrenheit, or 52.3 degrees Celsius — leaving residents of the Indian capital sweltering in a heat wave that has kept temperatures in several Indian states well above 110 degrees for weeks. In New Delhi, where walking out of the house felt like walking into an oven, officials feared that the electricity grid was being overwhelmed and that the city’s water supply might need rationing. The past 12 months have been the planet’s hottest ever recorded, and cities like Miami are experiencing extreme heat even before the arrival of summer. Scientists said this week that the average person on Earth had experienced 26 more days of abnormally high temperatures in the past year than would have been the case without human-induced climate change. Extreme heat can cause serious health issues and can be fatal. Although late-afternoon dust storms and light drizzle in New Delhi had brought hope of some reprieve on Wednesday, the weather station at Mungeshpur, northwest of the capital, reported a recording of 126 degrees around 2:30 p.m. Dr. Kuldeep Srivastava, a scientist at the regional meteorological center in Delhi, said it was the highest temperature ever recorded by the automatic weather monitoring system, which was installed in 2010. In a statement later on Wednesday evening, India’s meteorological department said the Mungeshpur station was “an outlier compared to other stations.” It said it was assessing whether that station’s recording of a higher temperature than other stations around Delhi was due to an error or a local mitigating factor. The previous record for the highest temperature, around 48 degrees Celsius — about 118.5 Fahrenheit — was repeatedly crossed in recent days. Three of New Delhi’s weather stations reported temperatures of 49.8 degree Celsius — 121.8 degrees Fahrenheit — or higher on Tuesday, setting a new record even before the 52.3 degree reading on Wednesday afternoon. For weeks now, temperatures in several states in India’s north have reached well over 110 degrees, and hospitals have been reporting an uptick in cases of heatstroke. In the Himalayan states, hundreds of forest fires have been reported. Deadly fires in crowded buildings are regular occurrences in India, with many of them caused by short circuits. The rising temperatures have increased concerns about the risks. Atul Garg, Delhi’s fire chief, said daily fire-related calls have crossed 200, the highest in the past decade. “Normally during this period in the last eight to 10 years we would receive 160 calls per day,” Mr. Garg said. “We are stretched in terms of manpower.” The heat wave has coincided with campaigning for India’s general election, with the last phase of voting set to take place on June 1. Candidates, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and opposition leaders, have continued holding large public rallies, despite the temperatures. Nitin Gadkari, a cabinet minister who is running for re-election, fainted from the heat while addressing a rally, and on Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi, the opposition leader, took a break during a speech to pour water from a bottle onto his head. “It’s quite hot, no?” he said. To help conserve water amid the extreme heat, Atishi Marlena, Delhi’s water minister, announced the deployment of 200 teams to crack down on waste and misuse. Fines will be imposed for activities such as washing cars with hoses, “overflow of water tanks” and “use of domestic water for construction or commercial” purposes, she said. Delhi’s lieutenant governor, V.K. Saxena, ordered measures to protect construction workers during the midday heat, and for water to be provided at bus stands. The state broadcaster reported that Mr. Saxena, who was appointed by Mr. Modi, had also called for construction workers to get “paid leave” between noon and 3 p.m. But it did not say how that would be implemented, particularly at a moment when the capital region’s administration is paralyzed by infighting between its lieutenant governor and the elected chief minister. Just how much the heat has affected daily life in the Indian capital was captured in the adjournment order of a consumer dispute court last week when the most intense period of the heat wave began. The presiding official, Suresh Kumar Gupta, complained that the room had no air-conditioning, and the water supply in the bathrooms was also affected. “There is too much heat in the courtroom, which led to sweating, as such it is difficult to hear arguments,” he said in the order. “In these circumstances, arguments cannot be heard, so case is adjourned.” Jitender Singh, 42, an auto rickshaw driver in the eastern part of the city, said that business was down by about a third because people were avoiding leaving their homes. He said he and his colleagues had frequently fallen sick. “But we must come on the road to support our families,” he added.",new delhi recorded highest temperature ever measured wednesday degree fahrenheit degree celsius leaving resident indian capital sweltering heat wave kept temperature several indian state well degree week new delhi walking house felt like walking oven official feared electricity grid overwhelmed city water supply might need rationing past month planet hottest ever recorded city like miami experiencing extreme heat even arrival summer scientist said week average person earth experienced day abnormally high temperature past year would case without humaninduced climate change extreme heat cause serious health issue fatal although lateafternoon dust storm light drizzle new delhi brought hope reprieve wednesday weather station mungeshpur northwest capital reported recording degree around pm dr kuldeep srivastava scientist regional meteorological center delhi said highest temperature ever recorded automatic weather monitoring system installed statement later wednesday evening india meteorological department said mungeshpur station outlier compared station said assessing whether station recording higher temperature station around delhi due error local mitigating factor previous record highest temperature around degree celsius fahrenheit repeatedly crossed recent day three new delhi weather station reported temperature degree celsius degree fahrenheit higher tuesday setting new record even degree reading wednesday afternoon week temperature several state india north reached well degree hospital reporting uptick case heatstroke himalayan state hundred forest fire reported deadly fire crowded building regular occurrence india many caused short circuit rising temperature increased concern risk atul garg delhi fire chief said daily firerelated call crossed highest past decade normally period last eight year would receive call per day mr garg said stretched term manpower heat wave coincided campaigning india general election last phase voting set take place june candidate including prime minister narendra modi opposition leader continued holding large public rally despite temperature nitin gadkari cabinet minister running reelection fainted heat addressing rally tuesday rahul gandhi opposition leader took break speech pour water bottle onto head quite hot said help conserve water amid extreme heat atishi marlena delhi water minister announced deployment team crack waste misuse fine imposed activity washing car hose overflow water tank use domestic water construction commercial purpose said delhi lieutenant governor vk saxena ordered measure protect construction worker midday heat water provided bus stand state broadcaster reported mr saxena appointed mr modi also called construction worker get paid leave noon pm say would implemented particularly moment capital region administration paralyzed infighting lieutenant governor elected chief minister much heat affected daily life indian capital captured adjournment order consumer dispute court last week intense period heat wave began presiding official suresh kumar gupta complained room airconditioning water supply bathroom also affected much heat courtroom led sweating difficult hear argument said order circumstance argument heard case adjourned jitender singh auto rickshaw driver eastern part city said business third people avoiding leaving home said colleague frequently fallen sick must come road support family added
nytimes,India y Bangladés: el ciclón Remal arrasa y deja al menos 23 muertos,"May 28, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/05/28/espanol/ciclon-remal-banglades-india.html,"[Estamos en WhatsApp. Empieza a seguirnos ahora] Al menos 23 personas fallecieron y millones se quedaron sin electricidad después de que el ciclón Remal, la primera tormenta tropical de la temporada, azotara el domingo Bangladés y la vecina India oriental. Remal, con vientos de más de 110 kilómetros por hora, dejó un rastro de destrucción, arrancando árboles y dañando el tendido eléctrico en toda la región, según las autoridades. La tormenta mató a 13 personas en Bangladés y dañó o destruyó más de 35.000 viviendas en las zonas costeras, afectando a unos 3,5 millones de personas, según las autoridades. Más de 13 millones de personas se quedaron sin electricidad el lunes por la noche, según funcionarios del Ministerio de Energía. El país del sur de Asia tiene 170 millones de habitantes. La tormenta también causó cortes de electricidad y daños en viviendas del estado indio de Bengala Occidental. El martes, las autoridades dijeron que al menos 10 personas habían muerto, y varias más estaban desaparecidas, después de que las fuertes lluvias de los remanentes del ciclón provocaran el derrumbe de una cantera en el estado indio del sur de Mizorán, vecino de Bangladés. La tormenta llegó tras semanas de intenso calor en la región, con temperaturas que alcanzaron los 40 grados centígrados. Remal tocó tierra cerca de Mongla, el puerto del sur de Bangladés, y de las vecinas islas Sagar, de India, hacia las 9 p. m. del domingo. Alrededor de un millón de personas fueron evacuadas de los pueblos costeros de Bangladés antes de que llegara la tormenta. La mayoría de esas aldeas quedaron inundadas, dejando a millones de personas vulnerables, según las autoridades. “Mientras el ciclón Remal azota las zonas costeras de Bangladés, más de 8,4 millones de personas, entre ellas 3,2 millones de niños, corren graves riesgos en materia de salud, nutrición, saneamiento y seguridad”, declaró en un comunicado Sheldon Yett, representante de UNICEF en Bangladés. La capital de Bangladés, Daca, en el interior del país, se vio afectada por lluvias torrenciales y fuertes vientos. La tormenta interrumpió los vuelos en el aeropuerto internacional Shah Amanat, en el sureste de Bangladés, y en el aeropuerto de Calcuta, en India. El martes, la tormenta se había debilitado, pero los meteorólogos de Bangladés e India advirtieron de que las lluvias torrenciales y los fuertes vientos podrían continuar durante unos días. Bangladés ha sufrido varias tormentas violentas en los últimos años. El pasado mes de mayo, un fuerte ciclón, Mocha, azotó Bangladés y Birmania y dejó varios muertos. La tormenta causó daños generalizados en los extensos campos de refugiados rohinyás de Cox’s Bazar, destruyendo más de 3000 cabañas y centros de aprendizaje construidos con tablillas de bambú y lonas de plástico.

nytimes,Man Accused in Plot to Assassinate Sikh Separatist Pleads Not Guilty,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/nyregion/nikhil-gupta-india-assassination-plot.html,"An Indian man pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of orchestrating a failed assassination plot against a Sikh separatist in New York, a plan that prosecutors say he devised on behalf of an unnamed official in India’s government. The defendant, Nikhil Gupta, 52, was arrested in the Czech Republic a year ago, and was extradited last week to make his first appearance in Manhattan federal court. He is accused of trying to arrange the murder of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American citizen and lawyer for a New York-based Sikh secessionist group. The murder attempt, which played out against a backdrop of doubt about India’s commitment to democracy, spanned several countries and mirrored the successful killing of another separatist in Canada, prosecutors say. On Monday morning, Mr. Gupta entered the Lower Manhattan courtroom in a blue cardigan and yellow patterned shirt and appeared relaxed as he spoke to his lawyer, Jeffrey Chabrowe, at the defense table. He has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since landing in the United States on Friday afternoon. In a statement to reporters after the arraignment, Mr. Chabrowe called the case a “complex matter"" for India and the United States. “Background and details will develop that may cast government allegations into an entirely new light,” he said. Mr. Gupta is charged with murder for hire and conspiracy to commit murder for hire. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison for each charge. He was sent back to the detention center after Monday’s arraignment and is set to appear in court again on June 28. In a statement Monday, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said Mr. Gupta will “now face justice” in an American courtroom. “This extradition makes clear that the Justice Department will not tolerate attempts to silence or harm American citizens,” he said. In an indictment unsealed in November, Manhattan federal prosecutors described an audacious plot that began around May 2023 when an Indian government employee enlisted Mr. Gupta to organize the killing of Mr. Pannun, who was living in New York at the time. Mr. Pannun is the general counsel of Sikhs for Justice, an organization that supports the secession of Punjab, a state in northern India. He is a vocal critic of the Indian government and has been banned from the country, prosecutors say. Mr. Gupta, who lived in India, had told the government official about “his involvement in international narcotics and weapons trafficking,” according to the indictment. At the direction of the Indian government employee, Mr. Gupta contacted a man who he believed would help him hire a hit man in New York, but who was, in fact, an agent for the American government. That agent introduced Mr. Gupta to an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration officer who pretended to be the hit man. In deals brokered by Mr. Gupta, the Indian government official agreed to pay the D.E.A. officer $100,000 to kill Mr. Pannun, including a $15,000 cash advance for the job, prosecutors said. Mr. Gupta then shared personal information about Mr. Pannun with the undercover officer, including Mr. Pannun’s address in New York and his phone number. When the Indian official asked for updates, Mr. Gupta relayed surveillance photos of Mr. Pannun that the agent had sent him. Mr. Gupta instructed the undercover officer to carry out the assassination as soon as possible, but asked him not to do it around the time of high-level meetings between U.S. and Indian officials, according to the indictment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington and met with President Biden in June 2023. Then, prosecutors said, on June 18 of that year, gunmen killed Hardeep Singh Nijjar, another Sikh separatist leader, in British Columbia, Canada. Mr. Nijjar knew Mr. Pannun and was also an outspoken critic of the Indian government. Soon after, prosecutors said, Mr. Gupta told the undercover officer that Mr. Nijjar “was also the target” and that “we have so many targets.” Mr. Gupta then told the officer — the pretend hit man — that there was “now no need to wait” to kill Mr. Pannun, prosecutors said. On Monday, Mr. Pannun said in a statement that he had “full faith” that the United States would hold Mr. Gupta and his co-conspirators accountable. “The attempt on my life on American soil is the blatant case of India’s transnational terrorism challenging America’s sovereignty and unequivocally proves that Modi’s India believes in using violence to suppress the dissenting political opinion,” he said. A spokesman for the Indian Embassy in Washington, D.C., could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. Mr. Gupta’s case has threatened to complicate the delicate relations among Washington, Ottawa and New Delhi. During his presidency, Mr. Biden has courted India’s leaders to counter the influence of Russia and China, despite growing concerns about India’s commitment to democracy. Mr. Modi, who has been in office since 2014, was re-elected as India’s prime minister in June, even as his Bharatiya Janata Party lost its majority in Parliament.",indian man pleaded guilty monday charge orchestrating failed assassination plot sikh separatist new york plan prosecutor say devised behalf unnamed official india government defendant nikhil gupta arrested czech republic year ago extradited last week make first appearance manhattan federal court accused trying arrange murder gurpatwant singh pannun american citizen lawyer new yorkbased sikh secessionist group murder attempt played backdrop doubt india commitment democracy spanned several country mirrored successful killing another separatist canada prosecutor say monday morning mr gupta entered lower manhattan courtroom blue cardigan yellow patterned shirt appeared relaxed spoke lawyer jeffrey chabrowe defense table held metropolitan detention center brooklyn since landing united state friday afternoon statement reporter arraignment mr chabrowe called case complex matter india united state background detail develop may cast government allegation entirely new light said mr gupta charged murder hire conspiracy commit murder hire convicted would face maximum year prison charge sent back detention center monday arraignment set appear court june statement monday attorney general merrick b garland said mr gupta face justice american courtroom extradition make clear justice department tolerate attempt silence harm american citizen said indictment unsealed november manhattan federal prosecutor described audacious plot began around may indian government employee enlisted mr gupta organize killing mr pannun living new york time mr pannun general counsel sikh justice organization support secession punjab state northern india vocal critic indian government banned country prosecutor say mr gupta lived india told government official involvement international narcotic weapon trafficking according indictment direction indian government employee mr gupta contacted man believed would help hire hit man new york fact agent american government agent introduced mr gupta undercover drug enforcement administration officer pretended hit man deal brokered mr gupta indian government official agreed pay dea officer kill mr pannun including cash advance job prosecutor said mr gupta shared personal information mr pannun undercover officer including mr pannuns address new york phone number indian official asked update mr gupta relayed surveillance photo mr pannun agent sent mr gupta instructed undercover officer carry assassination soon possible asked around time highlevel meeting u indian official according indictment prime minister narendra modi visited washington met president biden june prosecutor said june year gunman killed hardeep singh nijjar another sikh separatist leader british columbia canada mr nijjar knew mr pannun also outspoken critic indian government soon prosecutor said mr gupta told undercover officer mr nijjar also target many target mr gupta told officer pretend hit man need wait kill mr pannun prosecutor said monday mr pannun said statement full faith united state would hold mr gupta coconspirator accountable attempt life american soil blatant case india transnational terrorism challenging america sovereignty unequivocally prof modis india belief using violence suppress dissenting political opinion said spokesman indian embassy washington dc could immediately reached comment monday mr guptas case threatened complicate delicate relation among washington ottawa new delhi presidency mr biden courted india leader counter influence russia china despite growing concern india commitment democracy mr modi office since reelected india prime minister june even bharatiya janata party lost majority parliament
nytimes,Train Crash in India Leaves at Least 8 Dead and Dozens Injured,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/world/asia/india-train-crash.html,"A freight train collided with a passenger train in eastern India on Monday, killing at least eight people and injuring 50 others, officials said. The episode occurred at around 9 a.m. when the Kanchanjunga Express, which was carrying passengers to the state of West Bengal from the state of Tripura, was leaving the Rangapani station. Four coaches of the popular and often-crowded passenger train derailed when it was rammed from behind by the commercial train. Images from the accident site showed one of the passenger coaches lifted off the railway track and balancing on a coach of the freight train. The death toll was likely to rise. Local news outlets, citing police officials, reported at least 15 people dead. The driver and the assistant driver of the freight train and a guard on the passenger train were among those killed. Jaya Varma Sinha, the chairperson of India’s railway board, said rescue operations were completed. Ashwini Vaishnaw, India’s railway minister, was en route to the site. The relatively low number of casualties could be attributed to the fact that the rear portion of the Kanchanjunga Express, which took the biggest impact from the collision, comprised cargo coaches and the guard’s coach. Passengers were in compartments far forward from the impact. While an investigation has been ordered to look into the cause of the collision, Ms. Sinha said human error such as disregarding a railway signal could have caused the crash. The accident again brings to the fore the issue of rail safety in a country whose millions of poor residents rely on railways for transport. India’s rail network is one of the world’s largest and is crucial to the country’s economy and its people’s lives and livelihood. The country has, in recent years, invested heavily on rail safety after a long history of deadly accidents. Although the overall number of rail accidents has lessened over the past decade, incidents with mass casualties have persisted. Last June, 290 people were killed when two passenger trains collided after one of them struck a stationary freight train at full speed and derailed in the state of Odisha. After that incident, opposition leaders demanded the resignation of Mr. Vaishnaw, the railway minister. He has said he was trying to expand a safety system, called Kavach, that is meant to prevent accidents when two trains are moving on the same track. Ms. Sinha said the technology had not yet been deployed on the route of the Kanchanjunga Express.",freight train collided passenger train eastern india monday killing least eight people injuring others official said episode occurred around kanchanjunga express carrying passenger state west bengal state tripura leaving rangapani station four coach popular oftencrowded passenger train derailed rammed behind commercial train image accident site showed one passenger coach lifted railway track balancing coach freight train death toll likely rise local news outlet citing police official reported least people dead driver assistant driver freight train guard passenger train among killed jaya varma sinha chairperson india railway board said rescue operation completed ashwini vaishnaw india railway minister en route site relatively low number casualty could attributed fact rear portion kanchanjunga express took biggest impact collision comprised cargo coach guard coach passenger compartment far forward impact investigation ordered look cause collision m sinha said human error disregarding railway signal could caused crash accident brings fore issue rail safety country whose million poor resident rely railway transport india rail network one world largest crucial country economy people life livelihood country recent year invested heavily rail safety long history deadly accident although overall number rail accident lessened past decade incident mass casualty persisted last june people killed two passenger train collided one struck stationary freight train full speed derailed state odisha incident opposition leader demanded resignation mr vaishnaw railway minister said trying expand safety system called kavach meant prevent accident two train moving track m sinha said technology yet deployed route kanchanjunga express
nytimes,"G7 Leaders, Expanding the Circle, Shift Focus to Migration and the South","June 14, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/world/europe/g7-summit-ai-china-india.html,"The Group of 7 countries threw open the doors of their club on Friday to India, Brazil, Turkey and other non-Western countries, acknowledging a shifting global landscape as they tried to enlist these nations’ leaders in causes ranging from climate change to managing the economic competition with China. While diplomats from the Group of 7 hammered out a communiqué that pledged support for Ukraine in its war against Russia and greater ambition in curbing carbon emissions, the focus was on Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and other leaders from outside the G7, whose support is increasingly critical to achieving any of these goals. Among the thorny questions on the second day of the summit: migration, which has helped fuel a recent resurgence of populism and far-right parties in Europe and the United States. The leaders also discussed the war in Gaza and China’s state subsidies of industries like electric vehicles, which has prompted the United States and the European Union to impose tariffs on Chinese exports. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, who is hosting the gathering, said the goal of her expanded guest list was to “strengthen dialogue with the nations of the Global South.” She insisted that the Group of 7 was “not a fortress closed in itself” but “an offer of values that we open to the world.” Ms. Meloni recruited Pope Francis to speak to the leaders about the dangers posed by artificial intelligence. Francis urged them to regulate the technology, of which he was himself a victim when A.I.-generated fake images of him clad in a white puffer jacket and a jewel-encrusted crucifix went viral last year. “The benefits and the damages it causes will depend on the way it is used,” the pope declared, warning of the risks of A.I.’s uncontrolled development. He called for lethal autonomous weapons, which are unmanned and uncontrolled by a human hand, to be banned, saying, “No machine should ever decide whether to take the life of a human being away.” The pope’s appearance was the emotional highlight of a day of carefully staged summitry that seemed to concede that the West is less dominant demographically and economically than in the past — and that it is listening to calls for more equity and balance in global decision-making. As Ms. Meloni guided the pope, in a wheelchair, around a circular table to meet the leaders, he was greeted by a visibly moved President Biden and got an enthusiastic hug from Argentina’s flamboyant president, Javier Milei, whose election last November was viewed as another sign of the rising tide of populism across the Americas and Europe. This is not the first time non-Western leaders have been invited to a Group of 7 meeting, but rarely have they been so conspicuous. In part that reflects the issues that Ms. Meloni has highlighted: Africa and the Mediterranean. The leaders of Algeria, Kenya and Tunisia were on hand at a luxury resort hotel on Italy’s southern coast, as was President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. “Inviting key developing country leaders reflects the reality that confronting China and Russia requires the cooperation of more than the G7,” said Daniel M. Price, who was a top trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “And Brazil, India and Turkey are as concerned about Chinese predatory trade practices and overcapacity as are Japan, Europe and the U.S.” The final G7 communiqué voiced concern about what the leaders called China’s “persistent industrial targeting and comprehensive nonmarket policies and practices that are leading to global spillovers, market distortions and harmful overcapacity.” The communiqué endorsed Mr. Biden’s effort to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. France and Canada had pushed for stronger language on Israel’s conduct of the war, according to people familiar with the negotiations, but the United States and Germany resisted. In a victory for Ms. Meloni, a conservative who opposes abortion, the communiqué did not include an explicit reference to abortion, in a passage that pledged to promote “comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.” A communiqué released by the Group of 7 leaders after their last summit in Hiroshima, Japan, referred specifically to abortion rights. The issue injected a briefly discordant note into the gathering after President Emmanuel Macron of France told an Italian journalist that some politicians did not share France’s “vision of equality between women and men.” Ms. Meloni criticized Mr. Macron, who recently called a snap parliamentary election, as seeking to politicize the issue at a “precious forum like the G7.” For the most part, however, the meeting underscored harmony among the leaders, many of whom are embattled by their own domestic politics. It also served as a platform for Ms. Meloni, 47, who has overcome initial qualms about her political roots in a party built on the ashes of fascism to win respect for her steadfast support of Ukraine. Presiding over the two days of meetings, she was able to put a spotlight on several of her pet issues. How to control migration has vexed the United States and Europe, compounded by the effects of climate change and warfare in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Ukraine. It is a particularly delicate issue for Ms. Meloni, who has campaigned hard to fight what she has called “uncontrolled immigration” to Italy and other parts of Europe from Africa and the Middle East. While Europe has welcomed thousands of Ukrainians, especially women and children, fleeing the Russian invasion, Ukrainian officials have urged European countries to help them repatriate men of fighting age. “Turkey is a critical player on global migration,” said Peter Westmacott, who served as Britain’s ambassador to Turkey, France and the United States. He noted that there are about three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds and Afghans. “If Europe wants to control migration from these countries,” Mr. Westmacott said, “Turkey is an indispensable partner.” Mr. Erdogan, he said, could also yet play a role in brokering an end to Ukraine’s war with Russia. As a Black Sea power, Turkey has kept open its commercial and political links to Russia. But it is also a NATO member and has supplied cheap, highly effective drones to help the Ukrainian resistance. Some of the invitations reflected diplomatic protocol, according to Italian officials. Brazil, India and South Africa were automatically included as current or future presidents of the Group of 20 industrialized nations. Argentina was invited, these officials said, because Mr. Milei has recognized the connections and interdependence between East and West. He and Ms. Meloni have also cultivated close personal ties, sharing a right-wing populism that includes opposition to abortion and gay rights.",group country threw open door club friday india brazil turkey nonwestern country acknowledging shifting global landscape tried enlist nation leader cause ranging climate change managing economic competition china diplomat group hammered communiqu pledged support ukraine war russia greater ambition curbing carbon emission focus prime minister narendra modi india president luiz incio lula da silva brazil leader outside g whose support increasingly critical achieving goal among thorny question second day summit migration helped fuel recent resurgence populism farright party europe united state leader also discussed war gaza china state subsidy industry like electric vehicle prompted united state european union impose tariff chinese export prime minister giorgia meloni italy hosting gathering said goal expanded guest list strengthen dialogue nation global south insisted group fortress closed offer value open world m meloni recruited pope francis speak leader danger posed artificial intelligence francis urged regulate technology victim aigenerated fake image clad white puffer jacket jewelencrusted crucifix went viral last year benefit damage cause depend way used pope declared warning risk ai uncontrolled development called lethal autonomous weapon unmanned uncontrolled human hand banned saying machine ever decide whether take life human away pope appearance emotional highlight day carefully staged summitry seemed concede west le dominant demographically economically past listening call equity balance global decisionmaking m meloni guided pope wheelchair around circular table meet leader greeted visibly moved president biden got enthusiastic hug argentina flamboyant president javier milei whose election last november viewed another sign rising tide populism across america europe first time nonwestern leader invited group meeting rarely conspicuous part reflects issue m meloni highlighted africa mediterranean leader algeria kenya tunisia hand luxury resort hotel italy southern coast president recep tayyip erdogan turkey inviting key developing country leader reflects reality confronting china russia requires cooperation g said daniel price top trade adviser president george w bush brazil india turkey concerned chinese predatory trade practice overcapacity japan europe u final g communiqu voiced concern leader called china persistent industrial targeting comprehensive nonmarket policy practice leading global spillover market distortion harmful overcapacity communiqu endorsed mr bidens effort broker ceasefire israel hamas gaza france canada pushed stronger language israel conduct war according people familiar negotiation united state germany resisted victory m meloni conservative opposes abortion communiqu include explicit reference abortion passage pledged promote comprehensive sexual reproductive health right communiqu released group leader last summit hiroshima japan referred specifically abortion right issue injected briefly discordant note gathering president emmanuel macron france told italian journalist politician share france vision equality woman men m meloni criticized mr macron recently called snap parliamentary election seeking politicize issue precious forum like g part however meeting underscored harmony among leader many embattled domestic politics also served platform m meloni overcome initial qualm political root party built ash fascism win respect steadfast support ukraine presiding two day meeting able put spotlight several pet issue control migration vexed united state europe compounded effect climate change warfare afghanistan middle east ukraine particularly delicate issue m meloni campaigned hard fight called uncontrolled immigration italy part europe africa middle east europe welcomed thousand ukrainian especially woman child fleeing russian invasion ukrainian official urged european country help repatriate men fighting age turkey critical player global migration said peter westmacott served britain ambassador turkey france united state noted three million syrian refugee turkey well hundred thousand iraqi kurd afghan europe want control migration country mr westmacott said turkey indispensable partner mr erdogan said could also yet play role brokering end ukraine war russia black sea power turkey kept open commercial political link russia also nato member supplied cheap highly effective drone help ukrainian resistance invitation reflected diplomatic protocol according italian official brazil india south africa automatically included current future president group industrialized nation argentina invited official said mr milei recognized connection interdependence east west m meloni also cultivated close personal tie sharing rightwing populism includes opposition abortion gay right
nytimes,Fire in Kuwait Worker Housing Leaves at Least 49 Dead,"June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/world/middleeast/fire-kuwait-migrant-worker-housing.html,"At least 49 people were killed and dozens of others injured in the Persian Gulf country of Kuwait, the state news agency said, when a fire broke out on Wednesday in a building that housed scores of low-income workers, many of them Indian nationals. The fire began during the morning in a coastal area called Mangaf, about half an hour’s drive from the center of the capital, Kuwait City. The Kuwaiti authorities have held the building owner for questioning as they investigate the cause of the fire and try to determine whether “any shortcoming or neglect” played a role, the state news agency reported. The authorities promised to begin a campaign to tackle building code violations. The public prosecutor’s office also planned to inspect the site and interview survivors. Speaking to journalists at the site of the fire, Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Al Sabah — Kuwait’s deputy prime minister and interior minister — blamed “the greed of property owners” for the disaster and said that the owner of the company employing the workers would also be detained, the Reuters news agency and Kuwaiti newspapers reported. Jayashankar, an Indian salesman who survived the fire, said that he awoke to screams around 4 a.m. local time. He and his roommates opened the door to their fourth-floor apartment and found that thick black smoke had enveloped the corridor, burning their lungs, he said in a phone interview, asking to be identified by his first name only for fear of retribution. Instead of trying to escape, he said, they locked the door, opened a window and waited for help. Two of his roommates who left the apartment to find an exit later died, he said. Witnesses told local news outlets that the fire had begun at the bottom of the seven-story building, sending smoke billowing upward. In a televised interview, an official in Kuwait’s firefighting force, Col. Sayed Hassan Al-Moussawi, said, “In a building like this, you’re supposed to go up to the roof, but unfortunately the door to the roof was locked.” Ramesh, an Indian worker who lives in a building next door and who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said in an interview that he saw people trying to jump out of windows to escape. The fire’s high death toll highlighted the perils faced by low-income immigrants to Gulf countries, who often toil under exploitative contracts and live in overcrowded housing, with regulatory protections that are limited or poorly enforced. Foreigners make up about two-thirds of the population of Kuwait, an oil-rich nation with one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds. Many are low-paid workers from South Asian countries who perform jobs including construction, restaurant service and street cleaning. More than 50 people hurt during the fire were sent to hospitals around Kuwait, with injuries including burns, broken bones from jumping out of the building and carbon monoxide poisoning from smoke inhalation, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. Nine were in critical condition, it said. Many of the workers affected were from India, the country’s embassy in Kuwait said on social media. On Wednesday, India’s ambassador to Kuwait, Adarsh Swaika, visited several hospitals where workers were taken, the embassy said in its posts. In a post on X, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India said that the fire was “saddening” and that the Indian Embassy would monitor the situation closely and work with the authorities “to assist the affected.” In a video published by the Kuwaiti news media, Sheikh Fahad was shown at the location of the fire, questioning an unidentified man about who lived in the building. The man told him that 196 people had lived there. The video cut off after Sheikh Fahad told the authorities to detain the man for questioning. Officials working in the municipality overseeing the area were also suspended from work pending an investigation, Kuwait’s state news agency reported. Building codes in Gulf countries are often laxly put in place, and smoke detectors and fire escapes are not common in residential properties. At the site of the fire on Wednesday afternoon, municipal employees were already putting up notices of violations on nearby buildings, including for partitioning rooms with gypsum board. Mangaf is predominantly inhabited by migrant workers, with apartment blocks housing men from India, Bangladesh and Egypt. Interviewed by The New York Times near the fire location, workers who lived nearby gave varying accounts of the numbers of men typically housed in each room, ranging from three to 12. Jayashankar, the survivor, said that nine people, all Indians, had shared his three-bedroom apartment. The building bore a sign saying it was a workers’ camp for a company called NBTC Group, a contracting firm headquartered in Kuwait with business in construction, industry, logistics and related fields. Phone calls to the company on Wednesday went unanswered, and an employee at the company’s offices said that staff members had been detained by officials that day. Another Indian worker who lived on the second floor of the building said that he and his roommates had survived because they had been out working an overnight shift. The worker, Sami, 45, who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said he had not yet been able to go inside to retrieve his belongings and inspect the damage because the police had closed off entrances to the building. Shahrukh Kha, who is from Bihar, India, said that he had spent all day trying to reach his brother, Kalu, who lived in the building, but that his brother’s phone was off. “We have not gotten any kind of information about whether he is injured or dead,” he said in a phone interview. Kalu Kha, a 30-year-old salesman who works in a fruit and vegetable shop, had been planning to travel home to India next month, his brother said; his wedding date is set for July 22.",least people killed dozen others injured persian gulf country kuwait state news agency said fire broke wednesday building housed score lowincome worker many indian national fire began morning coastal area called mangaf half hour drive center capital kuwait city kuwaiti authority held building owner questioning investigate cause fire try determine whether shortcoming neglect played role state news agency reported authority promised begin campaign tackle building code violation public prosecutor office also planned inspect site interview survivor speaking journalist site fire sheikh fahad yusuf al sabah kuwait deputy prime minister interior minister blamed greed property owner disaster said owner company employing worker would also detained reuters news agency kuwaiti newspaper reported jayashankar indian salesman survived fire said awoke scream around local time roommate opened door fourthfloor apartment found thick black smoke enveloped corridor burning lung said phone interview asking identified first name fear retribution instead trying escape said locked door opened window waited help two roommate left apartment find exit later died said witness told local news outlet fire begun bottom sevenstory building sending smoke billowing upward televised interview official kuwait firefighting force col sayed hassan almoussawi said building like youre supposed go roof unfortunately door roof locked ramesh indian worker life building next door also asked identified first name fear retribution said interview saw people trying jump window escape fire high death toll highlighted peril faced lowincome immigrant gulf country often toil exploitative contract live overcrowded housing regulatory protection limited poorly enforced foreigner make twothirds population kuwait oilrich nation one world largest sovereign wealth fund many lowpaid worker south asian country perform job including construction restaurant service street cleaning people hurt fire sent hospital around kuwait injury including burn broken bone jumping building carbon monoxide poisoning smoke inhalation ministry health said statement nine critical condition said many worker affected india country embassy kuwait said social medium wednesday india ambassador kuwait adarsh swaika visited several hospital worker taken embassy said post post x prime minister narendra modi india said fire saddening indian embassy would monitor situation closely work authority assist affected video published kuwaiti news medium sheikh fahad shown location fire questioning unidentified man lived building man told people lived video cut sheikh fahad told authority detain man questioning official working municipality overseeing area also suspended work pending investigation kuwait state news agency reported building code gulf country often laxly put place smoke detector fire escape common residential property site fire wednesday afternoon municipal employee already putting notice violation nearby building including partitioning room gypsum board mangaf predominantly inhabited migrant worker apartment block housing men india bangladesh egypt interviewed new york time near fire location worker lived nearby gave varying account number men typically housed room ranging three jayashankar survivor said nine people indian shared threebedroom apartment building bore sign saying worker camp company called nbtc group contracting firm headquartered kuwait business construction industry logistics related field phone call company wednesday went unanswered employee company office said staff member detained official day another indian worker lived second floor building said roommate survived working overnight shift worker sami also asked identified first name fear retribution said yet able go inside retrieve belonging inspect damage police closed entrance building shahrukh kha bihar india said spent day trying reach brother kalu lived building brother phone gotten kind information whether injured dead said phone interview kalu kha yearold salesman work fruit vegetable shop planning travel home india next month brother said wedding date set july
nytimes,"At the Ambani Wedding Celebrations, a Dazzling Display of Jewels","June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/fashion/weddings/ambani-jewels.html,"When Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India abruptly changed her country’s constitution in 1971 and abolished the Privy Purse, a government allowance for the country’s former princely rulers, she also moved to nationalize their storied treasuries. Among the maharajahs, nizams and nabobs that once ruled the subcontinent, this set off a frenzy as they scurried to bury the family jewels. For centuries, the rarity, scale and grandeur of Indian jewels was so great that many became iconic objects. Take the Patiala Necklace, a tiered ornament resembling draperies of gems. Designed by Cartier, it featured an astounding 2,930 diamonds and centered on a single rock the size of a walnut. Or consider the Indore Pears, two stupendous and closely matched diamonds owned by Maharajah Yeshwant Rao Holkar II, a glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom was in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Indian princely patronage long set a global standard of splendor for both artistry and ostentation in the jewel trade. Yet in the decades after the Privy Purse, most of the big rocks seemed to have vanished underground. Legend has it that members of formerly royal families stashed their jewels in Swiss vaults, pawned them on the black market or hid them in flower pots. Bling on a royal scale largely disappeared. Or so it seemed until a fresh cadre of princes heaved into view: oligarchs. The richest of these by orders of magnitude is Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of his family’s megacompany Reliance Industries. Mr. Ambani’s personal fortune is estimated by Forbes at a staggering $115 billion. Despite his vast wealth, few outside India had heard of him — that is, until March 1, when he hosted a three-day party to celebrate his son Anant’s wedding in July. Everything about the prewedding affair was on a princely scale: the guest list of 1,000, including boldface names like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump; a glass palace specially constructed in the Ambani’s hometown, Jamnagar, in the western state of Gujarat; and Rihanna’s first public performance in years. Rihanna’s reported $6 million payday hogged the headlines, but what lit up at least one obsessive corner of the internet was the Ambani jewelry. This included necklaces and earrings and rings and hair ornaments of a size and grandeur seldom seen publicly since the days of the Raj. “It was almost like the time of maharajahs 100 years down the line,” said Pramod Kumar, an archivist and a founder of the museum consultancy EKA. He is also keeper of topophilia.india, an erudite Instagram account that is catnip for Indophile aesthetes. Mr. Kumar’s sleuth work traced a possible source of the two most gobsmacking gems seen at the Ambani prewedding celebration: massive step-cut Colombian emeralds roughly the size of Popsicles. Draped one below the other as pendants to a diamond necklace, they were worn one evening by the bridegroom’s mother, Nita Ambani. The bigger one was “of 562 carats,” Mr. Kumar wrote in an Instagram post, adding that the weight of the smaller stone was a mere 303 carats. Whatever their source, those emeralds were just two among many gems on display throughout an event at which the jewels often had greater star power than their wearers. “That emerald necklace was what caught everyone’s attention at first, but it was all almost unfathomable,” said Stellene Volandes, the editor in chief of Town & Country. She noted the scarcity represented by ropes of the rarest natural pearls from the Arabian Sea; necklaces in the heavy, ornate rani haar style studded with diamonds; and headpieces known as maang tikka, made with deep green emeralds from the storied Muzo mines. “You’d be very hard-pressed to find comparables for the sheer size and horsepower” of the jewels at the Ambani prewedding party, said Nico Landrigan, the president of the Verdura jewelry house in New York. “The Indians are a jewelry-obsessed culture in a category all their own. So you can only imagine what the actual wedding will bring out.” Before the wedding, scheduled for July 12 to 14 in Mumbai, there was yet another lavish preparatory celebration and opportunity to flaunt big rocks — a cruise from the Tyrrhenian Sea in Palermo, Italy, to the Mediterranean in Cannes, France, on an ocean liner whose 2,400 staterooms had been retrofitted for the Ambanis as three-bedroom suites for 800 invited guests. “Basically, what the Ambanis are doing is displaying a kind of old-style Hollywood glam,” said Mr. Kumar of EKA. “You don’t see that with any other current billionaire moguls in Europe or America, at least not in the public realm.” For Daniela Mascetti, the former chairwoman of Sotheby’s jewelry division in Europe and an author of “Understanding Jewelry,” a bible of the trade, the group more aptly compared to the Ambanis is the robber barons of the Industrial Age. “You have to look back to Vanderbilt or Gould, who also wanted big door-stoppers,” Ms. Mascetti said from London. “Let’s put it in a nice way,” she added. “If you are new money and you want to display wealth, you go big.” Yet it is not altogether that simple. Certain Ambani jewels were crafted using the whopper stones, but that is not to suggest that the determining factor in commissioning them was size. “There is tremendous artistry in the work,” said Ms. Volandes of Town & Country. Much of the Ambani jewels were designed by Viren Bhagat, among the more refined high jewelers, though also an assiduously private one. More than the size of individual stones like the stepped-cut emeralds, few save a detective like Mr. Kumar could predict their origins. “Being one-off is of the greatest importance in that world,” Francesca Amfitheatrof, the creative director of high jewelry and watches at Louis Vuitton, said recently from St.-Tropez, France, where she was debuting her latest collection. “To be able to source things that are so unique and outstanding, honestly, only an emperor has that possibility anymore,” she said. “It’s completely maharajah-like. It’s imperial.”",prime minister indira gandhi india abruptly changed country constitution abolished privy purse government allowance country former princely ruler also moved nationalize storied treasury among maharajah nizams nabob ruled subcontinent set frenzy scurried bury family jewel century rarity scale grandeur indian jewel great many became iconic object take patiala necklace tiered ornament resembling drapery gem designed cartier featured astounding diamond centered single rock size walnut consider indore pear two stupendous closely matched diamond owned maharajah yeshwant rao holkar ii glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom central indian state madhya pradesh indian princely patronage long set global standard splendor artistry ostentation jewel trade yet decade privy purse big rock seemed vanished underground legend member formerly royal family stashed jewel swiss vault pawned black market hid flower pot bling royal scale largely disappeared seemed fresh cadre prince heaved view oligarch richest order magnitude mukesh ambani chairman family megacompany reliance industry mr ambanis personal fortune estimated forbes staggering billion despite vast wealth outside india heard march hosted threeday party celebrate son anants wedding july everything prewedding affair princely scale guest list including boldface name like mark zuckerberg bill gate ivanka trump glass palace specially constructed ambanis hometown jamnagar western state gujarat rihannas first public performance year rihannas reported million payday hogged headline lit least one obsessive corner internet ambani jewelry included necklace earring ring hair ornament size grandeur seldom seen publicly since day raj almost like time maharajah year line said pramod kumar archivist founder museum consultancy eka also keeper topophiliaindia erudite instagram account catnip indophile aesthete mr kumars sleuth work traced possible source two gobsmacking gem seen ambani prewedding celebration massive stepcut colombian emerald roughly size popsicle draped one pendant diamond necklace worn one evening bridegroom mother nita ambani bigger one carat mr kumar wrote instagram post adding weight smaller stone mere carat whatever source emerald two among many gem display throughout event jewel often greater star power wearer emerald necklace caught everyones attention first almost unfathomable said stellene volandes editor chief town country noted scarcity represented rope rarest natural pearl arabian sea necklace heavy ornate rani haar style studded diamond headpiece known maang tikka made deep green emerald storied muzo mine youd hardpressed find comparables sheer size horsepower jewel ambani prewedding party said nico landrigan president verdura jewelry house new york indian jewelryobsessed culture category imagine actual wedding bring wedding scheduled july mumbai yet another lavish preparatory celebration opportunity flaunt big rock cruise tyrrhenian sea palermo italy mediterranean cannes france ocean liner whose stateroom retrofitted ambanis threebedroom suite invited guest basically ambanis displaying kind oldstyle hollywood glam said mr kumar eka dont see current billionaire mogul europe america least public realm daniela mascetti former chairwoman sothebys jewelry division europe author understanding jewelry bible trade group aptly compared ambanis robber baron industrial age look back vanderbilt gould also wanted big doorstopper m mascetti said london let put nice way added new money want display wealth go big yet altogether simple certain ambani jewel crafted using whopper stone suggest determining factor commissioning size tremendous artistry work said m volandes town country much ambani jewel designed viren bhagat among refined high jeweler though also assiduously private one size individual stone like steppedcut emerald save detective like mr kumar could predict origin oneoff greatest importance world francesca amfitheatrof creative director high jewelry watch louis vuitton said recently sttropez france debuting latest collection able source thing unique outstanding honestly emperor possibility anymore said completely maharajahlike imperial

nytimes,"Modi, Striking a Modest Tone, Is Sworn In for a Third Term","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/world/asia/india-changed-modi-swearing-in.html,"As a humbled Narendra Modi was sworn in on Sunday for a third term as India’s prime minister, the political air in New Delhi appeared transformed. The election that ended last week stripped Mr. Modi of his parliamentary majority and forced him to turn to a diverse set of coalition partners to stay in power. Now, these other parties are enjoying something that for years was singularly Mr. Modi’s: relevance and the spotlight. Their leaders have been swarmed by TV crews while on their way to present demands and policy opinions to Mr. Modi. His opponents, too, have been getting more airtime, with stations cutting live to their news conferences, something almost unheard-of in recent years. Above all, the change can be seen in Mr. Modi himself. For now, at least, the messianic air is gone. He pitches himself as the modest administrator that voters showed they wanted. “To run the government, a majority is necessary. But to run the nation, a consensus is necessary,” Mr. Modi said in a speech on Friday to members of his coalition ahead of his swearing in. “The people want us to deliver better than before.” A visibly emotional Mr. Modi took the oath of office on Sunday evening, only the second prime minister to be elected for a third consecutive term in the seven decades of India’s republic. The ceremony, at the country’s presidential palace, was attended by about 8,000 supporters and dignitaries, including the leaders of India’s neighboring nations. To many, Mr. Modi’s shift in approach can mean only good things for the country’s democracy — a move toward moderation in a hugely diverse nation that was being whipped into a Hindu-first monolith in the image of one man. The question is whether Mr. Modi can truly become something he has not been during his two-plus decades in elected office: a consensus builder. “He is a pragmatic politician and, for his own survival and for the survival of his party, he will be a little mellowed,” said Ashutosh, a New Delhi-based analyst who uses only one name and is the author of a book on how Indian politics have changed under Mr. Modi. “But to assume a qualitative change in his style of governance is expecting too much.” A trademark of Mr. Modi’s leadership in recent years has been the use of power levers at his disposal — from pressure of police cases to the lure of a share in power and its perks — to break his opponents and get them to switch to his side. A bruised governing party may well try such tactics to peel away some lawmakers to his side, analyst say, to buttress his place at the top. But in the days leading up to the swearing-in, a change in approach was evident. When members of the new coalition packed into the hall of India’s old Parliament building on Friday for deliberations on forming the government, every time a senior ally seated next to him stood up to start his speech, Mr. Modi also stood up. When it was time for Mr. Modi to be garlanded as the coalition’s choice for prime minister, he waited for the leaders of the two main coalition partners to arrive by his side before the congratulatory wreath of purple orchids was placed around his neck. His hourlong address contained none of his usual references to himself in the third person. His tone was measured. He focused on the coalition’s promise of “good governance” and “the dream of a developed India,” and he acknowledged that things would be different from the past 10 years. The last time Mr. Modi came to the Parliament complex for a closely watched event, last May when he inaugurated a new, more modern building for the assembly, he made an entrance some observers compared with that of a king: with markings on his forehead as a sign of piety and a scepter in his hand, as shirtless, chanting Hindu monks walked ahead of and behind him. This time, he went straight to a copy of the Constitution, which declares that India is a secular and socialist democracy, bowing before it and lifting it to his forehead. For the first time in his more than two decades in elected office, Mr. Modi finds himself in uncharted territory. Until now, as long as he has been at the helm — whether at the state level as the chief minister of Gujarat or at the national level — his Bharatiya Janata Party has always had a majority. Analysts say that history of never having been in the opposition has shaped his heavy-handed approach to politics. When he left Gujarat, after 13 years, he had established such a firm grip and had so routed the opposition that the state had effectively become one of single-party rule. His first national victory in 2014, with a majority for his B.J.P., ended decades of coalition governance in India, in which no party had been able to capture the 272 seats in Parliament necessary for a majority. In 2019, he was re-elected with an even bigger majority. Mr. Modi’s enormous power helped swiftly carry out what had for decades been his right-wing party’s agenda, including construction of a lavish Hindu temple on a long-disputed site that once held a mosque, and the revocation of the special status long enjoyed by the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir. A separatist insurgency has long troubled the Himalayan Kashmir region. As the inauguration ceremony began in New Delhi on Sunday, a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims in the Reasi district fell into a gorge after gunmen opened fire on it. At least eight people were killed, the police said. A trademark of Mr. Modi’s governance was a disregard for parliamentary procedures and for debates on legislation. His unexpected, overnight demonetization in 2016 — which invalidated India’s currency in an effort to crack down on corruption — threw the country into chaos and dealt a blow to a still cash-driven economy. Similarly, rushing to enact laws aimed at overhauling the agriculture market resulted in a year of protests that choked Delhi, forcing Mr. Modi to retreat. Before the election results came out, Mr. Modi’s party had predicted that his coalition would win 400 seats in India’s 543-seat Parliament. The opposition would be reduced to sitting “in the spectators’ gallery,” Mr. Modi said. Officials in his government had made clear that in his new term he would seek to put in place the only main item remaining on his party’s agenda: legislating a “uniform civil code” across this diverse country to replace varying laws of different religions that currently govern issues like marriage and inheritance. His party leaders spoke of Mr. Modi not only as their leader for the current term, but also for the next election in 2029, when he would be 78. “He has been trying to transform the country,” Sudesh Verma, a B.J.P. official who wrote a book on Mr. Modi’s rise, said in an interview before the election results were announced. “I look forward to him working like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, who worked into his 90s.” But under a coalition government, Mr. Modi’s traditional approach will be difficult. Two of the main coalition parties that helped him achieve the minimum number of Parliament seats to form a government are secular, in contrast to Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist ideology. N. Chandrababu Naidu, whose party holds 16 seats, has been scathing in the past in his criticism of Mr. Modi’s treatment of the Muslim minority. He has also openly criticized Mr. Modi for using the central investigating agencies to target his opponents and taking “steps to subvert all democratic institutions.” Neerja Chowdhury, a political analyst in Delhi and the author of the 2023 book “How Prime Ministers Decide,” said, “The contentious ideological issues, like the enactment of the uniform civil code, may be put on the back burner if the allies are not comfortable with it.” Mr. Modi’s popular image is built on two strong pillars. He is a champion of economic development, with an inspiring biography of a rise from a humble caste and relative poverty. He is also a lifelong Hindu nationalist, with decades as a foot soldier in a movement seeking to turn India’s secular and diverse state into an overtly Hindu-first place. At the peak of his power, the Hindu nationalist aspect increasingly dominated. Analysts say that the recent rebuke by voters might be a lucky break for the nation: prompting Mr. Modi to tap into his development champion side, and to focus on a legacy of economic transformation that could improve the lives of all Indians.",humbled narendra modi sworn sunday third term india prime minister political air new delhi appeared transformed election ended last week stripped mr modi

nytimes,"India’s Modi, Humbled by Voters, Faces Potent Economic Struggles","June 7, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/business/india-election-modi-economy.html,"Before the Indian election results emerged this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was widely viewed as a charismatic and popular strongman celebrated by the business world for elevating its importance, even as he failed to solve a vexing problem: how to turn swift economic growth into critically needed jobs. After the election, Mr. Modi finds himself staring at that same monumental puzzle, yet relegated to an uncomfortable new status. He is the head of a party that has been chastened at the polls, forcing him to forge a coalition to maintain power. Mr. Modi’s governing authority is likely to be constrained by the complexities of keeping his coalition partners on his side. He could not solve India’s most deep-seated economic challenge when he wielded a monopolistic hold on power. Now, he is a weakened leader who must balance additional interests, while still lacking an obvious way to improve living standards. “There has been a sense that employment growth has been weak in the last four, five years,” said Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic adviser to the Modi administration, who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “How do you create more jobs? This is really India’s central economic challenge, but I think the government will find itself with relatively limited tools.” The humbling of Mr. Modi’s party resonates in part as an expression of popular frustration that India remains a land of economic peril for hundreds of millions of people, as well as a country defined by astonishing contrasts in wealth. In major cities, five-star hotels boasting sumptuous spas look down on teeming slums that lack plumbing. In rural areas, malnutrition prevails under many roofs, and families struggle to find the money to keep children in school. Though its working-age population numbers roughly one billion, India has only 430 million jobs, according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, an independent research institution in Mumbai. And most of those counted as employed are stuck in precarious circumstances as day laborers and farm hands, lacking reliable wages and government workplace protections. Improved livelihoods are evident in many cities, from the high-rise apartments filling out the horizons to air-conditioned shopping malls and luxury cars choking roads. But the gains are narrowly concentrated. Professionals who work in technology centers in the south of the country and around the capital of New Delhi have enjoyed substantial progress. A rapidly growing domestic auto industry is a source of relatively high-paying jobs. Magnates like Gautam Adani, one of Asia’s richest men, have seen their business empires enhanced by their relationships with Mr. Modi and his willingness to eviscerate regulatory impediments to their greater fortune. But most Indian workers are effectively marooned in the so-called informal sector — laboring at roadside stalls, in small shops and in itinerant trades where they have no guarantee of income or the possibility of advancement. The failure of economic growth to yield more jobs is in large part the story of how India missed out on the manufacturing boom that played out in East Asia over recent decades. From South Korea and China to Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, hundreds of millions of people have escaped poverty via wages earned in factories. India has not shared in that transformation in large part because of a historical focus on self-sufficiency, a disdain for international trade and stultifying bureaucracy that has discouraged investment. “The whole manufacturing thing bypassed India,” Mr. Subramanian, the economist, said. “It’s that bigger development failure that is continuing to haunt India.” Mr. Modi has pursued initiatives aimed at bolstering manufacturing and increasing exports. His administration has streamlined regulations and improved ports. Yet despite some high-profile developments like Apple moving the assembly of some iPhones to India, manufacturing makes up only 13 percent of the country’s economy, according to World Bank data. That is a lower share than a decade ago, when Mr. Modi took office. Foreign money has flowed into India’s stock markets, multiplying share prices, a key element of Mr. Modi’s pro-business image. But persuading international investors to put money directly into Indian companies — a riskier bet — has been a harder sell. His Hindu nationalist party has demonized the Muslim minority, a source of social ferment that has raised fears of instability. The election could further discourage additional investment, because Mr. Modi will likely have a more difficult time gaining passage of stalled reforms sought by business, including laws making it easier to amass land and hire and fire workers. With no clear pathway toward economic dynamism and more challenging political circumstances, Mr. Modi might resort to a time-honored method of shoring up support: He will expand social welfare programs, tapping government coffers to hand out more cash to communities in need. Such a course could potentially diminish available funding for the advancement of the government’s signature program — its aggressive construction of highways, ports, airports and other infrastructure. Those plans are central to maintaining India’s strong economic growth and the broader campaign to encourage investment in manufacturing. Some fear that any short-term pursuit of political favor through the scattering of money could undermine the longer-term project of spurring jobs through the promotion of industry. “You need to ensure that the benefits of economic development reach the maximum number of people,” said Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at Global Data.TS Lombard, a forecasting and consulting firm in London. “If people keep depending on welfare and are not getting the benefits of economic development, then it basically just creates stagnation.” Geopolitical alterations appear to give India a fresh crack at growing its manufacturing base. As the United States and China engage in trade hostilities, multinational brands are seeking to reduce their heavy dependence on Chinese factories to make their goods. Major retailers like Walmart are increasingly looking to India as an alternative to China. But capturing that potential investment demands continued upgrading of highways, rail connections and ports, along with a focus on vocational training to give people the needed skills to take up factory work. Even before the election, there were doubts that Mr. Modi’s administration was moving quickly enough to realize these gains. “India is a counterweight to China in terms of geopolitics, and we will continue to see some of that investment flowing,” Ms. Deveshwar said. “But the scale at which they are provisioning the ecosystem for these opportunities just is not large enough.”",indian election

nytimes,The World Heads to the Polls,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/climate/global-elections-climate-change-policy.html,"One of the busiest election cycles in history is coming to an end on Sunday. Hundreds of millions of people have gone to the polls in South Africa, India and Mexico in recent days, and millions more will do the same in the European Union this weekend. As Somini Sengupta has explained in a series of articles this week, among the issues that the new leaders of these countries will face: how to transition away from coal, how to adapt to record-breaking heat and, in Europe’s case, how to address a growing backlash against environmental policies. Today, I want to lay out some the most pressing environmental challenges in these areas, and what the results announced in the past few days point to. Keep in mind that whatever happens in the United States election in November will affect many of these countries, too. The biggest takeaway from India’s elections, as my colleagues who cover the country put it, is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “lost his aura of invincibility.” His Bharatiya Janata Party still won far more seats than any other party, and Modi is set to take up his third consecutive term as prime minister. But his party didn’t win an outright majority and now needs coalition partners to stay in power. Many critics of the current government see the result as good news for democracy, because Modi will be forced to seek support from more moderate allies. It could also bring some relief to activists like Ritwick Dutta, an environmental lawyer whose efforts to defend nature in India have made him a target of the government. But it’s unclear how fewer seats in Parliament will affect Modi’s environmental policies. The main challenges facing the next Indian government are what to do about the effects of climate change, including heat waves that have killed dozens of people. During the elections, at least 33 poll workers were among them, and the heat also closed schools in several states,",one busiest election cycle history coming end sunday hundred million people gone poll south africa india mexico recent day million european union weekend somini sengupta explained series article week among issue new leader country face transition away coal adapt recordbreaking heat europe case address growing backlash environmental policy today want lay pressing environmental challenge area result announced past day point keep mind whatever happens united state election november affect many country biggest takeaway india election colleague cover country put prime minister narendra modi lost aura invincibility bharatiya janata party still far seat party modi set take third consecutive term prime minister party didnt win outright majority need coalition partner stay power many critic current government see result good news democracy modi forced seek support moderate ally could also bring relief activist like ritwick dutta environmental lawyer whose effort defend nature india made target government unclear fewer seat parliament affect modis environmental policy main challenge facing next indian government effect climate change including heat wave killed dozen people election least poll worker among heat also closed school several state
nytimes,Narendra Modi’s India,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/briefing/modis-india.html,"Narendra Modi has just won re-election as India’s prime minister, though by a far narrower margin than expected. With his third consecutive term, the charismatic strongman has still sealed his position as the country’s most significant leader in generations. Despite having led India for a decade, Modi has in some ways kept his country guessing about his vision. On major issues — India’s relationships, its economy, its society and its government — it’s still unclear what sort of country Modi wants India to be. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain four of the big questions. India has spent recent years deepening its relationship with the United States. It has gotten closer to American allies, including Japan and Australia, and ordered high-end American weapons systems — the kind that create dependence down the road. And it is unlikely to side with China. In 2020, Chinese troops crossed into territory controlled by India and killed 20 soldiers in a skirmish. Modi has kept Beijing at arm’s length since then. But Modi, 73, has signaled that he doesn’t want to be a U.S. ally. Some officials in his inner circle still regard the United States warily. American diplomats complain about New Delhi’s apparent efforts to erode democratic norms and the rights of minority groups. So India keeps its options open. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States tried in vain to persuade India to take a stand against the war. India still processes Russian oil (picking up the slack created by international sanctions). It still buys weapons from Russia. India spent the Cold War trying to position itself as a nonaligned power. Old habits die hard. India recently overtook China as the most populous country and the fastest-growing large economy. Still, most of the country remains poor. Some 800 million people need help filling their stomachs.

nytimes,"In Global Elections, Strongmen Are Taken Down a Notch","June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/world/global-elections-india-turkey-democracy.html,"In India, a powerful leader wins another term but sees his party’s majority vanish. In South Africa, the governing party is humbled by voters for the first time since the end of apartheid. In Britain, a populist insurgent barges into an election that is shaping up to be a crushing defeat for the long-ruling Conservatives. If there is a common thread halfway through this global year of elections, it is a desire by voters to send a strong signal to the powers that be — if not quite a wholesale housecleaning, then a defiant shake-up of the status quo. Even in Mexico, where Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and the handpicked successor of the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was elected in a landslide last Sunday, voters were rewarding the forces that had uprooted the country’s entrenched establishment only six years earlier. With a billion-plus people going to the polls in more than 60 countries, some analysts had feared that 2024 would pose a fateful test for democracy — one that it might fail. For years, populist and strongmen leaders have chipped away at democratic institutions, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of elections, while social media has swamped voters with disinformation and conspiracy theories. In some of the biggest, most fragile democracies, leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey had been regarded as close to invincible, using appeals to nationalism or sectarianism to mobilize supporters and bending institutions to suit their purposes. Yet now, Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan have both had their wings clipped. Soaring inflation, chronic unemployment and uneven economic growth have widened inequality in India, Turkey and elsewhere, frustrating voters who have shown a willingness to buck the establishment. “We do have electoral systems that are producing outcomes the governing parties didn’t want,” said Ben Ansell, a professor of comparative democratic institutions at the University of Oxford. “They’ve all been destabilized by a tricky economic environment, and behaving like strongmen hasn’t saved them.” Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan remain in power, each now in his third term. But Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., lost dozens of seats and will have to govern in a coalition with two secular parties. Turkey’s opposition struck a blow against Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party in April, winning a string of local elections and solidifying its control of important cities like Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. “In a lot of countries where there’s been talk of backsliding, that’s where we’ve seen a bounce back,” Professor Ansell said. “For Modi and Erdogan, taking the sheen off their infallibility was very important.” With so many elections in so many countries, it is dangerous to generalize. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia rolled up 88 percent of the vote in a landslide re-election victory in March that spoke less to Russian public sentiment and more to the ability of an autocrat, facing no meaningful opposition, to stage-manage a show of support for his war in Ukraine. In Europe, far-right parties are expected to perform well in European Parliament elections, which began on Thursday. Analysts said they did not believe this would jeopardize the political center that has governed Europe in the post-World War II era. And Poland provided a source of reassurance last fall, when voters pushed out its nationalist Law and Justice Party in favor of a more liberal opposition. Still, the success of far-right figures like Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy, attests to the enduring appeal of populism. “Populists and right-wingers will continue to make gains and strike fear into the European political establishment,” the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said in its analysis of the top risks of 2024. Britain’s general election was shaken up on Monday when Nigel Farage, a populist politician, pro-Brexit campaigner and ally of former President Donald J. Trump, announced he would run for a seat in Parliament under the banner of his Reform U.K. party, which has a strident anti-immigration message. That will add to the headache for the Conservative Party, which has lagged the opposition Labour Party by double digits in polls for nearly 18 months. Reform, which is fielding candidates across the country, could siphon off Conservative votes among those who blame the party for a weak economy and rising immigration numbers since Britain left the European Union in 2020. Some critics argue that the Conservative Party’s problems stem from its free-market policies, which they say have disillusioned voters in disadvantaged parts of Britain and set it apart from right-wing parties in Europe or Mr. Trump’s Make America Great Again movement in the United States. More fundamentally, though, the Conservatives have been in power for 14 years, and they face the same pent-up dissatisfaction with the status quo that fueled the recent elections in India, South Africa and Turkey. In some countries, the urge to break with the past has led voters to make unorthodox choices: Javier Milei, a flamboyant libertarian economist, swept to power in Argentina last November with a promise to close its central bank and wage an all-out assault on what he described as a corrupt political “caste.” Some analysts argue that similarly disruptive forces are driving the presidential race in the United States, where a comparatively healthy economy and the advantages of incumbency have not spared President Biden, who faces a neck-and-neck challenge from Mr. Trump even after the former president was convicted of multiple felonies. “It’s not about left versus right, it’s about the status quo versus change,” said Frank Luntz, an American political strategist who has lived and worked in Britain. “You can’t buy a house in the U.K., the N.H.S. doesn’t work,” he said, referring to the National Health Service. “In the United States, you can’t afford housing or health care. It’s about broken promises, year after year after year.” That sense of betrayal is even more acute in countries like South Africa, where the African National Congress, or A.N.C., has governed since the start of democracy there in 1994, piling up majorities even as the economy and social infrastructure crumbled. Last week, voters finally rebelled, driving down the A.N.C.’s vote share to 40 percent, from 58 percent in the last national election in 2019. Among their biggest complaints is the lack of job opportunities: South Africa’s unemployment rate — at 42 percent, including those who have stopped looking for work — is one of the highest in the world. Stagnation has widened the country’s already profound inequality. South Africans flock to cities looking for work. But many end up in decrepit buildings and slapdash shack communities, often without running water or sanitary toilets. Regular power outages leave streets dark and residents of many communities vulnerable to crime. South Africa’s murder rate is six and a half times as high as that of the United States and 45 times as high as Germany’s. Jacob Zuma, the scandal-scarred former president, has benefited from this misery, helping start a new party, umKhonto weSizwe, or M.K., which won nearly 15 percent of the vote, mostly at the expense of his former party, the A.N.C. Mr. Zuma attracts a feverish following among disillusioned A.N.C. supporters, who accuse the party of selling out to wealthy white businesspeople and not moving aggressively enough to redistribute wealth to the Black majority after apartheid. India’s election was a comparable anti-incumbent revolt, even if Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. is still the largest party in Parliament by a wide margin. The party’s campaign spending was at least 20 times as much as that of its main opposition, the Congress Party, which had its bank accounts frozen by the government in a tax dispute on the eve of the election. The country’s news outlets have been largely bought off or bullied into silence. And yet, the results showed Mr. Modi, 73, losing his majority for the first time since he took office in 2014. Analysts said that reflected widespread dissatisfaction with how the fruits of India’s economy have been shared. While India’s steady growth has made it the envy of its neighbors — and created a conspicuous billionaire class — those riches have not flowed to the hundreds of millions of India’s poor. The government has handed out free rations of wheat, grain and cooking gas. It offers home water connections, subsidizes building supplies and gives farmers cash. But it has not tackled India’s inflation or unemployment, leaving hundreds of millions of people, especially women, chronically out of work. There is also some evidence that Mr. Modi’s appeals to Hindu nationalism were not as potent as in previous elections. The B.J.P.’s candidate did not even win the constituency that is home to the lavish Ram temple, built on grounds disputed by Hindus and Muslims. Mr. Modi inaugurated the temple just before the campaign started, hoping it would galvanize his Hindu political base. The economy figured into Mexico’s election as well, but in a very different way. While overall growth was disappointing — averaging only 1 percent a year during Mr. López Obrador’s term — the government doubled the minimum wage and strengthened the peso, lifting millions of Mexicans out of poverty. “People vote with their wallets, and it’s very obvious there’s more money in the wallets of almost everybody in Mexico,” said Diego Casteñeda Garza, a Mexican economist and historian at Uppsala University in Sweden. Still, analysts said, there was also a desire among voters to cement the change that Mr. López Obrador, a charismatic outsider, symbolized when he came to power in 2018. Even as Ms. Sheinbaum, 61, vowed to continue her mentor’s policies, she cast herself — Mexico’s first female and Jewish president — as a change agent. For Jacqueline González, 33, who works at a cargo transportation company and viewed Mexico’s previous governments as corrupt, that made voting for Ms. Sheinbaum an easy decision. “With Obrador we have already seen, although some people don’t want to admit it, some change,” Ms. González said. “Let’s hope it continues with Sheinbaum.”",india powerful leader win another term see party majority vanish

nytimes,"Rahul Gandhi, Long on the Ropes, Looks Set for an Unexpected Comeback","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-congress-rahul-gandhi.html,"Just last year, Rahul Gandhi and the once-powerful party he led, the Indian National Congress, seemed to be on the ropes and little threat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s consolidation of political power. Congress had not been a competitive factor in national elections in years, winning fewer and fewer votes each time Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party was elected. And Mr. Gandhi himself had been convicted on a slander charge and barred from holding a seat in Parliament. But on Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi and a broad opposition coalition led by his Congress party registered a far stronger showing than expected in India’s elections, setting the stage for an unlikely comeback. “He has finally arrived,” said Rasheed Kidwai, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi. “This time he has improved his vote share by at least 17 million votes, which is very substantial.” On Wednesday, Mr. Modi’s party announced that it had reached an agreement to form a governing coalition, including two parties that do not necessarily share its vision. Congress won 99 seats in the 543-seat Parliament, a gain of 47 seats, and the alliance of which it is the leading part won a total of 232. Congress and its alliance of over two dozen political groups have presented the results as a “moral victory” over a B.J.P. government that they say was trying to change the country’s Constitution and have portrayed as anathema to India’s identity as a multifaith and secular country. “The fight was to save the Constitution,” Mr. Gandhi, the son, grandson and great-grandson of Congress prime ministers, said as the results poured in. The first major sign that Congress might be able to contend came in May 2023, just a couple of months after Mr. Gandhi’s conviction for slander, when his party won the state government of Karnataka, in the south of India, from the B.J.P. The lift was temporary; Congress soon lost power in three states it governed to the B.J.P. But at the same time, political experts say, Mr. Gandhi was pushing for changes within the party, India’s oldest, which had long resisted overhauling an archaic organizational structure that kept its top leaders isolated from the grass-roots workers who deliver votes. Feelings that Congress’s leaders were corrupt and out of touch resulted in a string of defeats over a number of years and then degenerated into messy infighting within the party. For the past two years, party members say, Mr. Gandhi has tried to reverse the decline of Congress by surrounding himself with young policy analysts to help him understand the challenges facing India, as well as party veterans with their ears to the ground in towns and villages that Congress was targeting. The party has in addition improved its social media game, trumpeting its messages on platforms like WhatsApp and YouTube. Mr. Gandhi also raised his profile by embarking on two walks across India — meeting farmers in their fields and vegetable sellers on city streets; and drinking tea with recent graduates and gig workers — in an effort to show common cause with ordinary people. Perhaps most important, Congress focused on a strategy of reaching out to and cooperating with key regional players across the country whose influence had dimmed under B.J.P. rule. Congress leaders made a series of “seat-sharing” agreements with regional leaders, big and small, that strengthened the alliance against Mr. Modi’s party. To avoid splitting the anti-B.J.P. vote, Congress had its own candidates contest fewer seats. And Mr. Gandhi campaigned vigorously alongside the leaders of like-minded political groups across India. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Gandhi also won support, party leaders say, by characterizing Mr. Modi as a leader who would destroy India’s secular character. “It is a victory not just for him and our alliance partners but for the millions of poor Indians who voted to protect the secular fabric of this country,” said Srinivas B.V., another Congress leader, about Mr. Gandhi. “People showed Modi: ‘You are not God, and you can be replaced.’” Since being voted to power in 2014, Mr. Modi has sought to position Hinduism, the religion of some 80 percent of Indians, at the center of the country’s official identity. He also promised to end corruption, overhaul the economy and help India become a “developed nation” by 2047. But after his re-election in 2019, he leaned into Hindu themes to a greater extent. Mr. Gandhi’s efforts to contrast his vision for India with Mr. Modi’s largely paid off, analysts say, even if some members of his party jumped ship and sided with the B.J.P. Many of the politicians who defected from Congress to the B.J.P. lost their seats, including in West Bengal and Maharashtra, where Congress and its partners did especially well. Throughout the campaign Mr. Gandhi persistently linked Mr. Modi with Gautam Adani, Asia’s richest man, saying the prime minister was working for his tycoon friends, not for the vast majority of Indians who are poor. As if to vindicate this line of attack, over the two days after the election results were announced, the price of Mr. Adani’s flagship stock fell by 14 percent. (It then recovered somewhat on Wednesday.) “People directly correlate Adani Ji with Modi Ji — directly,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters after the results, using Hindi honorifics for the two men. Researchers who traveled across India during the voting said Mr. Gandhi had beaten Mr. Modi on his own turf in many places by focusing on issues like the millions of Indians without jobs and the economic difficulties faced by farmers. He also accused the B.J.P. of governance failures and worked with local political groups fighting for social justice and for the empowerment of lower-caste Indians. Uttar Pradesh, where Mr. Modi made dozens of visits to campaign for local candidates, is one state where the changing fortunes of the two largest political groupings was evident. The state is India’s largest, and accounts for 80 of the Parliament’s 543 seats. The B.J.P. recorded its worst performance there since 2009, in part because Mr. Gandhi was able to craft an alliance with a powerful local leader, Akhilesh Yadav. In addition to the 37 seats picked up by Mr. Yadav’s Samajwadi Party, Congress won six, helped by aggressive campaigning by Mr. Gandhi’s sister, Priyanka Vadra, who helped defeat a former soap-opera actress who had served as a minister in Mr. Modi’s government. The B.J.P. won 33 seats, down from 62 in the previous Parliament. The election results announced on Wednesday have given a major lift to hundreds of thousands of Congress workers across the country, who were growing tired of the internal infighting that has plagued their party for years. Outside Congress headquarters in New Delhi, Bansi Lal Meena, a veteran Congress member from the state of Rajasthan, was exultant about his party’s performance. “In villages and on the ground, the B.J.P. spread lies for years against us — saying that we are anti-Hindu,” he said. “They used my religion as a weapon against me to win votes.” He added: “We will show them now because our people are also in Parliament.”",last year rahul gandhi oncepowerful party led indian national congress seemed rope little threat prime minister narendra modis consolidation political power congress competitive

nytimes,Narendra Modi Fell to Earth After Making It All About Himself,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-election-modi.html,"When everything became about Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, his party and its century-old Hindu-nationalist network were propelled to unimagined heights. On the back of his singular charisma and political skill, a onetime-fringe religious ideology was pulled to the center of Indian life. Landslide election victories remade India’s politics, once dominated by diverse coalitions representing a nation that had shaped its independence on secular principles. But there were always risks in wrapping a party’s fortunes so completely in the image of one man, in inundating a country of many religions, castes and cultures with that leader’s name, face and voice. Voters could start to think that everything was about him, not them. They could even revolt. On Tuesday, Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., fell back to earth. After having promised their biggest election romp yet, they lost more than 60 seats. Mr. Modi will remain in office for a third term, but only with the help of a contentious coalition of parties, some of which are opposed to his core beliefs and want power of their own. With the result, India’s strained democracy appeared to roar back to life, its beaten-down political opposition reinvigorated. And after a decade in which Mr. Modi’s success in entrenching Hindu supremacy had often felt like the new common sense, India is seeing its leader and itself in a new light, and trying to understand this unexpected turn. Most fundamentally, the opposition, newly coalesced for what it called a do-or-die moment as Mr. Modi increasingly tilted the playing field, found a way to use the cult of personality around him to its advantage. Opposition leaders focused on bread-and-butter issues, often at granular levels in particular constituencies. They hammered Mr. Modi over persistent unemployment and stark inequality. But the B.J.P., with Mr. Modi from on high its only spokesman, was often left with just one answer: Trust in “Modi’s guarantee.” “The ‘Modi’s guarantee’ slogan turned out to be our undoing,” said Ajay Singh Gaur, a B.J.P. worker who had campaigned in the party stronghold of Uttar Pradesh, the northern state where Mr. Modi suffered his biggest blow on Tuesday, losing nearly half of the B.J.P. seats. “The opposition made that sound like this was not about him having delivered, or trying to deliver,” Mr. Gaur said, “but about him being an arrogant politician.” Mr. Modi gave his adversaries a lot to work with, even declaring that he may not be “biological” and that he had been sent by God. He has still emerged better so far than other Indian leaders who deeply centralized power. He remains in control of levers of power that could help him and his party restore their dominance. Indira Gandhi, who had also glorified herself and went so far as to suspend India’s democracy after declaring a national emergency, was voted out at the peak of her powers before returning three years later. But Mr. Modi’s B.J.P., the world’s largest political party, finds itself in a tough spot after years of centralization and reliance on a government machinery put to the service of one man, analysts say. The huge advantage the party has built in numbers and resources is undercut by a lack of internal consultation and delegation of authority. That was a key reason for its failure in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, with 240 million people, and surrounding states. Local B.J.P. leaders were disenchanted by a top-down approach toward choosing candidates, as well as what they called a misguided belief that Mr. Modi’s popularity could allow the party to sidestep potent local issues and caste factors. With Mr. Modi sucking up all the oxygen at the top, other senior leaders of the party have been left to fight for relevance and a voice. His relentless self-promotion has also alienated the leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., the B.J.P.’s right-wing fountainhead. During election seasons, the R.S.S. activates its vast grass-roots network in support of B.J.P. candidates. While Mr. Modi, a former foot soldier in the organization, has advanced many of its goals, his consolidation of power goes against its regimented nature and its focus on ideology over individual personalities. One R.S.S. insider, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking, said that Mr. Modi’s exalting of himself had created such resentment inside the group that some of its leaders welcomed any sort of reality check for him, short of his ouster. Sudheendra Kulkarni, a political analyst who served as an aide to the first B.J.P. prime minister in the 1990s, said Mr. Modi had pushed through unpopular legislation — in particular farm laws that prompted a yearlong protest that choked New Delhi — without consulting with party officials in the affected states. They were left to cope with the ramifications. “The B.J.P. was never a one-leader party,” Mr. Kulkarni said. “All that changed with Narendra Modi in 2014. He sought to promote a new authoritarian idea of one nation, one leader.” Hypothesizing that Mr. Modi’s popularity had peaked, the opposition saw an opening to go after a decisive section of votes in the Indian political formula. For decades before his rise in 2014, neither the B.J.P. nor the Indian National Congress, the country’s two largest parties, could muster majorities on its own. Mr. Modi expanded his party’s backing by consolidating right-wing Hindu voters and drawing in new supporters with his personal story of a humble caste and economic background and a promise to change lives through robust development. A decade later, in this year’s election, the opposition found traction in painting a very different picture of Mr. Modi — as an autocratic friend of billionaires. Since Mr. Modi had achieved everything he had set out to do, the opposition argued, his pursuit of a resounding majority could only mean that he would seek radical change to the Constitution. That claim stirred anxiety among India’s Dalits and other underprivileged groups, who see the Constitution as their only protection in a deeply unequal society, guaranteeing them a share of government jobs and seats in higher education as well as elected bodies. The opposition was able to push the message harder when some in Mr. Modi’s right-wing support base, long seen as having an upper-caste bias, called for revoking the quotas. Caste identity was a major driving factor for voters in many states, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, with its 80 parliamentary seats. The decline of a Dalit party in the state meant that about 20 percent of the votes were potentially up for grabs. In Ayodhya, the constituency where Mr. Modi inaugurated a grand Ram temple earlier this year in an effort to consolidate his Hindu support base, the opposition put up a Dalit candidate. He handily defeated the B.J.P.’s two-term incumbent. In other cases, voters showed their anger over the B.J.P.’s perceived sense of impunity. In Kheri, a constituency where the son of a B.J.P. minister rammed his S.U.V. into a crowd of protesting farmers, killing several, the minister also lost. Mr. Modi’s election campaign took its most divisive turn in Banswara, in the desert state of Rajasthan, where he called India’s 200 million Muslims “infiltrators” and raised fears that the opposition would give them India’s wealth, including Hindu women’s necklaces. Banswara’s B.J.P. incumbent was routed in the election. While the loss was most likely attributable to local issues, the national discussion noted that Mr. Modi’s comments had not helped. In his own constituency of Varanasi, in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Modi’s winning margin of nearly half a million votes in 2019 shrank to about 150,000 — a disappointing showing after he had dispatched some of the B.J.P.’s most senior leaders to camp out there to help him achieve an even bigger victory. Jai Prakash, a tea and samosa seller in Varanasi, said some of the prime minister’s work, particularly his improvement of roads, was popular. But Mr. Modi was losing the plot, Mr. Prakash said, by turning to issues disconnected from people’s day-to-day lives. “Prices are skyrocketing; so is unemployment,” Mr. Prakash said. “He has done some good. But people cannot worship him endlessly.”",everything became prime minister narendra modi india party centuryold hindunationalist network propelled unimagined height back singular charisma political

nytimes,"India Keeps Its Glorious, Messy Tradition Alive","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/opinion/india-election-modi-bjp-democracy.html,"Back in January, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India looked all but unstoppable, he visited the small city of Ayodhya for the unofficial start of his campaign to win a third term. The location was freighted with symbolism. For decades, Hindu nationalists had sought to build a temple in Ayodhya, at a spot they believe to be the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. The only problem was that there was already a house of worship on the spot, a mosque built by a Mughal emperor in 1528. A Hindu mob had dismantled the mosque in 1992, setting off riots that killed 2,000 people, most of them Muslims. The ruins were a flashpoint of religious tensions in India for decades. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party promised to build the temple, and the lavish event at which Modi officially opened it was a showcase for that achievement. At the time it seemed like strong election-year messaging for a politician who built his career on the twin planks of Hindu nationalism and building a muscular new India. Unlike other politicians, the event implied, Modi made promises and kept them. “It is the beginning of a new era,” he declared. Feeling supremely confident, Modi had boldly asked the Indian electorate for something akin to a blank check to remake the country — control of 400 seats in Parliament in elections that began in April and concluded on June 1. And why shouldn’t he have been confident? India’s economy was the fastest-growing in the world. India had overtaken China as the world’s most-populous country. World leaders sought Modi’s support on issues ranging from the war in Ukraine to the climate crisis, cementing India’s ascent in global affairs. But the ever unpredictable electorate of the world’s largest democracy responded to Modi’s demand for still more power resolutely: No thanks. In a stunning rebuke, election results released on Tuesday showed that India’s voters have reduced the parliamentary share of Modi’s party by more than 60 seats, not enough for an outright majority, never mind the supermajority he had sought. It struck me as particularly apt that despite all the fanfare about the glorious new temple in Ayodhya, Modi’s party lost the city’s parliamentary seat to a political opposition that had been all but left for dead. There appears to be a clear ceiling to the appeals to Hindu identity on its own. “We are very happy with the temple, but people were fed up with the B.J.P.,” a local business leader, Rakesh Yadav, told Reuters. “People will not always fall for the caste or temple-mosque politics. They also want to see development.” This is a big year for democracy, almost a referendum of sorts on the very idea. Dozens of countries are holding elections, representing roughly half of the world’s population. But authoritarianism has been on the march. The latest report from Freedom House found that by many measures, global freedom has declined for the 18th straight year. India, despite its status as the world’s most-populous democracy, has been a poster child for this decline under Modi: His government has taken aim at just about every form of freedom. He has attacked and grievously weakened the independence of India’s once boisterous press. He has jailed critics and political opponents. He has sharpened religious animosity, referring during this campaign to Muslims, who make up 14 percent of India’s population, as “infiltrators” who seek to steal wealth and power from the Hindu majority. It’s an Indian edition of the nationalist, populist playbook playing out around the world. That a newly unified opposition managed to prevent Modi’s party from winning an outright majority under these conditions took everyone, including me, by surprise. And it suggests that even when would-be authoritarians attempt to tilt the playing field, voters can and will state their will, no matter the autocrat’s preferences. “The B.J.P. had positioned itself as a new hegemonic power,” Yamini Aiyar, a scholar and analyst of Indian democracy who has been a frequent target of Hindu nationalist rage, told me. “The beauty of an election is that politicians have to go to the people, and the people get an opportunity to express their anxieties and their perspectives.” Express them they did. Looking back, the weakness of the B.J.P.’s re-election case is clear: Yes, India’s economy was growing fast. But despite the flashy new infrastructure projects and deals to increase high-tech manufacturing, the growth was not creating nearly enough jobs, and inflation remained stubbornly high, especially for food, which hits the poorest hardest. Much of the wealth generated by growth has gone to India’s richest tycoons, and inequality has soared. “The reality is that the real economy has been hurting for a very long time, and they have systematically sought to ignore it,” Aiyar said. India has managed to lift millions of people out of poverty since Modi came to power 10 years ago, but particularly in rural areas, where most Indians live, that has meant social welfare rather than jobs. There were other issues too — Modi’s allies had floated the idea of changing India’s Constitution in various ways, including removing its commitment to secularism and enshrining Hinduism as the national faith. These kinds of appeals have helped the B.J.P. in the past but seem to have had less power this time around. One clear sign was its heavy losses in Uttar Pradesh, which is not just India’s most populous state; it is also part of the heavily Hindu heartland of northern India. It also seems that the opposition may finally have gotten its act together. India’s main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, has been in decline for years and had struggled to make common cause with other opposition parties in previous elections. But this year the opposition parties managed to make a much stronger coalition. They focused on kitchen table issues and highlighted the Modi government’s ties to big business and high-flying billionaires. The opposition didn’t shy away from making the stakes for Indian democracy clear. But the relentless focus on what voters said mattered most offers lessons for those battling revanchist movements elsewhere, including in the United States. Sometimes you need to meet voters where they are. This vote wasn’t a total rebuke of Modi and his policies. He is all but certain to get his third term as prime minister by making a coalition with allied parties. But it is a clear and salutary check on his authoritarian project. This election is also a rebuke of Indian elites — in business and media especially — who had willingly surrendered to a kind of inevitability of Modi’s long-term consolidation of power, making peace with it or even celebrating it. Activists, analysts and journalists who had the temerity to speak plainly about Modi’s revanchist project and the threat he posed to the world’s biggest democracy and its long history of tolerance, secularism and free speech have been hounded out of public life. I hope that this troubling slide ends now. As the results rolled in on Tuesday, I remembered my own reporting trip to Ayodhya in 2009, when I was a correspondent for The Times based in India. An explosive new government report had just been issued about the destruction of the mosque and the role of Hindu nationalist groups in stirring up violence. But when I got there, I was surprised to find that on the hotly contested spot itself there was hardly any hoopla. The crowds of Hindu nationalist volunteers who for years had routinely shown up to build the temple with their bare hands had disappeared. India was going through a period of hopeful prosperity. Voters had just returned the Indian National Congress party and its allies to power with a larger majority, and a brilliant, teetotaling economist named Manmohan Singh was prime minister. With the future looking so alluring, no one seemed all that interested in litigating the past. These hopes were ultimately dashed amid scandals over political corruption and mismanagement. The Congress party, which once seemed unstoppable, lost power in 2014 for failing to deliver on its promise to bring India to its long-awaited place among the world’s richest and most powerful nations. The years ahead will, with any luck, be ones of negotiation and compromise. This will be a return to form for India, a vastly diverse nation whose unruly polity has resisted autocracy at every turn since it shrugged off British colonial rule in 1947. The whole world should breathe a sigh of relief that India’s voters have spoken, loudly, in favor of continuing that glorious, messy tradition.",back january prime minister narendra modi india looked

nytimes,The New Kingmakers Who Could Make or Break Modi’s Government,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-elections-modi-coalition.html,"After his first two national election victories, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India easily set his own terms, with his Bharatiya Janata Party winning clear majorities. The result was different in this vote. It was still a victory, but one that left him dependent on a host of coalition partners — particularly on politicians from two regional parties who could make or break Mr. Modi’s ability to form a government. Of the more than a dozen parties that make up the B.J.P.’s coalition, known as the National Democratic Alliance, most won just one or two seats, leaving the party in a difficult predicament. On Wednesday, the B.J.P. said it had reached an agreement to form a coalition government that includes those two regional parties — the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United. They will be the biggest junior partners, but they are also avowedly secular and removed from Mr. Modi’s Hindu-nationalist ideology. Cameras on Wednesday followed every word, meeting and movement of the leaders of the two parties, N. Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party, and Nitish Kumar of Janata Dal-United. Their combined 28 seats in Parliament will give the prime minister the votes he needs to stay in power and push through his agenda. Here is what to know about the men who unexpectedly found themselves as kingmakers, and about the parties they lead. Though some of the members of the B.J.P.’s coalition this year share Mr. Modi’s hard-line vision, both the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United are moderate, secular parties that have a diverse support base. Speculation in India was focusing on what terms the men were demanding for their support, which are unlikely to be rooted in ideology. Both Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar are known to be pragmatic, deal-making politicians whose priorities will be practical concessions for their state, or perhaps cabinet positions. Mr. Kumar has earned a reputation in India for his willingness to switch allegiances over the past decade. He has gone between aligning himself with the B.J.P.-led coalition to supporting its rivals no fewer than five times. Most recently, in January, he returned to Mr. Modi’s alliance just 18 months after he’d left it and with just months to go until the election. He has said his switching of political loyalties was in the interest of his state, Bihar. Mr. Naidu has also at times broken with Mr. Modi, cutting ties with the B.J.P. in 2018 and joining forces with its chief rival, Indian National Congress, ahead of the 2019 elections. He has said that his party has aligned with the B.J.P. out of “political compulsion.” Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar have both been in politics for decades, and have been mentioned as potential candidates for prime minister. Mr. Naidu of the T.D.P., based in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, is a technocrat who has aggressively pushed for investment from information technology companies in his region. His policies helped bring high-paying jobs for I.T. professionals and transformed the city of Hyderabad. Mr. Kumar is a nine-time chief minister of Bihar, India’s poorest state, who comes from a homegrown socialist background. He has pushed for more funds for low-caste Hindus, and his alliance with the B.J.P. broadened support for the party in his state.",first two national election victory prime minister narendra modi india easily set term bharatiya janata party winning clear majority result different vote still victory one left dependent host coalition partner particularly politician two regional party could make break mr modis ability form government dozen party make bjps coalition known national democratic alliance one two seat leaving party difficult predicament wednesday bjp said reached agreement form coalition government includes two regional party telugu desam party janata dalunited biggest junior partner also avowedly secular removed mr modis hindunationalist ideology camera wednesday followed every word meeting movement leader two party n chandrababu naidu telugu desam party nitish kumar janata dalunited combined seat parliament give prime minister vote need stay power push agenda know men unexpectedly found kingmaker party lead though member bjps coalition year share mr modis hardline vision telugu desam party janata dalunited moderate secular party diverse support base speculation india focusing term men demanding support unlikely rooted ideology mr naidu mr kumar known pragmatic dealmaking politician whose priority practical concession state perhaps cabinet position mr kumar earned reputation india willingness switch allegiance past decade gone aligning bjpled coalition supporting rival fewer five time recently january returned mr modis alliance month hed left month go election said switching political loyalty interest state bihar mr naidu also time broken mr modi cutting tie bjp joining force chief rival indian national congress ahead election said party aligned bjp political compulsion mr naidu mr kumar politics decade mentioned potential candidate prime minister mr naidu tdp based southern state andhra pradesh technocrat aggressively pushed investment information technology company region policy helped bring highpaying job professional transformed city hyderabad mr kumar ninetime chief minister bihar india poorest state come homegrown socialist background pushed fund lowcaste hindu alliance bjp broadened support party state
nytimes,"Modi se reelige en India, pero pierde mayoría parlamentaria: 4 claves de las elecciones","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/06/05/espanol/elecciones-india-modi.html,"[Estamos en WhatsApp. Empieza a seguirnos ahora] La primera década de Narendra Modi como primer ministro de India ha estado plagada de sorpresas. Ninguna, sin embargo, se comparó con lo que ocurrió el martes por la mañana, cuando Modi ganó su segunda reelección, pero su partido perdió la mayoría en el Parlamento. Con esa derrota, el aire de invencibilidad de Modi también pareció desvanecerse por primera vez desde que asumió el cargo en 2014. Los resultados de las elecciones fueron particularmente interesantes porque, tras casi siete semanas de votaciones en todo el país, las encuestas a pie de urna publicadas pocos días antes del recuento final mostraban que el Partido Popular Indio de Modi ganaría de forma aplastante, como ya había hecho en dos ocasiones anteriores. Sin embargo, el Partido Popular Indio solo obtuvo 239 escaños, muy por debajo de los 272 necesarios para formar gobierno. La alianza de la oposición, liderada por el Partido del Congreso Nacional Indio, obtuvo 235 escaños. Con los 52 escaños obtenidos por los aliados del Partido Popular Indio, Modi seguirá a la cabeza. Pero su atractivo ha disminuido y su liderazgo ha cambiado radicalmente. Cuando Modi llegó al poder en 2014, prometió progreso económico, el fin de la corrupción y la promoción del hinduismo como elemento central de la identidad india. Con todo ello, se presentó como un líder singularmente fuerte, capaz de reunir a sus seguidores para trabajar por la nación. Esto contrastaba con el gobierno anterior. Antes de que Modi fuera elegido por primera vez, India llevaba 25 años gobernada por coaliciones. Los primeros ministros del Partido del Congreso, del Partido Popular Indio y de terceros partidos más pequeños se alternaban para dirigir India por comités. Modi rompió con esa tradición y lideró un nuevo sistema de partido único dominado por el Partido Popular Indio. Como líder, Modi mostró poco interés en compartir el poder. Cuando invalidó la mayor parte del papel moneda de India en 2016, ni siquiera su ministro de Finanzas conocía la decisión de antemano. Cuando decidió imponer la ley marcial en Jammu y Cachemira, el único estado de mayoría musulmana de India, presentó el plan al Parlamento como un hecho, sin pedir su aprobación. Pero esos días han terminado. Los dos mayores partidos que han surgido como nuevos socios de coalición del Partido Popular Indio están liderados por N. Chandrababu Naidu y Nitish Kumar, legisladores veteranos a quienes se conoce como tecnócratas moderados. Es probable que ambos exijan más autoridad en el Parlamento. De hecho, ambos han sido señalados como posibles candidatos a primer ministro, si se produjera otra coalición que no estuviera liderada ni por el Partido Popular Indio ni por el Congreso Nacional Indio. Cuando el martes se dieron a conocer los primeros mapas electorales nacionales que mostraban el número de escaños ganados y perdidos en el Parlamento, se observó una nueva y sorprendente configuración. Los mapas mostraban que el partido de Modi había perdido zonas de territorio en los estados del norte de habla hindi, considerados bastiones del Partido Popular Indio. Al mismo tiempo, el su partido avanzó en regiones que se habían resistido a Modi en el pasado. Perdió decenas de escaños en el estado septentrional de Uttar Pradesh, pero ganó muchos en el estado oriental de Odisha y en el estado meridional de Telangana. La única parte del país que ahora parece unificada por un partido es el “cinturón tribal”, que atraviesa los estados centrales. Sus comunidades relativamente pobres han sido hábilmente puestas en la mira de la política hinduista y los beneficios sociales del Partido Popular Indio. Los inversores de los mercados bursátiles indios de Mumbai respondieron con entusiasmo a las primeras encuestas a pie de urna. El lunes, se lanzaron a la compra, haciendo subir los precios de las llamadas acciones de Modi, aquellas asociadas a las prioridades de gasto del primer ministro o que se cree que se benefician de sus políticas fiscales. Cuando se conocieron los resultados de las urnas, esas acciones se desplomaron. Las acciones del buque insignia del Grupo Adani perdieron cerca del 19 por ciento de su valor en un solo día de cotización. El índice bursátil perdió cerca del 6 por ciento, casi anulando las ganancias de los cinco primeros meses del año. Modi sigue siendo popular entre los magnates de India, pero los inversores deben averiguar qué empresas se beneficiarán del nuevo gobierno. Chris Wood, responsable mundial de estrategia de renta variable del banco de inversión Jefferies, advirtió el año pasado que si Modi perdía, “cabría esperar una corrección del 25 por ciento, si no más”, en el mercado bursátil indio. Históricamente, a las empresas indias les ha ido igual de bien durante los periodos de gobierno de coalición. Por lo tanto, Wood dijo que, incluso sin Modi en el poder, espera que las acciones “se recuperen bruscamente” sobre la base de la fortaleza de la economía del país en su conjunto. Esta nueva era en el Parlamento empezará seguramente con algunas rondas de retribuciones políticas. Los políticos que no hayan conseguido escaños para sus jefes serán despedidos. Es probable que los partidos más pequeños exijan puestos en el gabinete, lo que significará sustituir a miembros del Partido Popular Indio. Habrá que revisar las políticas. ¿Se inclinará India por la exportación de manufacturas, con el objetivo de sustituir a China como la fábrica del mundo? ¿Protegerá ahora a las industrias locales que temen la competencia extranjera? Milan Vaishnav, investigador de la Fundación Carnegie para la Paz Internacional, advirtió que India no puede volver exactamente a la política de coalición que precedió a Modi. Es probable que sus nuevos socios exijan un estilo autoritario similar al que Modi ejerce desde Nueva Delhi. El tipo de líderes estatales que necesita ahora como socios de coalición “son tan absolutistas como el gobierno nacional”, dijo Vaishnav. Podrían, por ejemplo, pedir a la policía federal que detuviera a sus oponentes, como ha hecho Modi. Las elecciones de India fueron las mayores celebradas en la historia de la democracia, con más de 600 millones de votantes en seis fases. Esta vez no hubo quejas sobre las máquinas de votación electrónica, ni temores de que India se hubiera convertido en una dictadura bajo el mandato de Modi. En un discurso difícil pronunciado el martes por la noche desde la sede del Partido Popular Indio, Modi calificó las elecciones de “celebración de la democracia”.",estamos en whatsapp empieza

With that loss, Mr. Modi’s air of invincibility also appeared to be fading for the first time since he took office in 2014. The election results were especially shocking because, after nearly seven sweaty weeks of voting across the country, exit polls released just days before the final tally showed that Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party would win in a landslide, as it had twice before. Instead, the Bharatiya Janata Party won only 240 seats, well short of the 272 needed to form a government. The opposition alliance, led by the Indian National Congress Party, took 235 seats. With the 52 seats won by B.J.P. allies, Mr. Modi will remain on top. But his allure has been diminished, and his leadership has fundamentally changed. When Mr. Modi came to power in 2014, he promised economic progress, an end to corruption and to promote Hinduism as being central to India’s identity. Through it all, he presented himself as a uniquely strong leader, capable of marshaling his followers to work for the nation. This was in contrast to the previous government. Before Mr. Modi was first elected, India spent 25 years being governed by coalitions. Prime ministers from the Congress Party, the B.J.P. and smaller third parties took turns running India by committee. Mr. Modi broke with that tradition, leading a new single-party system dominated by the B.J.P. As leader, Mr. Modi showed little interest in sharing power. When he invalidated most of India’s paper currency in 2016, not even his finance minister knew about the decision in advance. When he decided to impose de facto martial law on Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state, he presented the plan to Parliament as a done deal, without seeking approval. But those days are over. The two biggest parties that have emerged as the B.J.P.’s new coalition partners are led by N. Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar, veteran lawmakers who are known as technocratic moderates. Both are likely to demand greater authority in Parliament. In fact, both have been eyed as possible candidates for prime minister, if there were to be another coalition led by neither the B.J.P. nor the Congress. When the first nationwide electoral maps showing the number of seats gained and lost in Parliament were revealed on Tuesday, they showed a striking new pattern. The maps showed that Mr. Modi’s party lost swaths of territory across states in the Hindi-speaking north that were considered B.J.P. strongholds. At the same time, the B.J.P. made inroads in regions that had resisted Mr. Modi in the past. He lost dozens of seats in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, but he gained plenty in the eastern state of Odisha and the southern state of Telangana. The only part of the country that now looks unified by one party is the “tribal belt,” which weaves across the central states. Its relatively poor communities have been skillfully targeted by the B.J.P.’s Hindu-first politics and welfare benefits. Investors in India’s stock markets in Mumbai responded eagerly to the early exit polls. On Monday, they went on a buying spree, driving up the prices of so-called Modi stocks, those associated with the prime minister’s spending priorities or thought to benefit from his fiscal policies. When the actual vote results were counted, those stocks came crashing down. Shares in the Adani Group’s flagship stock lost about 19 percent of their value in one day of trading. The blue-chip index lost about 6 percent, nearly wiping out its gains from the first five months of the year. Mr. Modi remains popular with India’s business tycoons, but investors need to find out which companies will stand to benefit from a new government. Chris Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, an investment bank, warned last year that if Mr. Modi were to lose he “would expect a 25 percent correction, if not more” in the Indian stock market. Historically, Indian companies have done just as well during periods of coalition government. So, Mr. Wood said, even without Mr. Modi in power, he expects stocks to “bounce back sharply” based on the strength of the country’s economy as a whole. This new era in Parliament is sure to begin with a few rounds of political retribution. Politicians who failed to deliver seats for their bosses will be shown the door. Smaller parties are likely to demand cabinet positions, which will mean replacing members of the B.J.P. Policies will need to be revised. Will India lean into export manufacturing, aiming to replace China as the world’s factory? Will it move to protect local industries that fear foreign competition? Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, cautioned that India cannot exactly return to the coalition politics that preceded Mr. Modi. His new partners are likely to make demands that match the authoritarian style Mr. Modi exercises from New Delhi. The kind of state leaders he now needs as coalition partners “are just as absolutist as the national government,” Mr. Vaishnav said. They could, for instance, call for federal police agencies to arrest opponents, as Mr. Modi has done. India’s election was the biggest conducted in the history of democracy, with more than 600 million voters casting ballots in six phases. This time, there were no complaints about the electronic voting machines, or fears that India had become a dictatorship under Mr. Modi. In a difficult speech delivered on Tuesday night from the B.J.P. headquarters, Mr. Modi called the election a “celebration of democracy.”",narendra modis first decade india prime minister came fair share surprise none however looked anything like happened tuesday morning second reelection lost party majority parliament loss mr modis air invincibility also appeared fading first time since took office election result especially shocking nearly seven sweaty week voting across country exit poll released day final tally showed mr modis bharatiya janata party would win landslide twice instead bharatiya janata party seat well short needed form government opposition alliance led indian national congress party took seat seat bjp ally mr modi remain top allure diminished leadership fundamentally changed mr modi came power promised economic progress end corruption promote hinduism central india identity presented uniquely strong leader capable marshaling follower work nation contrast previous government mr modi first elected india spent year governed coalition prime minister congress party bjp smaller third party took turn running india committee mr modi broke tradition leading new singleparty system dominated bjp leader mr modi showed little interest sharing power invalidated india paper currency even finance minister knew decision advance decided impose de facto martial law jammu kashmir india muslimmajority state presented plan parliament done deal without seeking approval day two biggest party emerged bjps new coalition partner led n chandrababu naidu nitish kumar veteran lawmaker known technocratic moderate likely demand greater authority parliament fact eyed possible candidate prime minister another coalition led neither bjp congress first nationwide electoral map showing number seat gained lost parliament revealed tuesday showed striking new pattern map showed mr modis party lost swath territory across state hindispeaking north considered bjp stronghold time bjp made inroad region resisted mr modi past lost dozen seat northern state uttar pradesh gained plenty eastern state odisha southern state telangana part country look unified one party tribal belt weave across central state relatively poor community skillfully targeted bjps hindufirst politics welfare benefit investor india stock market mumbai responded eagerly early exit poll monday went buying spree driving price socalled modi stock associated prime minister spending priority thought benefit fiscal policy actual vote result counted stock came crashing share adani group flagship stock lost percent value one day trading bluechip index lost percent nearly wiping gain first five month year mr modi remains popular india business tycoon investor need find company stand benefit new government chris wood global head equity strategy jefferies investment bank warned last year mr modi lose would expect percent correction indian stock market historically indian company done well period coalition government mr wood said even without mr modi power expects stock bounce back sharply based strength country economy whole new era parliament sure begin round political retribution politician failed deliver seat boss shown door smaller party likely demand cabinet position mean replacing member bjp policy need revised india lean export manufacturing aiming replace china world factory move protect local industry fear foreign competition milan vaishnav senior fellow carnegie endowment international peace cautioned india exactly return coalition politics preceded mr modi new partner likely make demand match authoritarian style mr modi exercise new delhi kind state leader need coalition partner absolutist national government mr vaishnav said could instance call federal police agency arrest opponent mr modi done india election biggest conducted history democracy million voter casting ballot six phase time complaint electronic voting machine fear india become dictatorship mr modi difficult speech delivered tuesday night bjp headquarters mr modi called election celebration democracy
nytimes,"Needing Help to Stay in Power, Modi Loses His Aura of Invincibility","June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/modi-india-election.html,"Suddenly, the aura of invincibility around Narendra Modi has been shattered. In an Indian election in which his party’s slogan had promised a landslide victory and Mr. Modi even repeatedly referred to himself as sent by God, the results announced on Tuesday were unexpectedly sobering. Mr. Modi, 73, is set to take up a third consecutive term as prime minister, after the Election Commission gave final confirmation early Wednesday that the parties that make up his coalition had collectively passed the majority mark in Parliament. It is a feat that only one other Indian leader has accomplished, and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., won far more seats than any other party. But instead of a runaway win, the B.J.P. lost dozens of seats. It now finds itself at the mercy of its coalition partners — including one politician notorious for how often he has switched sides — to stay in power, a sharp reversal a decade into Mr. Modi’s transformational tenure. As the results came into view, the country’s stock markets plunged. Opposition parties, newly unified in what they had called an effort to save the country’s democracy, rejoiced. And India, while extending Mr. Modi’s firm hold on power, learned that there are limits to his political potency, even as he made the election, usually fought seat by seat, squarely about himself. Mr. Modi took a more positive view in a statement on X declaring that his coalition had won a third term. “This is a historical feat in India’s history,” he said. For Mr. Modi, a generous reading of the outcome could be that only with his personal push could his party overcome its unpopularity at the local level and scrape by. Or it could be that his carefully cultivated brand has now peaked, and that he can no longer outrun the anti-incumbency sentiment that eventually catches up with almost any politician. How Mr. Modi will react is uncertain — whether he will harden his effort to turn away any challenge to his power, or be chastened by the voters’ verdict and his need to work with coalition partners that do not share his Hindu-nationalist ideology. “Modi is not known as a consensual figure. However, he is very pragmatic,” said Arati Jerath, a political analyst based in New Delhi. “He will have to moderate his hard-line Hindu-nationalist approach to issues. Perhaps we can hope for more moderation from him.” Few doubt, however, that Mr. Modi will try to deepen his already considerable imprint on the country over the next five years. On his watch, India, the world’s most populous nation, has enjoyed newfound prominence on the global stage, overhauled its infrastructure for the needs of its 1.4 billion people, and been imbued with a new sense of ambition as it tries to shed the legacy of its long colonial past. At the same time, Mr. Modi has worked to turn a vastly diverse country held together by a secular democratic system into an overtly Hindu-first state, marginalizing the country’s large Muslim minority. His increasingly authoritarian turn — with a crackdown on dissent that has created a chilling environment of self-censorship — has pushed India’s vociferous democracy closer to a one-party state, his critics say. And the country’s economic growth, while rapid, has mostly enriched those at the top. Mr. Modi rose from a humble background as the son of a tea seller, becoming India’s most powerful and popular leader in decades by building a cult of personality, spending big on infrastructure and welfare, and tilting India’s democratic institutions in his favor. The ultimate goal was to cement his standing as one of the most consequential prime ministers in India’s nearly 75 years as a republic and make the B.J.P. the country’s only plausible national governing force. But the results on Tuesday pointed to a sharp turnaround for India’s beleaguered main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, which had been seen by many as irrevocably weakened after big losses in the previous two elections. The once-dominant Congress, long positioned at India’s political center, struggled for years to find a direction and offer an ideological alternative to the B.J.P. But it and its coalition partners found traction in this election by attacking Mr. Modi’s government over issues like unemployment, social justice and the prime minister’s ties to India’s billionaires. Last year, as Rahul Gandhi, the public face of the Congress party, sought to burnish his standing by leading long marches across India, the B.J.P. ensnared him in a court case that led to his expulsion from Parliament. He was later returned to his seat by India’s highest court, and was set to win re-election on Tuesday. Speaking as early returns came in, Mr. Gandhi, 53, said the fight was not just against the B.J.P. It was also, he said, against all the government institutions that had stood with Mr. Modi in trying to hamstring the opposition through arrests and other punitive actions. “This was about saving the Constitution,” he said, lifting a small copy that he had been carrying with him and displaying during speeches on the campaign trail. Exit polls released on Saturday, after more than six weeks of voting in the world’s largest democratic exercise, indicated that Mr. Modi’s party was headed toward an easy victory. But there had been signs during the campaign that Mr. Modi was worried about the outcome. He crisscrossed the country for more than 200 rallies over about two months and gave dozens of interviews, hoping to use his charismatic appeal to paper over any weaknesses in his party. In speeches, he often veered from his party’s message of a rising India to counter accusations that he privileged business and caste elites. He also abandoned his once-subtle dog whistles targeting India’s 200 million Muslims, instead demonizing them directly, by name. As things stood by nightfall, Mr. Modi would need at least 33 seats from allies to cross the 272 minimum for forming a government. Two regional parties in particular would be kingmakers: the Telugu Desam Party, in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, with 16 seats, and the Janata Dal (United) party in the eastern state of Bihar, with 12. Both parties are avowedly secular, raising hopes among Mr. Modi’s opponents that their influence could slow down his race to turn India’s democracy into a Hindu-first state. Some of Mr. Modi’s biggest losses came in India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh in the north, with about 240 million people. His party leads the state government and had won 62 of the state’s 80 seats in the national Parliament’s lower house in the previous election, in 2019. As counting entered its last stretch in the evening on Tuesday, the B.J.P. was leading in only 33 seats there. In his own constituency, Varanasi, Mr. Modi’s victory margin was reduced from half a million last time to about 150,000. The loss in Faizabad constituency, in particular, told the story of how some of the prime minister’s biggest offerings had struggled to connect with voters. The constituency is home to the lavish Ram temple in Ayodhya, built on grounds disputed between Hindus and Muslims. Its construction was a cornerstone of the nearly century-old Hindu-nationalist movement that had swept Mr. Modi to power. He hoped that its grand inauguration just before the election campaign began would both unite his Hindu support base and bring new supporters into the fold. Some B.J.P. workers said that the party’s flaunting of the temple may have made a large section of Hindus at the bottom of the rigid caste hierarchy uncomfortable. The opposition had painted Mr. Modi as pursuing an upper-caste agenda that denied underprivileged Hindus opportunities to reverse centuries of oppression. “Because of overemphasis on the Ram temple issue, the opposition got united,” said Subhash Punia, 62, a farmer from the state of Rajasthan who supports Mr. Modi and was waiting outside the B.J.P. headquarters in Delhi on Tuesday. To offset potential losses in his Hindi-speaking northern stronghold, Mr. Modi had set a lofty goal for this election: to gain a foothold in the country’s more prosperous south. He broke some new ground in Kerala, a state dominated by the political left and long hostile to his ideology. But overall in the south, he struggled to improve on the 29 seats, out of 129, that his party had won in the previous election. Perhaps the biggest disappointment for the B.J.P. in southern India was that it once again appeared not to have won any of the 40 seats in Tamil Nadu, a state with its own strong cultural and linguistic identity. Mr. Modi had campaigned aggressively there, even visiting one coastal town for two days of meditation as the voting neared its conclusion. “Mr. Modi’s and the B.J.P.’s antics cannot win my Tamil heart,” said S. Ganesan, a waiter at a hotel in Kanniyakumari, the town Mr. Modi visited.",suddenly aura invincibility around narendra modi shattered indian election party slogan promised landslide victory mr modi

nytimes,Modi Will Feel the Heat in a Third Term. And Not Just Politically.,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/climate/modi-climate-india-election.html,"India, the world’s most populous country, is also among the most vulnerable to climate hazards. That’s not only because of the heat and floods that global warming has exacerbated, but also because so many of the country’s 1.4 billion people are vulnerable to begin with. Most people are poor, by global standards, and they have no safety net. Narendra Modi, the Hindu nationalist prime minister who claimed victory Tuesday for a third five-year term, will face major challenges fueled by climate change. The six-week process of voting took place amid a scorching heat wave in several parts of the country. In the northern states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, at least 33 people, including poll workers, died of complications from the heat last week, according to government authorities cited by Reuters. Rohit Magotra, deputy director of Integrated Research and Action for Development, called on national election officials to reschedule elections in the future to avoid such calamities. He pointed out that workers from every political party suffer in the heat, and so do voters, who often have to line up under the sun. “I definitely see the momentum building up, and elections are unlikely to be scheduled in peak summer in future,” said Mr. Magotra, whose organization has advocated heat solutions in Indian cities. The Election Commission this year did set up a task force to monitor weather conditions, but only after voting got underway amid abnormally high temperatures. It also sent election workers a list of heat precautions prepared by the National Disaster Management Agency. However, according to a report published in Scroll, an Indian news site, political-party campaigners were not told to do anything differently because of the heat. While parliamentary elections are traditionally scheduled in summer in India, climate change is making summers increasingly dangerous. This year, one weather station in Delhi broke the all-time temperature record with a reading above 52 degrees Celsius (127 degrees Fahrenheit) in late May. It was the third consecutive year of abnormally high temperatures in India, all made worse by climate change, according to scientific studies of the heat waves. Several cities and states have heat action plans, at least on paper. But as one independent analysis concluded last year, they are mostly underfunded and lack concrete ways to identify and protect the most vulnerable. Mr. Modi’s government has faced some of the most potent opposition in recent years from farmers’ organizations. And many of their concerns are rooted in climate issues. Their agitation reflects a deep malaise in agriculture, a major slice of the Indian economy. More than half of all Indians depend on farming to make a living. Groundwater is in short supply in many important agricultural regions. Farmers are in deep debt in many parts of the country. On top of that, extreme weather and unpredictable rains have wrecked harvests repeatedly in recent years. In 2020, hundreds of thousands of farmers, mostly from India’s breadbasket region of Punjab and Haryana, erected encampments outside of New Delhi and rolled their tractors into the capital in protests that turned violent. Their initial grievance was over Mr. Modi’s efforts to open up more private investment in agriculture, which the farmers said would make them vulnerable to low prices driven by corporate profit motives. In the face of the uprising, the government backed down, a rarity for Mr. Modi, but also a move that signals the seriousness with which his administration took the protests. Again this year, farmers marched on the capital, this time demanding higher government-set prices for wheat and rice. The global image of India is often associated with its fast-growing economy, its vibrant cities and its huge, young work force. But a majority of its people still depend on farm incomes, most of its 770 million poor people live in the countryside, and the government has been unable to create anywhere near the number of jobs outside agriculture that its booming youth population demands. Fixing agriculture in the era of climate change is likely to be among Mr. Modi’s most profound challenges in the coming years. “Definitely, increasing extreme weather events (floods, heat waves, storms) are the most important climate challenge facing the government,” said M. Rajeevan, a former secretary in the Earth Sciences Ministry who is now vice chancellor at Atria University in Bengaluru. Climate change is driven principally by the burning of fossil fuels, the dirtiest of which is coal. At international summits, Mr. Modi has emphasized his push to build renewable energy infrastructure. At the same time though, his government has continued to expand coal. That’s driven by both political and economic considerations. Coal is the incumbent fuel. Public and private companies, many of them politically connected, are invested in coal. The government’s main interest is in keeping electricity prices low. Coal remains the country’s biggest source of electricity. Coal use grew this year, partly driven by climate change itself. Higher temperatures drive up demand for air-conditioners and fans, which drives up demand for electricity. India’s power-sector emissions soared in the first quarter of 2024, according to Ember, a research organization that tracks emissions. Coal provides more than 70 percent of India’s electricity, with solar and wind accounting for a little more than 10 percent. And even though the government has set an ambitious target of 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030, coal’s influence is unlikely to dim anytime soon. According to government projections, coal will still supply more than half of India’s electricity in 2030.",india world populous country also among vulnerable climate hazard thats heat flood global warming exacerbated also many country billion people vulnerable begin people poor global standard safety net narendra modi hindu nationalist prime minister claimed victory tuesday third fiveyear term face major challenge fueled climate change sixweek process voting took place amid scorching heat wave several part country northern state bihar uttar pradesh least people including poll worker died complication heat last week according government authority cited reuters rohit magotra deputy director integrated research action development called national election official reschedule election future avoid calamity pointed worker every political party suffer heat voter often line sun definitely see momentum building election unlikely scheduled peak summer future said mr magotra whose organization advocated heat solution indian city election commission year set task force monitor weather condition voting got underway amid abnormally high temperature also sent election worker list heat precaution prepared national disaster management agency however according report published scroll indian news site politicalparty campaigner told anything differently heat parliamentary election traditionally scheduled summer india climate change making summer increasingly dangerous year one weather station delhi broke alltime temperature record reading degree celsius degree fahrenheit late may third consecutive year abnormally high temperature india made worse climate change according scientific study heat wave several city state heat action plan least paper one independent analysis concluded last year mostly underfunded lack concrete way identify protect vulnerable mr modis government faced potent opposition recent year farmer organization many concern rooted climate issue agitation reflects deep malaise agriculture major slice indian economy half indian depend farming make living groundwater short supply many important agricultural region farmer deep debt many part country top extreme weather unpredictable rain wrecked harvest repeatedly recent year hundred thousand farmer mostly india breadbasket region punjab haryana erected encampment outside new delhi rolled tractor capital protest turned violent initial grievance mr modis effort open private investment agriculture farmer said would make vulnerable low price driven corporate profit motif face uprising government backed rarity mr modi also move signal seriousness administration took protest year farmer marched capital time demanding higher governmentset price wheat rice global image india often associated fastgrowing economy vibrant city huge young work force majority people still depend farm income million poor people live countryside government unable create anywhere near number job outside agriculture booming youth population demand fixing agriculture era climate change likely among mr modis profound challenge coming year definitely increasing extreme weather event flood heat wave storm important climate challenge facing government said rajeevan former secretary earth science ministry vice chancellor atrium university bengaluru climate change driven principally burning fossil fuel dirtiest coal international summit mr modi emphasized push build renewable energy infrastructure time though government continued expand coal thats driven political economic consideration coal incumbent fuel public private company many politically connected invested coal government main interest keeping electricity price low coal remains country biggest source electricity coal use grew year partly driven climate change higher temperature drive demand airconditioners fan drive demand electricity india powersector emission soared first quarter according ember research organization track emission coal provides percent india electricity solar wind accounting little percent even though government set ambitious target gigawatts renewable energy capacity coal influence unlikely dim anytime soon according government projection coal still supply half india electricity
nytimes,India’s Stock Market Tumbles on Close-Run Election Result,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-stock-market-election.html,"Traders in Mumbai started the day with a shock as India began tallying votes from a seven-week election and it became clear that the government of Narendra Modi was not doing nearly as well as expected. By the end of trading on Tuesday, the markets were down 6 percent, nearly wiping out the year’s gains. India’s stock market had been on a tear, buoyed by economic growth and confidence that Mr. Modi, the most powerful prime minister in generations, was sure to secure a third term in office. Investors looking to India yearn for political stability and many have done especially well during the first 10 years of Mr. Modi’s pro-business leadership. Even after Tuesday’s decline, the blue-chip Nifty 50 index has nearly tripled since Mr. Modi became prime minister. But the Indian market’s main indexes have entered choppier waters on the way to the election. Some companies, namely those considered “Modi stocks,” fared especially poorly as the election result came into view. The Adani Group’s fortunes were always the most eye-catching. Gautam Adani rapidly became Asia’s richest man, as his infrastructure-oriented businesses worked in harmony with Mr. Modi’s plans for the country. That is, until a short-seller’s report in early 2023 accused the Adani Group of market manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani’s stocks crashed, but within a year, as it became clear that the Indian government and many of the world’s biggest banks would be patient with the companies, they climbed back up. On Tuesday, Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship company, shed 19 percent of its value, putting it halfway between its peak and subsequent trough. Mr. Modi has anyway won enough seats to form a new government, albeit with a much slimmer majority than forecast. Chris Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, an investment bank, last year gamed out an even worse result for Mr. Modi, saying during an investor summit in October that if Mr. Modi were suddenly defeated, “I would expect a 25 percent correction if not more.” Some degree of correction might be welcomed, at least among professional investors. A lot of the market’s recent growth has reflected the influx of small-time local investors buying stocks for the first time. With global investors clamoring for access to India’s long-term prospects, it had become nearly impossible to find bargains. Christine Phillpotts, portfolio manager for emerging markets at Ariel Investments in Chicago, said India had become “the market that everybody loves to love.” That meant there weren’t many opportunities left, even though she agreed that India’s economy would keep growing robustly. The other consolation is that, as much as investors need to know which government policies will favor which companies, India’s track record suggests that its economy is capable of growing rapidly under conditions of vigorous, multiparty democracy. Some of the fastest rates it ever clocked were achieved under a previous coalition government, during a growth spurt from 2006 to 2010.

It was a stinging electoral blow for the Congress, a once-dominant party that has appeared greatly diminished in recent years, and exit polls in this year’s election had not suggested it would fare much better. But early election results on Tuesday indicated a far stronger showing than expected for the Congress. The party and its allies were leading in nearly 230 races, a sharp turnaround that prompted jubilation at the Congress headquarters in New Delhi, where supporters erupted in cheers each time a television channel announced a new lead for one of its candidates. “Whatever the final results, one thing is clear — it is a moral victory for Congress and our leader Rahul Gandhi, and defeat for B.J.P.,” said Robin Michael, a political worker, referring to Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. While there was no indication that Congress and the opposition coalition it leads would scrape together a majority to unseat Mr. Modi, party workers said that they had dented Mr. Modi’s aura of invincibility. They praised Mr. Gandhi, the Congress party’s most prominent figure and a great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first post-independence prime minister. Last year, as Mr. Gandhi sought to burnish his standing by leading long marches across India, the B.J.P. ensnared him in a court case that led to his expulsion from Parliament. He was later returned to his seat by India’s highest court. On Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi was on track to win his parliamentary seat in the southern state of Kerala. The Congress, long positioned at India’s political center, has struggled to find a direction and offer an ideological alternative to the Hindu nationalist B.J.P. It has faced rebellions, infighting and periodic fits of soul-searching over whether to rally behind a new face — only to stick with its dynastic leadership. This year, despite expectations, Mr. Gandhi had set a target of doubling the party’s 2019 tally of 52 seats. By late Tuesday afternoon, it was leading in nearly 100 seats. “We will stop Modi from making a mockery of this country and turning people against each other,” said Sandeep Mishra, a Congress worker at party headquarters. He added: “Indians are fed up with Modi.”",india last general election prime minister narendra modis party parliamentary seat nearly six time many main opposition party indian national congress stinging electoral blow congress oncedominant party appeared greatly diminished recent year exit poll year election suggested would fare much better early election result tuesday indicated far stronger showing expected congress party ally leading nearly race sharp turnaround prompted jubilation congress headquarters new delhi supporter erupted cheer time television channel announced new lead one candidate whatever final result one thing clear moral victory congress leader rahul gandhi defeat bjp said robin michael political worker referring mr modis bharatiya janata party indication congress opposition coalition lead would scrape together majority unseat mr modi party worker said dented mr modis aura invincibility praised mr gandhi congress party prominent figure greatgrandson jawaharlal nehru india first postindependence prime minister last year mr gandhi sought burnish standing leading long march across india bjp ensnared court case led expulsion parliament later returned seat india highest court tuesday mr gandhi track win parliamentary seat southern state kerala congress long positioned india political center struggled find direction offer ideological alternative hindu nationalist bjp faced rebellion infighting periodic fit soulsearching whether rally behind new face stick dynastic leadership year despite expectation mr gandhi set target doubling party tally seat late tuesday afternoon leading nearly seat stop modi making mockery country turning people said sandeep mishra congress worker party headquarters added indian fed modi

nytimes,Modi’s Party May Need Partners to Form a Government,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/modi-bjp-india-government-coalition.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party will likely need help from junior partners to form a government under the rules of India’s parliamentary system, early election results indicated on Tuesday. In a 2019 election that handed Mr. Modi a second consecutive term, his Bharatiya Janata Party won 303 of the 543 seats in Parliament. That was well over the 272 seats it needed to rule on its own. This time, exit polls released over the weekend suggested that the B.J.P. would once again easily win more than 272 seats. But as of early Tuesday afternoon, official voting results indicated that it would win about 240 seats instead. Winning that much support — 44 percent of the seats in Parliament’s lower house — is an impressive feat in India or any other country. And the new math should not prevent Mr. Modi from securing a third consecutive term as prime minister. But the dip in the B.J.P.’s electoral support, far short of Mr. Modi’s goal and his last electoral performance, will likely have political ramifications. At a minimum, the B.J.P. will have to depend more on the junior members of its existing multiparty alliance. Two of the most prominent parties do not share Mr. Modi’s Hindu-first agenda. And if the governing alliance does not win a majority, the B.J.P. will be able to form a government only by adding new partners. It may not come to that. As of Tuesday afternoon the alliance was on track to scrape by with a narrow parliamentary majority — far short of its target of 400 seats, but enough to stay in power with its existing members.",prime minister narendra modis ruling party likely need help junior partner form government rule india parliamentary system early election result indicated tuesday election handed mr modi second consecutive term bharatiya janata party seat parliament well seat needed rule time exit poll released weekend suggested bjp would easily win seat early tuesday afternoon official voting result indicated would win seat instead winning much support percent seat parliament lower house impressive feat india country new math prevent mr modi securing third consecutive term prime minister dip bjps electoral support far short mr modis goal last electoral performance likely political ramification minimum bjp depend junior member existing multiparty alliance two prominent party share mr modis hindufirst agenda governing alliance win majority bjp able form government adding new partner may come tuesday afternoon alliance track scrape narrow parliamentary majority far short target seat enough stay power existing member
nytimes,How Modi Capitalized on India’s Economic Rise,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-election-economy.html,"Ten years after Narendra Modi was first elected prime minister, India’s economy is roughly twice as large. That is what happens when a country grows at 7 percent a year, as India has been doing, on average, since it opened its markets to international competition in 1991. That steady growth has been skillfully repackaged to promote an image of one man’s leadership making it all happen. Along with nationalism and Hindu pride, the idea that Mr. Modi can make the economy move has been central to his appeal since the beginning. And Mr. Modi has burnished India’s economy in ways that count the most with voters: He made visible infrastructure expansions and distributed welfare benefits to the majority of Indians, who remain poor by global standards even as the country’s higher-income groups learn to flex their spending power. Most of the rest of the world — especially the United States and other Western countries that hope to persuade India to join them in constraining China’s and Russia’s strategic ambitions — wants India’s economy to accelerate. Part of that story could be a shift in manufacturing, like the one Apple has underway in South India. And the world’s investment professionals are eager for India’s successes under Mr. Modi to start paying dividends that they can’t find elsewhere. But even the most eager investors can’t overlook some of the problems that confront India as it becomes the world’s newest heavyweight. While Mr. Modi basked in the glow of a successful moon landing and the country’s innovative “digital public infrastructure,” the political opposition tried to speak past him to the frustrated masses who clamor for more and better jobs. The opposition also tried rousing public anger over Mr. Modi’s ties with the country’s biggest tycoons. That seems not to have worked, neither in politics nor in the markets, in the case of Gautam Adani. Last year the billionaire’s empire was accused, with much flash and fury, of stock manipulation. But the claims hardly broke through, and Adani stocks went back to soaring.",ten year narendra modi first elected prime minister india economy roughly twice large happens country grows percent year india average since opened market international competition steady growth skillfully repackaged promote image one man leadership making happen along nationalism hindu pride idea mr modi make economy move central appeal since beginning mr modi burnished india economy way count voter made visible infrastructure expansion distributed welfare benefit majority indian remain poor global standard even country higherincome group learn flex spending power rest world especially united state western country hope persuade india join constraining china russia strategic ambition want india economy accelerate part story could shift manufacturing like one apple underway south india world investment professional eager india success mr modi start paying dividend cant find elsewhere even eager investor cant overlook problem confront india becomes world newest heavyweight mr modi basked glow successful moon landing country innovative digital public infrastructure political opposition tried speak past frustrated mass clamor better job opposition also tried rousing public anger mr modis tie country biggest tycoon seems worked neither politics market case gautam adani last year billionaire empire accused much flash fury stock manipulation claim hardly broke adani stock went back soaring
nytimes,The Heat Wave Scenario That Keeps Climate Scientists Up at Night,"June 3, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/opinion/heat-technology-climate.html,"On a recent Thursday evening, a freakish windstorm called a derecho (Spanish for “straight ahead”) hit Houston, a city of more than two million people that also happens to be the epicenter of the fossil fuel industry in America. In a matter of minutes, winds of up to 100 miles per hour blew out office building windows, uprooted trees and toppled electric poles and transmission towers. Nearly a million households lost power. Which meant that not only was there no light; there was no air-conditioning. The damage from the storm was so extensive that, five days later, more than 100,000 homes and businesses were still marooned in the heat and darkness. Luckily, the day the derecho blew in, the temperature in Houston, a city infamous for its swampy summers, was in the low to mid-80s. Hot, to be sure, but for most healthy people, not life-threatening. Of the at least eight deaths reported as a result of the storm, none were from heat exposure. But if this storm had arrived several days later, perhaps over the Memorial Day weekend, when the temperature in Houston hit 96 degrees, with a heat index as high as 115, it might have been a very different story. “The Hurricane Katrina of extreme heat” is how Mikhail Chester, director of the Metis Center for Infrastructure and Sustainable Engineering at Arizona State University, once put it to me, echoing the memory of the catastrophic 2005 hurricane that struck Louisiana, devastated New Orleans and killed more than 1,300 people. Most people who died in Louisiana during Katrina died from drownings, injuries or heart conditions. But Dr. Chester was using Katrina as a metaphor for what can happen to a city unprepared for an extreme climate catastrophe. In New Orleans, the levee system was overwhelmed by torrential rains; eventually, 80 percent of the city was underwater. What if, instead, the electricity goes out for several days during a blistering summer heat wave in a city that depends on air-conditioning? In Dr. Chester’s scenario, a compounding crisis of extreme heat and a power failure in a major city like Houston could lead to cascading failures, exposing vulnerabilities in the region’s infrastructure that are difficult to foresee and could result in thousands, or even tens of thousands, of deaths from heat exposure in a matter of days. The risk to people in cities would be higher because all the concrete and asphalt amplifies the heat, pushing temperatures in the midafternoon as much as 15 degrees to 20 degrees higher than in surrounding vegetated areas. The derecho that hit Houston was a warning of just how quickly risks are multiplying in our rapidly warming world. As if to prove this point, some 10 days after the Houston blackout, another windstorm knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses in and around Dallas. One of the most dangerous illusions of the climate crisis is that the technology of modern life makes us invincible. Humans are smart. We have tools. Yeah, it will cost money. But we can adapt to whatever comes our way. As for the coral reefs that bleach in the hot oceans and the howler monkeys that fell dead out of trees during a recent heat wave in Mexico, well, that’s sad, but life goes on. This is, of course, an extremely privileged point of view. For one thing, more than 750 million people on the planet don’t have access to electricity, much less air-conditioning. (In India, New Delhi experienced temperatures as high as 120 degrees last week, leading to an increase in heatstroke, fears of blackouts and the possibility of water rationing.) But it is also a naïve point of view, if only because our bubble of invincibility is far more fragile than we know. So what can we expect in a heat Katrina? Last year, researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology, Arizona State University and the University of Michigan published a study looking at the consequences of a major blackout during an extreme heat wave in three cities: Phoenix, Detroit and Atlanta. In the study, the cause of the blackout was unspecified. “It doesn’t really matter if the blackout is the result of a cyberattack or a hurricane,” Brian Stone, the director of the Urban Climate Lab at Georgia Tech and the lead author on the study, told me. “For the purposes of our research, the effect is the same.” Whatever the cause, the study noted that the number of major blackouts in the United States more than doubled from 2015-16 to 2020-21. Dr. Stone and his colleagues focused on those three American cities because they have different demographics, climates and dependence on air-conditioning. In Detroit, 53 percent of buildings have central air-conditioning; in Atlanta, 94 percent; in Phoenix, 99 percent. The researchers modeled the health consequences for residents in a two-day, citywide blackout during a heat wave, with electricity gradually restored over the next three days. The results were shocking: In Phoenix, about 800,000 people — roughly half the population — would need emergency medical treatment for heatstroke and other illnesses. The flood of people seeking care would overwhelm the city’s hospitals. More than 13,000 people would die. Under the same scenario in Atlanta, researchers found there would be 12,540 visits to emergency rooms. Six people would die. In Detroit, which has a higher percentage of older residents and a higher poverty rate than those other cities, 221 people would die. Perhaps we should not be surprised by these numbers. Researchers estimate that in Europe there were 61,672 heat-related deaths in the summer of 2022, the hottest season on record on the continent at the time. In June 2021, a heat wave led to in nearly 900 excess deaths in the Pacific Northwest. And in 2010, an estimated 56,000 Russians died during a record summer heat wave. The hotter it gets, the more difficult it is for our bodies to cope, raising the risk of heatstroke and other heat illnesses. And it is getting hotter across the planet. Last year was the warmest year on record, and the 10 hottest years have all occurred in the last decade. In the study simulating a heat wave in those three cities, researchers found that the much larger death toll in Phoenix was explained by two factors. First, the temperatures modeled during a heat wave in Phoenix (90 to 113 degrees) were much higher than the temperatures in Atlanta (77 to 97 degrees) or Detroit (72 to 95 degrees), which have historically had milder heat waves. And second, the greater availability of air-conditioning in Phoenix means the risks from a power failure during a heat wave are much higher. A lot can be done to reduce these risks. Building cities with less concrete and asphalt and more parks and trees and access to rivers and lakes would help. So would a more sophisticated nationally standardized heat wave warning system. Major cities also need to identify the most vulnerable residents and develop targeted emergency response plans and long-term heat management plans. Making the grid itself more resilient is equally important. Better digital firewalls at grid operation centers thwart hacker intrusions. Burying transmission lines protects them from storms. Batteries to store electricity for emergencies are increasingly inexpensive. But the hotter it gets, the more vulnerable the grid becomes, even as demand for electricity spikes because customers are running their air-conditioning full throttle. Transmission lines sag, transformers explode, power plants fail. One 2016 study found the potential for cascading grid failures across Arizona to increase thirtyfold in response to a 1.8 degree rise in summer temperatures. “Most of the problems with the grid on hot days come from breakdowns at power plants or on the grid caused by the heat itself, or from the difficulty of meeting high demand for cooling,” Doug Lewin, a grid expert and author of the Texas Energy and Power newsletter, told me. The best way to fix that, Mr. Lewin argued, is to encourage people to reduce power demand in their homes with high efficiency heat pumps, better insulation and smart thermostats, and to generate their own power with solar panels and battery storage. The looming threat of a heat Katrina is a reminder of how technological progress creates new risks even as it solves old ones. On a brutally hot day during a recent trip to Jaipur, India, I visited an 18th-century building that had an indoor fountain, thick walls and a ventilation system to channel the wind through each room. There was no air-conditioning, but the building was as cool and comfortable as a new office tower in Houston. Air-conditioning may indeed be a modern necessity that many of us who live in hot parts of the world can’t survive without. But it is also a technology of forgetting. Once upon a time, people understood the dangers of extreme heat and designed ways to live with it. And now, as temperatures rise as a result of our hellbent consumption of fossil fuels, tens of thousands of lives may depend on remembering how that was done. Or finding better ways to do it.",recent thursday evening freakish windstorm called derecho spanish straight ahead hit houston city two million people also happens epicenter fossil fuel industry

nytimes,"As Voting Ends in India, Modi Awaits a Verdict on His 10 Years in Power","June 1, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/world/asia/india-election-modi.html,"Voting in India’s general election, a six-week-long referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decade in power, came to a close on Saturday as much of the country’s populous north was gripped by a deadly heat wave. Results will be tallied and announced on Tuesday. Mr. Modi, his power deeply entrenched, is seen as likely to win a third consecutive term as prime minister, which would make him only the second leader in India’s nearly 75 years as a republic to achieve that feat. Exit polls released after the last round of voting suggested a comfortable return for his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. A newly united opposition has put up a fight, rallying against Mr. Modi’s divisive politics and management of India’s deeply unequal economic growth. But the exit polls indicated it was struggling to significantly cut into the sizable majority in the 543-seat Parliament held by Mr. Modi’s party. In a message of thanks after the voting closed, Mr. Modi expressed confidence that “the people of India have voted in record numbers to re-elect” his government. But Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the largest opposition party, the Indian National Congress, played down the exit polls as “government surveys” and said the official results will show that his alliance was ahead. The election, held in phases over a month and a half, is the largest democratic exercise in the world, with more than 950 million eligible voters. The last stretch of the campaigning drew large rallies even as northern India baked under an intense heat wave, with temperatures frequently exceeding 110 degrees Fahrenheit, or more than 43 degrees Celsius. At least 19 poll workers have died from heat strokes or other health complications resulting from the heat in recent days. Elections in a parliamentary system like India’s are usually fought seat by seat, with a candidate’s fate determined by local economic and social factors. But the B.J.P. made its parliamentary campaign into a presidential-style referendum, putting the focus almost entirely on Mr. Modi and his leadership. The party hoped that Mr. Modi’s deep popularity would help it overcome a growing anti-incumbent sentiment 10 years into the B.J.P.’s rule. Mr. Modi held about 200 rallies across the country over more than two months of campaigning, hoping to lift up struggling candidates in his party. He also went on a media blitz, giving about 80 interviews to television stations and newspapers, almost all of them friendly to him. As the campaigning ended and a mandatory two-day election pause was set to begin, Mr. Modi retreated south to the memorial of one of India’s most celebrated monks for two days of meditation. The country’s media followed. The stream of videos and photos put out by his office, shot from multiple angles in a place where photography is usually not allowed, led the nightly news and television debates. Mr. Modi’s opponents cried foul, saying that the exercise amounted to prohibited campaigning — and that it exemplified the uneven playing field he has created. “The weather is good. The prime minister is sitting in meditation there and he has mellowed the sun goddess,” Ravi Kishan, an actor and B.J.P. candidate, told local media outlets. “This is historic — amidst intense heat, the wind started blowing today.” The opposition, hamstrung by arrests and other punitive actions as part of a crackdown, still mustered its most united front in years. Opposition leaders painted Mr. Modi as a friend to billionaires who has struggled to create jobs for the country’s large youth population. They called his party elitist, accusing it of not lifting up those in the middle and lower ends of India’s caste system. The opposition has stoked fears that if the B.J.P. remained in power, it might change the country’s Constitution to do away with affirmative action for middle and lower castes, a system put in place many decades ago to address centuries of oppression in India’s rigidly hierarchical society. Mr. Modi has vehemently rejected the charges as unfounded; the party under him has increased its outreach to lower castes. To try to keep his Hindu support base united, he turned to anti-Muslim rhetoric, leveling attacks that were unusually direct for him in recent years. The opposition has also tried to win over voters by promising a long list of welfare offerings, including the waiving of farmers’ loans, cash transfers for women and paid apprenticeships for the young. Mr. Modi, on the other hand, has stuck to an image of fiscal prudence, only highlighting his existing offerings. That, his party members say, was because he was confident of winning a third term, and he did not want to over-promise. But even though the opposition seemed to gain some traction, it faces an uphill task in unseating Mr. Modi’s government. He has built a huge electoral advantage with a robust and well-funded political machinery. In the last election, Mr. Modi’s party won 303 seats, nearly six times as many as its closest national competitor, the Indian National Congress party.",voting india general election sixweeklong referendum prime minister narendra modis decade power came close saturday much country populous north gripped deadly heat wave result tallied announced tuesday mr modi power deeply entrenched seen likely win third consecutive term prime minister would make second leader india nearly year republic achieve feat exit poll released last round voting suggested comfortable return hindunationalist bharatiya janata party bjp newly united opposition put fight rallying mr modis divisive politics management india deeply unequal economic growth exit poll indicated struggling significantly cut sizable majority seat parliament held mr modis party message thanks voting closed mr modi expressed confidence people india voted record number reelect government mallikarjun kharge president largest opposition party indian national congress played exit poll government survey said official result show alliance ahead election held phase month half largest democratic exercise world million eligible voter last stretch campaigning drew large rally even northern india baked intense heat wave temperature frequently exceeding degree fahrenheit degree celsius least poll worker died heat stroke health complication resulting heat recent day election parliamentary system like india usually fought seat seat candidate fate determined local economic social factor bjp made parliamentary campaign presidentialstyle referendum putting focus almost entirely mr modi leadership party hoped mr modis deep popularity would help overcome growing antiincumbent sentiment year bjps rule mr modi held rally across country two month campaigning hoping lift struggling candidate party also went medium blitz giving interview television station newspaper almost friendly campaigning ended mandatory twoday election pause set begin mr modi retreated south memorial one india celebrated monk two day meditation country medium followed stream video photo put office shot multiple angle place photography usually allowed led nightly news television debate mr modis opponent cried foul saying exercise amounted prohibited campaigning exemplified uneven playing field created weather good prime minister sitting meditation mellowed sun goddess ravi kishan actor bjp candidate told local medium outlet historic amidst intense heat wind started blowing today opposition hamstrung arrest punitive action part crackdown still mustered united front year opposition leader painted mr modi friend billionaire struggled create job country large youth population called party elitist accusing lifting middle lower end india caste system opposition stoked fear bjp remained power might change country constitution away affirmative action middle lower caste system put place many decade ago address century oppression india rigidly hierarchical society mr modi vehemently rejected charge unfounded party increased outreach lower caste try keep hindu support base united turned antimuslim rhetoric leveling attack unusually direct recent year opposition also tried win voter promising long list welfare offering including waiving farmer loan cash transfer woman paid apprenticeship young mr modi hand stuck image fiscal prudence highlighting existing offering party member say confident winning third term want overpromise even though opposition seemed gain traction face uphill task unseating mr modis government built huge electoral advantage robust wellfunded political machinery last election mr modis party seat nearly six time many closest national competitor indian national congress party
nytimes,A Small Army Combating a Flood of Deepfakes in India’s Election,"June 1, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/world/asia/india-election-deepfakes.html,"Through the middle of a high-stakes election being held during a mind-melting heat wave, a blizzard of confusing deepfakes blows across India. The variety seems endless: A.I.-powered mimicry, ventriloquy and deceptive editing effects. Some of it is crude, some jokey, some so obviously fake that it could never be expected to be seen as real. The overall effect is confounding, adding to a social media landscape already inundated with misinformation. The volume of online detritus is far too great for any election commission to track, let alone debunk. A diverse bunch of vigilante fact-checking outfits have sprung up to fill the breach. While the wheels of law grind slowly and unevenly, the job of tracking down deepfakes has been taken up by hundreds of government workers and private fact-checking groups based in India. “We have to be ready,” said Surya Sen, a forestry officer in the state of Karnataka who has been reassigned during the election to manage a team of 70 people hunting down deceptive A.I.-generated content. “Social media is a battleground this year.” When Mr. Sen’s team finds content they believe is illegal, they tell social media platforms to take it down, publicize the deception or even ask for criminal charges to filed. Celebrities have become familiar fodder for politically pointed tricks, including Ranveer Singh, a star in Hindi cinema. During a videotaped interview with an Indian news agency at the Ganges River in Varanasi, Mr. Singh praised the powerful prime minister, Narendra Modi, for celebrating “our rich cultural heritage.” But that is not what viewers heard when an altered version of the video, with a voice that sounded like Mr. Singh’s and a nearly perfect lip sync, made the rounds on social media. “We call these lip-sync deepfakes,” said Pamposh Raina, who leads the Deepfakes Analysis Unit, a collective of Indian media houses that opened a tip line on WhatsApp where people can send suspicious videos and audio to be scrutinized. She said the video of Mr. Singh was a typical example of authentic footage edited with an A.I.-cloned voice. The actor filed a complaint with the Mumbai police’s Cyber Crime Unit. In this election, no party has a monopoly on deceptive content. Another manipulated clip opened with authentic footage showing Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Modi’s most prominent opponent, partaking in the mundane ritual of swearing himself in as a candidate. Then it was layered with an A.I.-generated audio track. Mr. Gandhi did not actually resign from his party. This clip contains a personal dig, too, making Mr. Gandhi seem to say that he could “no longer pretend to be Hindu.” Mr. Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, which exit polls on Saturday showed had a comfortable lead, presents itself as a defender of the Hindu faith, and its opponents as traitors or impostors. Sometimes, political deepfakes veer into the supernatural. Dead politicians have a way of coming back to life via uncanny, A.I.-generated likenesses that endorse the real-life campaigns of their descendants. In a video that appeared a few days before voting began in April, a resurrected H. Vasanthakumar, who died of Covid-19 in 2020, spoke indirectly about his own death and blessed his son Vijay, who is running for his father’s former parliamentary seat in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. This apparition followed an example set by two other deceased titans of Tamil politics, Muthuvel Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa Jayaram. Mr. Modi’s government has been framing laws that are supposed to protect Indians from deepfakes and other kinds of misleading content. An “IT Rules” act of 2021 makes online platforms, unlike in the United States, responsible for all kinds of objectionable content, including impersonations intended to cause insult. The Internet Freedom Foundation, an Indian digital rights group, which has argued that these powers are far too broad, is tracking 17 legal challenges to the law. But the prime minister himself seems receptive to some kinds of A.I.-generated content. A pair of videos produced with A.I. tools show two of India’s biggest politicians, Mr. Modi and Mamata Banerjee, one of his staunchest opponents, emulating a viral YouTube video of the American rapper Lil Yachty doing “the HARDEST walk out EVER.” Mr. Modi shared the video on X, saying such creativity was “a delight.” Election officers like Mr. Sen in Karnataka called it political satire: “A Modi rock star is fine and not a violation. People know this is fake.” The police in West Bengal, where Ms. Banerjee is the chief minister, sent notices to some people for posting “offensive, malicious and inciting” content. On the hunt for deepfakes, Mr. Sen said his team in Karnataka, which works for a state government controlled by the opposition, vigilantly scrolls through social media platforms like Instagram and X, searching for keywords and repeatedly refreshing the accounts of popular influencers. The Deepfakes Analysis Unit has 12 fact-checking partners in the media, including a couple that are close to Mr. Modi’s national government. Ms. Raina said her unit works with external forensics labs, too, including one at the University of California, Berkeley. They use A.I.-detection software such as TrueMedia, which scans media files and determines whether they should be trusted. Some tech-savvy engineers are refining A.I.-forensic software to identify which portion of a video was manipulated, all the way down to individual pixels. Pratik Sinha, a founder of Alt News, the most venerable of India’s independent fact-checking sites, said that the possibilities of deepfakes had not yet been fully harnessed. Someday, he said, videos could show politicians not only saying things they did not say but also doing things they did not do. Dr. Hany Farid has been teaching digital forensics at Berkeley for 25 years and collaborates with the Deepfakes Analysis Unit on some cases. He said that while “we’re catching the bad deepfakes,” if more sophisticated fakes entered the arena, they might go undetected. In India as elsewhere, the arms race is on, between deepfakers and fact-checkers — fighting from all sides. Dr. Farid described this as “the first year I would say we have really started to see the impact of A.I. in interesting and more nefarious ways.”",middle highstakes election held mindmelting heat wave blizzard confusing deepfakes blow across india variety seems endless aipowered mimicry ventriloquy deceptive editing effect crude jokey obviously fake could never expected seen real overall effect confounding adding social medium landscape already inundated misinformation volume online detritus far great election commission track let alone debunk diverse bunch vigilante factchecking outfit sprung fill breach wheel law grind slowly unevenly job tracking deepfakes taken hundred government worker private factchecking group based india ready said surya sen forestry officer state karnataka reassigned election manage team people hunting deceptive aigenerated content social medium battleground year mr sen team find content believe illegal tell social medium platform take publicize deception even ask criminal charge filed celebrity become familiar fodder politically pointed trick including ranveer singh star hindi cinema videotaped interview indian news agency ganges river varanasi mr singh praised powerful prime minister narendra modi celebrating rich cultural heritage viewer heard altered version video voice sounded like mr singhs nearly perfect lip sync made round social medium call lipsync deepfakes said pamposh raina lead deepfakes analysis unit collective indian medium house opened tip line whatsapp people send suspicious video audio scrutinized said video mr singh typical example authentic footage edited aicloned voice actor filed complaint mumbai police cyber crime unit election party monopoly deceptive content another manipulated clip opened authentic footage showing rahul gandhi mr modis prominent opponent partaking mundane ritual swearing candidate layered aigenerated audio track mr gandhi actually resign party clip contains personal dig making mr gandhi seem say could longer pretend hindu mr modis governing bharatiya janata party exit poll saturday showed comfortable lead present defender hindu faith opponent traitor impostor sometimes political deepfakes veer supernatural dead politician way coming back life via uncanny aigenerated likeness endorse reallife campaign descendant video appeared day voting began april resurrected h vasanthakumar died covid spoke indirectly death blessed son vijay running father former parliamentary seat southern state tamil nadu apparition followed example set two deceased titan tamil politics muthuvel karunanidhi jayalalithaa jayaram mr modis government framing law supposed protect indian deepfakes kind misleading content rule act make online platform unlike united state responsible kind objectionable content including impersonation intended cause insult internet freedom foundation indian digital right group argued power far broad tracking legal challenge law prime minister seems receptive kind aigenerated content pair video produced ai tool show two india biggest politician mr modi mamata banerjee one staunchest opponent emulating viral youtube video american rapper lil yachty hardest walk ever mr modi shared video x saying creativity delight election officer like mr sen karnataka called political satire modi rock star fine violation people know fake police west bengal m banerjee chief minister sent notice people posting offensive malicious inciting content hunt deepfakes mr sen said team karnataka work state government controlled opposition vigilantly scroll social medium platform like instagram x searching keywords repeatedly refreshing account popular influencers deepfakes analysis unit factchecking partner medium including couple close mr modis national government m raina said unit work external forensics lab including one university california berkeley use aidetection software truemedia scan medium file determines whether trusted techsavvy engineer refining aiforensic software identify portion video manipulated way individual pixel pratik sinha founder alt news venerable india independent factchecking site said possibility deepfakes yet fully harnessed someday said video could show politician saying thing say also thing dr hany farid teaching digital forensics berkeley year collaborates deepfakes analysis unit case said catching bad deepfakes sophisticated fake entered arena might go undetected india elsewhere arm race deepfakers factcheckers fighting side dr farid described first year would say really started see impact ai interesting nefarious way
nytimes,"Birubala Rabha, Who Battled Witch Hunting in India, Dies at 75","May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/world/asia/birubala-rabha-dead.html,"Birubala Rabha, an Indian social activist who fought the practice of branding women as witches in the country’s remote northeast, died on May 13 in Guwahati, the capital of Assam State in that region. She was 75. Her death, in a hospital, was caused by cancer, her assistant, Usha Rabha, said in an interview. (They were not related.) So-called witch hunting has been a scourge throughout India, preying on mostly village women who are often single, widowed or otherwise isolated and involved in property or marital disputes. Accused of being witches, they have been tortured and in many cases murdered; from 2010 to 2021, more than 1,500 were killed in India, according to the country’s National Crime Records Bureau. Ms. Rabha, a slight, bespectacled woman who was born poor in an Assam village, faced down mobs for her work, badgered the police and pushed for legal protection for women. Her efforts were rewarded when legislation outlawing witch hunting was passed in Assam State in 2015. Cases there have dropped sharply, to a few per year from the several a month that were being reported when she began her campaign in the early 2000s, said Usha Rabha, who worked at Mission Birubala, the nongovernmental organization that Birubala Rabha founded. The victims of witch hunts face gruesome punishments, according to “Contemporary Practices of Witch Hunting,” a 2015 report by the Indian legal nonprofit Partners for Law in Development. They can be subjected to “forcible stripping,” the report said, “being paraded naked in public, cutting or tonsuring of the hair, blackening of the face, cutting off of the nose, pulling of the teeth to ‘defang’, gouging out the eye, whipping, gang rape, forcible consumption of human excreta, cow dung” or “killing by hanging, hacking, lynching or burying alive.” Ms. Rabha traveled from village to village in Assam to speak out against the practice and declared that there was no such thing as “daini,” or witches. She had long been suspicious of folk superstitions and of medicine men who chanted incantations over young women to drive out what they believed were evil spirits. As a young mother, Ms. Rabha was told by a local medicine man that her mentally ill son would soon die; he didn’t. That false prediction, in the 1980s, was the seed for her advocacy work, which she began in earnest around 2000. That year, she stood up in a meeting in the village of Lakhipur, also in Assam, to support five women accused of being witches; she didn’t back down when hundreds of villagers surrounded her house the next day. Usha Rabha recalled her first rescue mission with Ms. Rabha, in 2006, when a stick-bearing mob encircled them in a neighboring state. “I was terrified,” she said. But Birubala was “completely unfazed,” Ms. Rabha said. When the police came to rescue the two women, she said, Birubala “reprimanded the cops, saying, ‘I will not stop until I finish the work that I do.’” In Assam, in the 2000s, Birubala Rabha became allied with the state’s former police director general, Kuladhar Saikia. “She would come to me, meet me and discuss these issues,” Mr. Saikia recalled in an interview, adding, “She told me she was standing up against social injustice.” “She was a courageous lady,” he said. “When I was looking for someone to stand up against injustice, they were few. What she accomplished, this village lady, it was quite praiseworthy.” But when she began her campaign, she was quite isolated, as she recalled in a 2016 interview for a New York Times video about her work. “When I started fighting against witch hunts, villagers came in packs to beat me up and kill me,” she told the filmmaker and journalist Vikram Singh, who made the video. “The police did not help us earlier.” She added, “My own relatives called me a witch after my husband died of cancer.” Birubala Rabha was born on Feb. 5, 1949, in the village of Thakurvila, in Assam’s Goalpara district. Her father, Kaliya Rabha, a farmer, died when she was 6. Her mother, Sagarbala Rabha, was a farmworker. Birubala, who had only a grade-school education, married a farmer at 15. She is survived by three sons, Dharmeshwar, Bishnu Prasad and Dayalu, and a daughter, Kumuli Rabha. In 2021, Ms. Rabha was given the Padma Shri, a civilian award, by the Indian government. She was buried with state honors in her village in Goalpara. Over her career, she rescued 90 women both personally and through her organization, Mission Birubala. “Her legacy of scientific principles and progressive societal contributions will serve as a beacon, inspiring future generations to fearlessly combat injustice,” Assam’s minister for public health engineering, Jayanta Mallabaruah, wrote on X. Ms. Rabha had seen too much suffering by women to be impressed by the accolades and awards she received late in her life. “It feels better to save lives than to win awards,” she told Mr. Singh in the 2016 video.",birubala rabha indian social activist fought practice branding woman witch country remote northeast died may guwahati capital assam state region death hospital caused cancer assistant usha rabha said interview related socalled witch hunting scourge throughout india preying mostly village woman often single widowed otherwise isolated involved property marital dispute accused witch tortured many case murdered killed india according country national crime record bureau m rabha slight bespectacled woman born poor assam village faced mob work badgered police pushed legal protection woman effort rewarded legislation outlawing witch hunting passed assam state case dropped sharply per year several month reported began campaign early said usha rabha worked mission birubala nongovernmental organization birubala rabha founded victim witch hunt face gruesome punishment according contemporary practice witch hunting report indian legal nonprofit partner law development subjected forcible stripping report said paraded naked public cutting tonsuring hair blackening face cutting nose pulling teeth defang gouging eye whipping gang rape forcible consumption human excreta cow dung killing hanging hacking lynching burying alive m rabha traveled village village assam speak practice declared thing daini witch long suspicious folk superstition medicine men chanted incantation young woman drive believed evil spirit young mother m rabha told local medicine man mentally ill son would soon die didnt false prediction seed advocacy work began earnest around year stood meeting village lakhipur also assam support five woman accused witch didnt back hundred villager surrounded house next day usha rabha recalled first rescue mission m rabha stickbearing mob encircled neighboring state terrified said birubala completely unfazed m rabha said police came rescue two woman said birubala reprimanded cop saying stop finish work assam birubala rabha became allied state former police director general kuladhar saikia would come meet discus issue mr saikia recalled interview adding told standing social injustice courageous lady said looking someone stand injustice accomplished village lady quite praiseworthy began campaign quite isolated recalled interview new york time video work started fighting witch hunt villager came pack beat kill told filmmaker journalist vikram singh made video police help u earlier added relative called witch husband died cancer birubala rabha born feb village thakurvila assam goalpara district father kaliya rabha farmer died mother sagarbala rabha farmworker birubala gradeschool education married farmer survived three son dharmeshwar bishnu prasad dayalu daughter kumuli rabha m rabha given padma shri civilian award indian government buried state honor village goalpara career rescued woman personally organization mission birubala legacy scientific principle progressive societal contribution serve beacon inspiring future generation fearlessly combat injustice assam minister public health engineering jayanta mallabaruah wrote x m rabha seen much suffering woman impressed accolade award received late life feel better save life win award told mr singh video

Human rights has long been considered a Western concept, but recent scholarship has been uncovering the influence of women from the global south. Women like Hansa Mehta. Mehta stood up against the British government during India’s struggle for independence. She campaigned for women’s social and political equality and their right to an education. And she fought for her ideals during the framing of the constitution for a newly independent India. For Mehta, women’s rights were human rights. This conviction was best exemplified at a 1947 meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, to which she had been appointed as one of just two women delegates, alongside Eleanor Roosevelt. Mehta boldly objected to the wording of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the commission was tasked with framing.",article part overlooked series obituary remarkable people whose death beginning went unreported time human right long considered western concept recent scholarship uncovering influence woman global south woman like hansa mehta mehta stood british government india struggle independence campaigned woman social political equality right education fought ideal framing constitution newly independent india mehta woman right human right conviction best exemplified meeting united nation commission human right appointed one two woman delegate alongside eleanor roosevelt mehta boldly objected wording article universal declaration human right commission tasked framing
nytimes,A Matter of Survival as South Asia’s Heat Wave Reaches 127 Degrees,"May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/world/asia/pakistan-india-heat-wave.html,"As South Asia bakes under a blistering heat wave, life-or-death decisions arrive with the midday sun. Abideen Khan and his 10-year-old son need every penny of the $3.50 a day they can make molding mud into bricks at a kiln under the open sky in Jacobabad, a city in southern Pakistan. But as temperatures have soared as high as 126 degrees Fahrenheit, or 52 degrees Celsius, in recent days, they have been forced to stop by 1 p.m., cutting their earnings in half. “This isn’t heat,” said Mr. Khan, sweat dripping down his face and soaking through his worn clothes. “It’s a punishment, maybe from God.” It is yet another brutal summer in the age of climate change, in a part of the world that is among the most vulnerable to its dire effects. And there is more suffering to come: The extreme heat that Pakistan and neighboring India have been experiencing will continue for days or weeks, forecasters say. Already, it has exacted a deadly toll. In the northern Indian state of Bihar, officials said that at least 14 people had died from the heat. Reports from other states in India’s north indicate that the count could be considerably higher. In both India and Pakistan, hospitals have reported large numbers of heatstroke cases. Ten of those who have died in Bihar were poll workers preparing for the voting to be held in the state on Saturday, the final day of India’s national election. To mitigate the heat, glucose and electrolytes are being distributed to polling officers, tents are being erected to provide shade and earthenware pots will provide cool water. In the state of Uttar Pradesh, at least six election security workers have died. New Delhi, where temperatures have approached 122 this week, nearly 20 degrees above normal, recorded its first official heat-related death of the year on Wednesday. In Jacobabad, long regarded as one of the hottest places on earth, the temperature reached 126 degrees on Sunday, with highs of 124 each of the following three days. About 75 miles away, the Pakistani town of Mohenjo Daro, notable for its Indus Valley civilization sites from 2500 B.C., reached 127 degrees on Sunday, just shy of a record set in 2010. The blazing temperatures compound the challenges for Pakistan, a country of 241 million people that is already grappling with economic and political turmoil. For the more than one million people who live in the Jacobabad district, life is dominated by constant efforts to find ways to cope with the heat. Blackouts lasting 12 to 20 hours a day are common, and some villages lack electricity altogether. The absence of necessities like readily available water and proper housing exacerbates the suffering. Most residents cannot afford air-conditioning or alternatives, like Chinese-made solar power batteries and chargeable fans. A solar panel to run two fans and a lightbulb costs about a month’s wages for laborers in Jacobabad. The water crisis is so severe that donkeys can be seen on the streets carrying tanks, from which residents buy enough water to fill five small plastic jerrycans for $1. Soaring demand has pushed up the price of ice, making this essential commodity even harder to find. Many of the poor have no choice but to work outside. Rice, the lifeblood of Pakistan’s agriculture, demands backbreaking labor in the fields from May to July, the hottest months. For Sahiba, a 25-year-old farmworker who uses one name, each day starts before dawn. She cooks for her family, then walks for miles with other women to reach the fields, where they toil until afternoon under the relentless sun. Nine months pregnant with her 10th child, she carries a double burden. “If we take a day or half-day break, there’s no daily wage, which means my children go hungry that night,” Ms. Sahiba said. Each summer, 25 to 30 percent of the district’s population becomes temporary climate refugees, according to community activists. Some seek refuge in Quetta, a city 185 miles north, where the heat is more bearable. Others go to the port city of Karachi, 310 miles south, which has had its own deadly heat waves but offers some relief with its less frequent blackouts. “Those who can afford it may rent houses in cooler cities, but most residents are simply too poor. They struggle to survive under makeshift tents erected in the open sky,” said Jan Odhano, head of the Community Development Foundation, a Jacobabad-based organization that helps the poor cope with the heat. Jansher Khoso, a 38-year-old garment worker, knows this struggle all too well. In 2018, his mother went to the hospital with heatstroke as temperatures spiked in Jacobabad. Now, every April, he sends his family to Quetta, where they remain until the autumn, while he works in Karachi. But this comes at a steep price. “I work for 16 hours in Karachi to afford the expense of this temporary migration,” Mr. Khoso said, “because I don’t want any of my family members to die in the cruel heat of Jacobabad.” Jacobabad’s suffering has not been limited to high temperatures. In 2022, monsoon rains and devastating floods — linked to erratic weather patterns associated with climate change — submerged the district and about a third of Pakistan overall, killing at least 1,700 people. The heat is nothing new in the city, which was named after John Jacob, a British brigadier general who experienced its harsh climate firsthand in the 19th century. Leading a small force to quell rebel tribes and bandits, General Jacob lost a lieutenant and seven soldiers to the heat on the first day of a 10-mile march. His diary described the wind as “a blast from the furnace” even at night. To cope with the hostile climate, General Jacob introduced an irrigation system and built three canals to supply fresh river water to residents. Today, the canals are dry and full of garbage.",south asia bakes blistering heat wave lifeordeath decision arrive midday sun abideen khan yearold son need every penny day make molding mud brick kiln open sky jacobabad city southern pakistan temperature soared high degree fahrenheit degree celsius recent day forced stop pm cutting earnings half isnt heat said mr khan sweat dripping face soaking worn clothes punishment maybe god yet another brutal summer age climate change part world among vulnerable dire effect suffering come extreme heat pakistan neighboring india experiencing continue day week forecaster say already exacted deadly toll northern indian state bihar official said least people died heat report state india north indicate count could considerably higher india pakistan hospital reported large number heatstroke case ten died bihar poll worker preparing voting held state saturday final day india national election mitigate heat glucose electrolyte distributed polling officer tent erected provide shade earthenware pot provide cool water state uttar pradesh least six election security worker died new delhi temperature approached week nearly degree normal recorded first official heatrelated death year wednesday jacobabad long regarded one hottest place earth temperature reached degree sunday high following three day mile away pakistani town mohenjo daro notable indus valley civilization site bc reached degree sunday shy record set blazing temperature compound challenge pakistan country million people already grappling economic political turmoil one million people live jacobabad district life dominated constant effort find way cope heat blackout lasting hour day common village lack electricity altogether absence necessity like readily available water proper housing exacerbates suffering resident afford airconditioning alternative like chinesemade solar power battery chargeable fan solar panel run two fan lightbulb cost month wage laborer jacobabad water crisis severe donkey seen street carrying tank resident buy enough water fill five small plastic jerrycans soaring demand pushed price ice making essential commodity even harder find many poor choice work outside rice lifeblood pakistan agriculture demand backbreaking labor field may july hottest month sahiba yearold farmworker us one name day start dawn cook family walk mile woman reach field toil afternoon relentless sun nine month pregnant th child carry double burden take day halfday break there daily wage mean child go hungry night m sahiba said summer percent district population becomes temporary climate refugee according community activist seek refuge quetta city mile north heat bearable others go port city karachi mile south deadly heat wave offer relief le frequent blackout afford may rent house cooler city resident simply poor struggle survive makeshift tent erected open sky said jan odhano head community development foundation jacobabadbased organization help poor cope heat jansher khoso yearold garment worker know struggle well mother went hospital heatstroke temperature spiked jacobabad every april sends family quetta remain autumn work karachi come steep price work hour karachi afford expense temporary migration mr khoso said dont want family member die cruel heat jacobabad jacobabads suffering limited high temperature monsoon rain devastating flood linked erratic weather pattern associated climate change submerged district third pakistan overall killing least people heat nothing new city named john jacob british brigadier general experienced harsh climate firsthand th century leading small force quell rebel tribe bandit general jacob lost lieutenant seven soldier heat first day mile march diary described wind blast furnace even night cope hostile climate general jacob introduced irrigation system built three canal supply fresh river water resident today canal dry full garbage
nytimes,"Wall Street Lands on India, Looking for Profits It Can’t Find in China","May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/business/india-foreign-investors.html,"Mumbai, India’s financial capital, has seen a lot of new faces over the past year. The heads of global banks have been trooping through, visiting its stock exchanges, buying property and hiring new staff. A postpandemic boom has pushed the value of India’s stock market to about $5 trillion, putting it neck and neck with Hong Kong’s. India’s economy is among the fastest growing in the world. Wall Street can’t ignore India anymore. The point of entry is Mumbai, a port city of 26 million people, counting its suburbs. Mumbai has been given a makeover: Suspension bridges span its seaways, as well as its infamous slums, and new metro lines have been carved beneath its Art Deco and Indo-Saracenic facades and rumbling commuter railways. Mumbai has been India’s commercial hub for eight decades, but it was relatively unfamiliar to global finance until the past two years. Now North American pension managers, sovereign wealth funds from the Persian Gulf and Singapore, Japanese banks and private equity firms are clamoring for a piece of India’s growth. Old hands and novices alike can rattle off reasons India’s rise is inevitable. Making money will be easier said than done, not least because Indian investors got here first. Compared with Indian companies’ current profits, their stock prices are high. Foreign investors have yet to throw in their full financial weight. Mumbai’s markets were jittery in May, as Narendra Modi, the pro-business prime minister, fought for re-election. He is expected to win, but uncertainties have made far-flung investors feel cautious. Despite all the hot money pouring into the Mumbai markets, India remains a tricky place for foreign companies to navigate, making direct investment risky. Demand for spending by India’s potentially vast base of consumers has been lagging expectations — the top of the income ladder is spending more than ever, while hundreds of millions of people are stuck near the bottom. The simple reason for investors’ enthusiasm is India’s economy, which has strengths other big emerging economies are currently lacking. Foreign clients, an Indian bank executive said, “gravitate to India because it is showing reliable growth, its currency is stable, it’s showing fiscal discipline.” He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he works closely with the government. If India looks better to global investors, China and Russia look worse. China’s miraculous growth engine is sputtering, after three decades at full throttle, with threats of trade wars becoming routine. And Russia was effectively crossed off some lists of viable emerging economies after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the sanctions imposed on it by the United States, Europe and their allies. That is one reason, the banker said, investors pushed Wall Street to make it easier to bet big sums of money on India. The MSCI, an influential stock index of emerging markets started by Morgan Stanley, has increased India’s weighting to more than 18 percent, from 8 percent in 2020, while reducing China’s representation. It’s not just stocks: In June, JPMorgan Chase will add Indian government bonds to its emerging-markets index. Both changes mean that mutual funds are buying more Indian financial assets. Aashish Agarwal, India country head for the investment bank Jefferies, has been doing deals in Mumbai for more than 20 years. He said the case for investing in India was a no-brainer: Indian stocks are outperforming China’s. India’s markets also draw on a wider range of companies than many other emerging economies, he said. “You can’t think of Korea without Samsung, or Latin America without commodities,” Mr. Agarwal said. “India, as an index, is arguably the most balanced you might find outside of the U.S.” The view looks equally sunny to Kevin Carter from Lafayette, Calif. He founded an investment firm, called EMQQ Global, that sells exchange-traded funds, which make it easy for ordinary people to invest in emerging markets. The value of one fund that focuses on India’s internet and e-commerce sectors has grown nearly 40 percent in the past year. India, he said, has the makings of what historically has helped emerging markets to succeed: a large population, especially of young people, and economic growth that is causing people to spend more. With 1.4 billion people and counting, India is the world’s most populous country. Most Indians are working age or will be soon, unlike residents of Europe or East Asia. India’s economic growth rate, which hovered around 7 percent for the past couple of years, has compared favorably with a world average of 3.2 percent. On Friday, on the eve of the election’s last day, India’s central bank delivered a happy surprise. Growth in the most recent quarter was even higher than economists expected, giving the past fiscal year an official rate of 8.2 percent. Still, for some investors, there is an air of déjà vu. They remember a time almost 15 years ago when India was last thought to be ready to overtake China’s rate of economic growth. Those who bought the India hype then ended up disappointed. From 2008 to 2020, China’s per-capita income quadrupled while India’s grew by 2.5 times. That left India poor compared with the rest of the world. The latest calculation by the International Monetary Fund placed India at 138 in national rankings of income, between the Republic of Congo and Nicaragua. China was in 65th place. But India is moving up, a lot faster than China can. Along the way, India is spending heavily on public infrastructure, a hallmark of Mr. Modi’s policies in 10 years in office. In Mumbai itself, there were just three skyscrapers in 2008 — it will have sprouted hundreds by the end of this year. The city’s center of gravity has shifted from its downtown to the purpose-built Bandra Kurla Complex, or BKC, a midtown sprawl of concrete spaghetti. The One BKC tower, home to Bank of America and Switzerland’s insurance giant Swiss Re, as well as many others, was bought by Blackstone, the world’s biggest private-equity group, for a reported $300 million in 2019. Mumbai, of course, is also home to the stock market, which has attracted the savings of India’s own rapidly expanding investor class. Banks have made it easier for middle-income Indian families to invest directly. So many newbie investors have lost money on the risky trading of derivatives — investment securities tied to other securities — that the regulators want to rein them back in. A stiffer test for India’s economy will be whether it can draw more foreign direct investment — the buying up of whole chunks of private businesses by investors or companies. Nivruti Rai, managing director of Invest India, a joint venture between the commerce ministry and private chambers of commerce, is trying to ease the way. Ms. Rai is well positioned for the job, having spent nearly 30 years at Intel, spanning India and America. “I am a woman, I come from tech, from a multinational,” she said, “and I’m based in India. All this sends a message.” More longer-term foreign funding would help strengthen and stabilize the Indian rupee. Investors who make such financial commitments also tend to bring technical expertise. “We may be missing on capital and, in some places, we may be missing on technology,” she said. Ms. Rai has a lofty target — $100 billion in foreign direct investment. That’s higher than what India drew in 2021, which was a record, and much higher than it is now. The inflow sank 16.8 percent last year to just over $28 billion. Foreign investment shrank in many spots around the world in 2023, but India, like China, was hit especially hard. Ms. Rai nonetheless foresees a new cycle of investment activity centered on Indian companies in health care technology, clean energy and artificial intelligence. Mr. Modi has promised a tenfold increase in India’s economy by 2047, in time for the 100th anniversary of its independence. To get there, Ms. Rai noted, the country will need an even faster rate of growth, and that means more of “these investors that we’re trying to draw in.”",mumbai india financial capital seen lot new

nytimes,"Millions of Indians Living Abroad Have a Say in the Election, Even if They Can’t Vote","May 30, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/world/asia/india-election-diaspora-expats.html,"The dishes at a community center potluck for Indian expatriates near Washington, D.C., ranged from chana masala, a popular northern Indian chickpea curry, to idli, a southern Indian rice cake. The guests’ views on India’s general election were equally varied. Some praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic achievements. Supporters of candidates challenging Mr. Modi’s party criticized what they saw as his disregard for minorities and democratic norms. “What is the vision for India in 2024?” the host, Somu Kumar, a manager at a cloud computing company, said recently of that winter potluck. “That gets a lot of people excited to talk.” India’s 35 million-member diaspora, roughly equivalent in population to Delhi’s metropolitan area, represents a tiny minority compared with the nearly one billion people who are eligible to take part in a six-week voting process that ends on Saturday. Expatriate Indians also cannot cast absentee ballots under India’s electoral laws. But the diaspora is heavily courted by India’s main political parties. Many of its members are from the country’s political and business elites, and voters back home want to know what they think. “When a person is abroad, people take interest and believe what they say is right,” said Adapa Prasad, the president of the American branch of Mr. Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The result, he said, is that the 10,000 or so B.J.P. volunteers in the United States alone can reach tens of thousands of voters. This spring, Indians around the world have been hosting gatherings and rallies for their preferred political parties. Many Indians abroad are proud of India’s rise and associate Mr. Modi with it. So much of the recent activity has supported his bid for a third term. In the United States, which the Indian government says is home to more than five million people of Indian origin, there have been pro-Modi rallies at Times Square, the Washington Monument, the Golden Gate Bridge and other landmarks. “Save India,” some of the pro-Modi posters said. Pro-Modi groups have also set up phone banks and held other events. In a Chicago suburb last month, Modi supporters wearing the B.J.P.’s saffron tassels lit a bonfire next to a Hindu school as part of a sacred fire ritual. India’s Hindu majority is a key constituency for Mr. Modi, who has been criticized for normalizing Hindu-nationalist policies in a country born as a secular republic. In Australia, a caravan of cars draped in saffron flags stretched for miles through Sydney in April. In Germany, Modi supporters who own restaurants in Berlin and Munich have been hosting gatherings for B.J.P. supporters, said Arun Varma, an entrepreneur who founded an e-commerce brand there. And in Britain, people have been visiting Hindu temples, as well as mosques and churches, to offer prayers for Mr. Modi’s electoral success, said Neil Lal, the chairman and president of the Indian Council of Scotland and the United Kingdom. “The election is the talk of the town,” Mr. Lal said from London. Mr. Modi has actively cultivated the diaspora’s support over the years, in part by filling stadiums around the world for rallies. A 2020 study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think tank in Washington, found that a majority of Indians abroad supported him over his rivals. Milan Vaishnav, a political scientist at Carnegie who studies India’s diaspora, said that expatriate Indians were a marginal force in Indian politics and that their campaign donations, while difficult to quantify, were small compared with the billions of dollars raised at home. “But gatherings of the diaspora have helped the B.J.P. create an image of global popularity,” he said. The B.J.P. isn’t the only party active outside India. The overseas arm of its main rival, the Indian National Congress, organizes events, distributes campaign posters and helps to place columns in newspapers. The Aam Aadmi Party, which is part of a parliamentary coalition led by the Congress Party, has overseas members who run phone banks and spread friendly memes about its candidates. Mr. Kumar, an Aam Aadmi supporter, said there was growing concern in the diaspora about a potential third Modi term. He said expatriates watching India worry about the recent marginalization of religious minorities, the assassination of a separatist and the jailings of opposition politicians. Some of the people who attend his potlucks, many of whom he plays cricket with, are stalwart Modi backers. Others are onetime Modi supporters who now question whether he should be re-elected. “I hope this also translates back toward India,” Mr. Kumar said. Outside of the main parties, independent activists who live abroad have criticized the government in ways that would be difficult in India, where Mr. Modi’s government has cracked down on dissent and jailed opposition leaders. One of those activists, Suresh Ediga, an Indian expatriate in New Jersey, organizes meetings on election reform and runs a blog that fact checks Indian politicians. “Independent institutions have collapsed under Modi,” he said. “That is more alarming than anything else.” While many in the diaspora have thrown themselves into campaigning, others have taken a more hands-off approach. Lion Hina Trivedi, a prominent social worker from Gujarat, the Indian state where Mr. Modi served as chief minister from 2001 to 2014, has known him for decades and met him on his trips to Washington. She said that after more than 45 years in Chicago, she was now more invested in her American community. But she still urges the Indians she knows to travel back home to vote, recalling her father’s advice: “Never forget about India.” “You should go,” she tells them. “Your voice matters.”",dish community center potluck indian expatriate near washington dc ranged chana masala popular northern indian chickpea curry idli southern indian rice cake guest view india general election equally varied praised prime minister narendra modis economic achievement supporter candidate challenging mr modis party criticized saw disregard minority democratic norm vision india host somu kumar manager cloud computing company said recently winter potluck get lot people excited talk india millionmember diaspora roughly equivalent population delhi metropolitan area represents tiny minority compared nearly one billion people eligible take part sixweek voting process end saturday expatriate indian also cast absentee ballot india electoral law diaspora heavily courted india main political party many member country political business elite voter back home want know think person abroad people take interest believe say right said adapa prasad president american branch mr modis ruling bharatiya janata party result said bjp volunteer united state alone reach ten thousand voter spring indian around world hosting gathering rally preferred political party many indian abroad proud india rise associate mr modi much recent activity supported bid third term united state indian government say home five million people indian origin promodi rally time square washington monument golden gate bridge landmark save india promodi poster said promodi group also set phone bank held event chicago suburb last month modi supporter wearing bjps saffron tassel lit bonfire next hindu school part sacred fire ritual india hindu majority key constituency mr modi criticized normalizing hindunationalist policy country born secular republic australia caravan car draped saffron flag stretched mile sydney april germany modi supporter restaurant berlin munich hosting gathering bjp supporter said arun varma entrepreneur founded ecommerce brand britain people visiting hindu temple well mosque church offer prayer mr modis electoral success said neil lal chairman president indian council scotland united kingdom election talk town mr lal said london mr modi actively cultivated diaspora support year part filling stadium around world rally study carnegie endowment international peace think tank washington found majority indian abroad supported rival milan vaishnav political scientist carnegie study india diaspora said expatriate indian marginal force indian politics campaign donation difficult quantify small compared billion dollar raised home gathering diaspora helped bjp create image global popularity said bjp isnt party active outside india overseas arm main rival indian national congress organizes event distributes campaign poster help place column newspaper aam aadmi party part parliamentary coalition led congress party overseas member run phone bank spread friendly meme candidate mr kumar aam aadmi supporter said growing concern diaspora potential third modi term said expatriate watching india worry recent marginalization religious minority assassination separatist jailings opposition politician people attend potluck many play cricket stalwart modi backer others onetime modi supporter question whether reelected hope also translates back toward india mr kumar said outside main party independent activist live abroad criticized government way would difficult india mr modis government cracked dissent jailed opposition leader one activist suresh ediga indian expatriate new jersey organizes meeting election reform run blog fact check indian politician independent institution collapsed modi said alarming anything else many diaspora thrown campaigning others taken handsoff approach lion hina trivedi prominent social worker gujarat indian state mr modi served chief minister known decade met trip washington said year chicago invested american community still urge indian know travel back home vote recalling father advice never forget india go tell voice matter
nytimes,New Delhi Sweats Through Its Hottest Recorded Day,"May 29, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/world/asia/india-delhi-hottest-day-ever.html,"New Delhi recorded its highest temperature ever measured on Wednesday — 126 degrees Fahrenheit, or 52.3 degrees Celsius — leaving residents of the Indian capital sweltering in a heat wave that has kept temperatures in several Indian states well above 110 degrees for weeks. In New Delhi, where walking out of the house felt like walking into an oven, officials feared that the electricity grid was being overwhelmed and that the city’s water supply might need rationing. The past 12 months have been the planet’s hottest ever recorded, and cities like Miami are experiencing extreme heat even before the arrival of summer. Scientists said this week that the average person on Earth had experienced 26 more days of abnormally high temperatures in the past year than would have been the case without human-induced climate change. Extreme heat can cause serious health issues and can be fatal. Although late-afternoon dust storms and light drizzle in New Delhi had brought hope of some reprieve on Wednesday, the weather station at Mungeshpur, northwest of the capital, reported a recording of 126 degrees around 2:30 p.m. Dr. Kuldeep Srivastava, a scientist at the regional meteorological center in Delhi, said it was the highest temperature ever recorded by the automatic weather monitoring system, which was installed in 2010. In a statement later on Wednesday evening, India’s meteorological department said the Mungeshpur station was “an outlier compared to other stations.” It said it was assessing whether that station’s recording of a higher temperature than other stations around Delhi was due to an error or a local mitigating factor. The previous record for the highest temperature, around 48 degrees Celsius — about 118.5 Fahrenheit — was repeatedly crossed in recent days. Three of New Delhi’s weather stations reported temperatures of 49.8 degree Celsius — 121.8 degrees Fahrenheit — or higher on Tuesday, setting a new record even before the 52.3 degree reading on Wednesday afternoon. For weeks now, temperatures in several states in India’s north have reached well over 110 degrees, and hospitals have been reporting an uptick in cases of heatstroke. In the Himalayan states, hundreds of forest fires have been reported. Deadly fires in crowded buildings are regular occurrences in India, with many of them caused by short circuits. The rising temperatures have increased concerns about the risks. Atul Garg, Delhi’s fire chief, said daily fire-related calls have crossed 200, the highest in the past decade. “Normally during this period in the last eight to 10 years we would receive 160 calls per day,” Mr. Garg said. “We are stretched in terms of manpower.” The heat wave has coincided with campaigning for India’s general election, with the last phase of voting set to take place on June 1. Candidates, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and opposition leaders, have continued holding large public rallies, despite the temperatures. Nitin Gadkari, a cabinet minister who is running for re-election, fainted from the heat while addressing a rally, and on Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi, the opposition leader, took a break during a speech to pour water from a bottle onto his head. “It’s quite hot, no?” he said. To help conserve water amid the extreme heat, Atishi Marlena, Delhi’s water minister, announced the deployment of 200 teams to crack down on waste and misuse. Fines will be imposed for activities such as washing cars with hoses, “overflow of water tanks” and “use of domestic water for construction or commercial” purposes, she said. Delhi’s lieutenant governor, V.K. Saxena, ordered measures to protect construction workers during the midday heat, and for water to be provided at bus stands. The state broadcaster reported that Mr. Saxena, who was appointed by Mr. Modi, had also called for construction workers to get “paid leave” between noon and 3 p.m. But it did not say how that would be implemented, particularly at a moment when the capital region’s administration is paralyzed by infighting between its lieutenant governor and the elected chief minister. Just how much the heat has affected daily life in the Indian capital was captured in the adjournment order of a consumer dispute court last week when the most intense period of the heat wave began. The presiding official, Suresh Kumar Gupta, complained that the room had no air-conditioning, and the water supply in the bathrooms was also affected. “There is too much heat in the courtroom, which led to sweating, as such it is difficult to hear arguments,” he said in the order. “In these circumstances, arguments cannot be heard, so case is adjourned.” Jitender Singh, 42, an auto rickshaw driver in the eastern part of the city, said that business was down by about a third because people were avoiding leaving their homes. He said he and his colleagues had frequently fallen sick. “But we must come on the road to support our families,” he added.",new delhi recorded highest temperature ever measured wednesday degree fahrenheit degree celsius leaving resident indian capital sweltering heat wave kept temperature several indian state well degree week new delhi walking house felt like walking oven official feared electricity grid overwhelmed city water supply might need rationing past month planet hottest ever recorded city like miami experiencing extreme heat even arrival summer scientist said week average person earth experienced day abnormally high temperature past year would case without humaninduced climate change extreme heat cause serious health issue fatal although lateafternoon dust storm light drizzle new delhi brought hope reprieve wednesday weather station mungeshpur northwest capital reported recording degree around pm dr kuldeep srivastava scientist regional meteorological center delhi said highest temperature ever recorded automatic weather monitoring system installed statement later wednesday evening india meteorological department said mungeshpur station outlier compared station said assessing whether station recording higher temperature station around delhi due error local mitigating factor previous record highest temperature around degree celsius fahrenheit repeatedly crossed recent day three new delhi weather station reported temperature degree celsius degree fahrenheit higher tuesday setting new record even degree reading wednesday afternoon week temperature several state india north reached well degree hospital reporting uptick case heatstroke himalayan state hundred forest fire reported deadly fire crowded building regular occurrence india many caused short circuit rising temperature increased concern risk atul garg delhi fire chief said daily firerelated call crossed highest past decade normally period last eight year would receive call per day mr garg said stretched term manpower heat wave coincided campaigning india general election last phase voting set take place june candidate including prime minister narendra modi opposition leader continued holding large public rally despite temperature nitin gadkari cabinet minister running reelection fainted heat addressing rally tuesday rahul gandhi opposition leader took break speech pour water bottle onto head quite hot said help conserve water amid extreme heat atishi marlena delhi water minister announced deployment team crack waste misuse fine imposed activity washing car hose overflow water tank use domestic water construction commercial purpose said delhi lieutenant governor vk saxena ordered measure protect construction worker midday heat water provided bus stand state broadcaster reported mr saxena appointed mr modi also called construction worker get paid leave noon pm say would implemented particularly moment capital region administration paralyzed infighting lieutenant governor elected chief minister much heat affected daily life indian capital captured adjournment order consumer dispute court last week intense period heat wave began presiding official suresh kumar gupta complained room airconditioning water supply bathroom also affected much heat courtroom led sweating difficult hear argument said order circumstance argument heard case adjourned jitender singh auto rickshaw driver eastern part city said business third people avoiding leaving home said colleague frequently fallen sick must come road support family added

Remal, con vientos de más de 110 kilómetros por hora, dejó un rastro de destrucción, arrancando árboles y dañando el tendido eléctrico en toda la región, según las autoridades. La tormenta mató a 13 personas en Bangladés y dañó o destruyó más de 35.000 viviendas en las zonas costeras, afectando a unos 3,5 millones de personas, según las autoridades. Más de 13 millones de personas se quedaron sin electricidad el lunes por la noche, según funcionarios del Ministerio de Energía. El país del sur de Asia tiene 170 millones de habitantes. La tormenta también causó cortes de electricidad y daños en viviendas del estado indio de Bengala Occidental. El martes, las autoridades dijeron que al menos 10 personas habían muerto, y varias más estaban desaparecidas, después de que las fuertes lluvias de los remanentes del ciclón provocaran el derrumbe de una cantera en el estado indio del sur de Mizorán, vecino de Bangladés. La tormenta llegó tras semanas de intenso calor en la región, con temperaturas que alcanzaron los 40 grados centígrados. Remal tocó tierra cerca de Mongla, el puerto del sur de Bangladés, y de las vecinas islas Sagar, de India, hacia las 9 p. m. del domingo. Alrededor de un millón de personas fueron evacuadas de los pueblos costeros de Bangladés antes de que llegara la tormenta. La mayoría de esas aldeas quedaron inundadas, dejando a millones de personas vulnerables, según las autoridades. “Mientras el ciclón Remal azota las zonas costeras de Bangladés, más de 8,4 millones de personas, entre ellas 3,2 millones de niños, corren graves riesgos en materia de salud, nutrición, saneamiento y seguridad”, declaró en un comunicado Sheldon Yett, representante de UNICEF en Bangladés. La capital de Bangladés, Daca, en el interior del país, se vio afectada por lluvias torrenciales y fuertes vientos. La tormenta interrumpió los vuelos en el aeropuerto internacional Shah Amanat, en el sureste de Bangladés, y en el aeropuerto de Calcuta, en India. El martes, la tormenta se había debilitado, pero los meteorólogos de Bangladés e India advirtieron de que las lluvias torrenciales y los fuertes vientos podrían continuar durante unos días. Bangladés ha sufrido varias tormentas violentas en los últimos años. El pasado mes de mayo, un fuerte ciclón, Mocha, azotó Bangladés y Birmania y dejó varios muertos. La tormenta causó daños generalizados en los extensos campos de refugiados rohinyás de Cox’s Bazar, destruyendo más de 3000 cabañas y centros de aprendizaje construidos con tablillas de bambú y lonas de plástico. En Filipinas también se ha producido la primera tormenta tropical de la temporada. El tifón Ewiniar azotó el país isleño en la madrugada del sábado. La Oficina de Defensa Civil informó el lunes de que la tormenta había causado siete bajas.

Remal, which had measured winds of over 70 miles per hour, left a trail of destruction, uprooting trees and damaging power lines throughout the region, officials said. The storm killed 13 people in Bangladesh, and it damaged or destroyed more than 35,000 homes across the coastal areas, affecting about 3.5 million people, according to officials. More than 13 million people there lost electricity on Monday evening, according to power ministry officials. The South Asian country has a population of 170 million. The storm also caused power outages and damaged homes in the Indian state of West Bengal. On Tuesday, officials said that at least 10 people were killed, with several more missing, after heavy rains from the remnants of the cyclone caused a stone quarry to collapse in the northeastern Indian state of Mizoram, which neighbors Bangladesh. The storm hit after weeks of intense heat in the region, with temperatures reaching about 104 Fahrenheit, or 40 Celsius. Remal made landfall near Bangladesh’s southern port of Mongla and the neighboring Sagar Islands of India around 9 p.m. on Sunday. Around a million people were evacuated from Bangladesh’s coastal villages before the storm hit. Most of those villages were flooded, leaving millions of people vulnerable, officials said. “As Cyclone Remal hits the coastal areas of Bangladesh, over 8.4 million people, including 3.2 million children, are at high health, nutrition, sanitation and safety risks,” Sheldon Yett, a UNICEF representative to Bangladesh, said in a statement. Bangladesh’s inland capital, Dhaka was hit with heavy rain and strong winds. The storm disrupted flights at Shah Amanat International Airport in southeastern Bangladesh and at Kolkata Airport in India. By Tuesday, the storm had weakened, but meteorologists in Bangladesh and India warned that heavy rain and strong winds could continue for a few days. Bangladesh has been hit with several violent storms in recent years. Last May, a severe cyclone, Mocha, hit Bangladesh and Myanmar and left several people dead. The storm caused widespread damage in the sprawling Rohingya refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, destroying over 3,000 shanties and learning centers made of bamboo slats and plastic tarpaulin. The Philippines has also seen its first tropical storm of the season. Typhoon Ewiniar hit the island nation early Saturday morning. The Office of Civil Defense reported Monday that there were seven casualties from the storm. The storm had gusts of over 40 miles per hour, according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration.",least people killed million left without power cyclone remal first tropical storm season hit bangladesh neighboring eastern india sunday remal measured wind mile per hour left trail destruction uprooting tree damaging power line throughout region official said storm killed people bangladesh damaged destroyed home across coastal area affecting million people according official million people lost electricity monday evening according power ministry official south asian country population million storm also caused power outage damaged home indian state west bengal tuesday official said least people killed several missing heavy rain remnant cyclone caused stone quarry collapse northeastern indian state mizoram neighbor bangladesh storm hit week intense heat region temperature reaching fahrenheit celsius remal made landfall near bangladesh southern port mongla neighboring sagar island india around pm sunday around million people evacuated bangladesh coastal village storm hit village flooded leaving million people vulnerable official said cyclone remal hit coastal area bangladesh million people including million child high health nutrition sanitation safety risk sheldon yett unicef representative bangladesh said statement bangladesh inland capital dhaka hit heavy rain strong wind storm disrupted flight shah amanat international airport southeastern bangladesh kolkata airport india tuesday storm weakened meteorologist bangladesh india warned heavy rain strong wind could continue day bangladesh hit several violent storm recent year last may severe cyclone mocha hit bangladesh myanmar left several people dead storm caused widespread damage sprawling rohingya refugee camp cox bazar destroying shanty learning center made bamboo slat plastic tarpaulin philippine also seen first tropical storm season typhoon ewiniar hit island nation early saturday morning office civil defense reported monday seven casualty storm storm gust mile per hour according philippine atmospheric geophysical astronomical service administration
nytimes,"Leaflet by Leaflet, a Few Aging Activists Fight India’s Tide of Bigotry","May 28, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/world/asia/india-activists.html,"One recent morning, Roop Rekha Verma, an 80-year-old peace activist and former university leader, walked through a north Indian neighborhood prone to sectarian strife and parked herself near a tea shop. From her sling bag, she pulled out a bundle of pamphlets bearing messages of religious tolerance and mutual coexistence and began handing them to passers-by. “Talk to each other. Don’t let anyone divide you,” one read in Hindi. Spreading those simple words is an act of bravery in today’s India. Ms. Verma and others like her are waging a lonely battle against a tide of hatred and bigotry increasingly normalized by India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his deputies have vilified the country’s minorities in a yearslong campaign that has escalated during the current national election, the small band of aging activists has built bridges and preached harmony between religious groups. They have continued to hit the pavement even as the price for dissent and free speech has become high, trying to keep the flame alive for the nonsectarian ideal embedded in India’s constitution and in their own memories. More than three dozen human rights defenders, poets, journalists and opposition politicians face charges, including under antiterrorism laws, for criticizing Mr. Modi’s divisive policies, according to rights groups. (The government has said little about the charges, other than repeating its line that the law takes its own course.) The crackdown has had a chilling effect on many Indians. “That is where the role of these civil society activists becomes more important,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, a deputy director at Human Rights Watch. “Despite a crackdown, they are refusing to cow down, leading them to hold placards, distributing fliers, to revive a message that once was taken for granted.” The use of posters and pamphlets to raise public awareness is a time-tested practice among Indian activists. Revolutionaries fighting for independence from British colonizers employed them to drum up support and mobilize ordinary Indians. Today, village leaders use them to spread awareness about health and other government programs. Such old-school outreach may seem quixotic in the digital age. Every day, India’s social media spaces, reaching hundreds of millions of people, are inundated with anti-Muslim vitriol promoted by the B.J.P. and its associated right-wing organizations. During the national election that ends next week, Mr. Modi and his party have targeted Muslims directly, by name, with brazen attacks both online and in campaign speeches. (The B.J.P. rejects accusations that it discriminates against Muslims, noting that government welfare programs under its supervision assist all Indians equally.) Those who have worked in places torn apart by sectarian violence say polarization can be combated only by going to people on the streets and making them understand its dangers. Merely showing up can help. For Ms. Verma, the seeds of her activism were planted during her childhood, when she listened to horror stories of the sectarian violence that left hundreds of thousands dead during the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947. Later, as a university philosophy professor, she fought caste discrimination and religious divides both inside and outside the classroom. She opposed patriarchal attitudes even as slurs were thrown at her. In the early 1980s, when she noticed that the names of mothers were excluded from student admission forms, she pressed for their inclusion and won. But more than anything else, it was the campaign to build a major Hindu temple in the town of Ayodhya in her home state of Uttar Pradesh that gave Ms. Verma’s life a new meaning. In 1992, a Hindu mob demolished a centuries-old mosque there, claiming that the site had previously held a Hindu temple. Deadly riots followed. This past January, three decades later, the Ayodhya temple opened, inaugurated by Mr. Modi. It was a significant victory for a Hindu nationalist movement whose maligning and marginalizing of Muslims is exactly what Ms. Verma has devoted herself to opposing. The Hindu majority, she said, has a responsibility to protect minorities, “not become complicit in their demonization.” While the government’s incitement of religious enmity is new in India, the sectarian divisions themselves are not. One activist, Vipin Kumar Tripathi, 76, a former physics professor at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi, said he had started gathering students after classes and educating them about the dangers of “religious radicalization” in the early 1990s. Today, Mr. Tripathi travels to different parts of India with a message of peace. Recently, he stood in a corner of a busy train station in northeastern New Delhi. As office workers, students and laborers ran toward platforms, he handed information sheets and brochures to anyone who extended a hand. His materials addressed some of the most provocative issues in India: the troubles in Kashmir, where the Modi government has rescinded the majority-Muslim region’s semi-autonomy; the politics over the Ayodhya temple; and ordinary citizens’ rights to question their government. “To respect God and to pretend to do that for votes are two different things,” read one of his handouts. At the station, Anirudh Saxena, a tall man in his early 30s with a pencil mustache, stopped and looked Mr. Tripathi straight in the eyes. “Sir, why are you doing this every week?” Mr. Saxena asked. “Read this,” Mr. Tripathi told Mr. Saxena, handing him a small 10-page booklet. “This explains why we should read books and understand history instead of reading WhatsApp garbage and extracting pleasure out of someone’s pain.” Mr. Saxena smiled, nodded his head and put the booklet in his handbag before disappearing into the crowd. If just 10 out of a thousand people read his materials, Mr. Tripathi said, his job is done. “When truth becomes the casualty, you can only fight it on the streets,” he said. Shabnam Hashmi, 66, another activist based in New Delhi, said she had helped distribute about four million pamphlets in the state of Gujarat after sectarian riots there in 2002. More than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, died in the communal violence, which happened under the watch of Mr. Modi, who was the state’s top leader at the time. During that period, she and her colleagues were harassed by right-wing activists, who threw stones at her and filed police complaints. In 2016, months after Mr. Modi became prime minister, the government prohibited foreign funding for her organization. She has continued her street activism nonetheless. “It is the most effective way of reaching the people directly,” she said. “What it does is, it somehow gives people courage to fight fear and keep resisting.” “We might not be able to stop this craziness,” she added, “but that doesn’t mean we should stop fighting.” Even before Mr. Modi’s rise, said Ms. Verma, the activist in Uttar Pradesh, governments never “showered roses” on her when she was doing things like leading marches and bringing together warring factions after flare-ups of religious violence. Over the decades, she has been threatened with prison and bundled into police vehicles. “But it was never so bad,” she said, as it has now become under Mr. Modi. The space for activism may completely vanish, Ms. Verma said, as his party becomes increasingly intolerant of any scrutiny. For now, she said, activists “are, sadly, just giving proof of our existence: that we may be demoralized, but we are still alive. Otherwise, hatred has seeped so deep it will take decades to rebuild trust.”",one recent morning roop rekha verma yearold peace activist former university leader walked north indian neighborhood prone

nytimes,Two Deadly Fires in Rapid Succession Expose India’s Gaps in Safety,"May 26, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/world/asia/india-fire-death-infants-safety.html,"Seven newborn babies lost their lives after their New Delhi neonatal clinic was engulfed in flames. What remained of the two-story building on Sunday morning was its burned facade, a charred spiral staircase and oxygen cylinders covered in soot. Hours earlier, in the western Indian city of Rajkot, an amusement park of trampolines and bowling lanes had turned to an inferno. The families of people who had come to enjoy a discounted offer of all-you-can-play to celebrate the start of summer vacation were left trying to identify bodies among the at least 27 dead, many of them children too charred to be recognizable. As after every such deadly episode, political leaders were quick with messages of condolence, announcements of arrests, creations of inquiries — and finger-pointing. But to analysts and experts who had warned for years about India’s abysmal fire preparedness, the back-to-back disasters on Saturday were the latest reminder that systemic change to make the country safer was still missing. Building safety compliance remains abysmal across India, the world’s most populous nation. The fire services have long faced huge gaps in the numbers of stations, personnel and equipment. Government audits after mass-casualty disasters unearth glaring shortcomings, with little follow-up. Though the number has gone down over the past decade, more than 20 fire-related deaths occur every day in India, according to government statistics. Many of the fires — particularly in crowded urban centers — are caused by short circuits, an alarming prospect as India faces an intense period of heat waves that strains electrical wires. R.C. Sharma, a former fire service chief in Delhi, said that one major problem is that fire regulations go unenforced. Another is that fire-response resources have failed to keep up with urbanization that is happening rapidly and often without regard to safety. “We are not in a good condition,” Mr. Sharma said. “In other countries, you have fire hydrants and everything at all the places. But in India, we don’t even have drinking water around the clock, so we do not think of having firefighting water around the clock.” Data provided to the Indian Parliament in 2019 by the country’s Home Ministry painted a dire state of preparedness, with major deficiencies. India had only 3,377 fire stations when regulations called for 8,559. The shortfall in personnel and equipment was even worse. The fire service had about 55,000 people, when a half-million were called for, and 7,300 vehicles, when it should have had 33,000. It is unclear how much of those gaps have been filled in the five years since. A new $600 million program for expansion and modernization of the fire service announced by India’s central government last year, with additional resources to be pooled from the states, suggests a lot of it remains undone. Government audits have repeatedly flagged the vulnerability of public buildings, particularly hospitals. A study last year of hospitals across India where there had been a fire in the past decade showed that half were not legally compliant on safety measures. Private and public hospitals were about equally bad. Short circuits were the cause of the fires in nearly 90 percent of the episodes. In one state, after a fire killed 10 babies in a neonatal care unit, assessments found that more than 80 percent of the state’s hospitals had never carried out fire safety audits; half had never conducted fire drills; and only a few had fire safety certificates. “The tendency is to comply in letter, not spirit,” said S.A. Abbasi, an emeritus professor at Pondicherry University, who was the lead author of the report. “Lapses and laxity continue to be the norms rather than exceptions.” What caused the fire at the amusement park in Rajkot, in the state of Gujarat, was not known. But the initial police complaint, a copy of which was seen by The New York Times, made clear that the facility lacked both a clearance certificate from the fire department and effective equipment and protocols in case of fire. Ilesh Kher, Rajkot’s chief fire officer, said the fire at the facility had started just before 6 p.m., and the flames were contained in a little over an hour. He did not know how many people were present when the blaze broke out, but witness accounts in local news suggested over 100. The building appeared to be a temporary structure made of iron poles and metal sheets. Daksh Kujadia, a teenager who had gone bowling with a cousin, said the fire had started under an emergency exit. About 30 people became trapped in the bowling lanes. “We didn’t have an option but to tear the metal sheet in a corner,” he told local news media. “Fifteen of us got out by jumping from there.” The two-story Delhi neonatal hospital that caught fire just before midnight was operating out of a residential building. Neighbors described frequent disputes, as trucks often blocked the road outside the hospital to unload large cylinders of oxygen. “A few of us climbed on top of each other and climbed into the building from the back side,” said Ravi Gupta, who lives in the area and helped evacuate a dozen babies from the back of the building as the front caught fire and multiple explosions were heard as oxygen cylinders burst. “We brought ladders and bedsheets from our houses. I carried infants in my hands from the fire and brought them down.” Health care in Delhi, India’s capital, has in recent years has been caught in a messy political fight between the central government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Delhi’s elected local government, run by a smaller opposition party, the Aam Aadmi Party, or A.A.P. The local administration has accused Mr. Modi of using his control over government officials to handicap its efforts. Accusations continued to fly after Saturday’s deadly hospital fire. Pankaj Luthra, a local official affiliated with Modi’s party in the neighborhood where the hospital is, blamed the A.A.P. for giving the hospital its license. There had been, he said, complaints of illegal oxygen cylinder refilling at the hospital. Saurabh Bhardwaj, A.A.P.’s health minister for Delhi, released a statement complaining that the most senior official in Delhi’s health department — a civil servant technically supervised by Mr. Bhardwaj, but in fact answering to the central government — was ignoring his calls and messages. “I got to know about this incident through a media flash,” Mr. Bhardwaj said.",seven newborn baby lost life new delhi neonatal clinic engulfed flame remained twostory building sunday morning burned facade charred spiral staircase oxygen cylinder covered soot hour earlier western indian city rajkot amusement park trampoline bowling lane turned inferno family people come enjoy discounted offer allyoucanplay celebrate start summer vacation left trying identify body among least dead many child charred recognizable every deadly episode political leader quick message condolence announcement arrest creation inquiry fingerpointing analyst expert warned year india abysmal fire preparedness backtoback disaster saturday latest reminder systemic change make country safer still missing building safety compliance remains abysmal across india world populous nation fire service long faced huge gap number station personnel equipment government audit masscasualty disaster unearth glaring shortcoming little followup though number gone past decade firerelated death occur every day india according government statistic many fire particularly crowded urban center caused short circuit alarming prospect india face intense period heat wave strain electrical wire rc sharma former fire service chief delhi said one major problem fire regulation go unenforced another fireresponse resource failed keep urbanization happening rapidly often without regard safety good condition mr sharma said country fire hydrant everything place india dont even drinking water around clock think firefighting water around clock data provided indian parliament country home ministry painted dire state preparedness major deficiency india fire station regulation called shortfall personnel equipment even worse fire service people halfmillion called vehicle unclear much gap filled five year since new million program expansion modernization fire service announced india central government last year additional resource pooled state suggests lot remains undone government audit repeatedly flagged vulnerability public building particularly hospital study last year hospital across india fire past decade showed half legally compliant safety measure private public hospital equally bad short circuit cause fire nearly percent episode one state fire killed baby neonatal care unit assessment found percent state hospital never carried fire safety audit half never conducted fire drill fire safety certificate tendency comply letter spirit said sa abbasi emeritus professor pondicherry university lead author report lapse laxity continue norm rather exception caused fire amusement park rajkot state gujarat known initial police complaint copy seen new york time made clear facility lacked clearance certificate fire department effective equipment protocol case fire ilesh kher rajkots chief fire officer said fire facility started pm flame contained little hour know many people present blaze broke witness account local news suggested building appeared temporary structure made iron pole metal sheet daksh kujadia teenager gone bowling cousin said fire started emergency exit people became trapped bowling lane didnt option tear metal sheet corner told local news medium fifteen u got jumping twostory delhi neonatal hospital caught fire midnight operating residential building neighbor described frequent dispute truck often blocked road outside hospital unload large cylinder oxygen u climbed top climbed building back side said ravi gupta life area helped evacuate dozen baby back building front caught fire multiple explosion heard oxygen cylinder burst brought ladder bedsheets house carried infant hand fire brought health care delhi india capital recent year caught messy political fight central government prime minister narendra modi delhi elected local government run smaller opposition party aam aadmi party aap local administration accused mr modi using control government official handicap effort accusation continued fly saturday deadly hospital fire pankaj luthra local official affiliated modis party neighborhood hospital blamed aap giving hospital license said complaint illegal oxygen cylinder refilling hospital saurabh bhardwaj aaps health minister delhi released statement complaining senior official delhi health department civil servant technically supervised mr bhardwaj fact answering central government ignoring call message got know incident medium flash mr bhardwaj said
nytimes,"I’m an Indian Muslim, and I’m Scared to Say So","May 26, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/opinion/india-muslim-modi-election.html,"I used to answer the phone with “Salam.” Not anymore. I don’t want people to know I’m a Muslim. There is little that would identify me as Muslim to begin with, aside from my name. I don’t wear a skullcap, and in public I avoid wearing the loosefitting Pathani kurta and peppering my speech with Urdu words, all of which are identity markers for Indian Muslims. But in the India of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you can’t take any chances. For 10 years, Mr. Modi’s Hindu-chauvinist government has vilified the nation’s 200 million Muslims as dangerous undesirables. Recently, he took that rhetoric to a new low during the six weeks of voting in India’s national elections — which are widely expected to win him a third consecutive five-year term — directly referring to Muslims as “infiltrators” in a country that he and his followers seek to turn into a pure Hindu state. As offensive as that was, it is sadly familiar to Indian Muslims like me who — after a decade of denigration, violence and murder — live in daily fear of being identified and attacked, forcing us into self-denial to protect ourselves. India is home to one of the world’s largest Muslim populations. Islam came here around 1,300 years ago, and Indian Muslims descend from natives of this land who converted to Islam centuries ago. Many Indian Muslims fought against British colonization, and millions rejected the 1947 partition of the country into a predominantly Hindu India and a mostly Muslim Pakistan. India is our home, and people like me are proud patriots. But Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalism has made us the targets in what might be the largest radicalization of people on the planet. Its seeds were planted with the founding in 1925 of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing Hindu organization that sought the establishment of a fully Hindu state in India and was inspired by the European fascism of that era. When Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party — a political offshoot of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh — won elections in 2014 and he became prime minister, he and his followers saw it as the civilizational moment that Hindus had been waiting for. Mr. Modi was the god-king who would free Hindu civilization from centuries of domination, first by a series of Muslim rulers culminating with the Mughal empire that ruled India for around three centuries and then by the British colonizers who followed. Islamophobia isn’t new to India, and Muslims also faced prejudice and recurring violence during the generations in which the liberal upper-caste Hindu elite dominated the nation’s secular democratic politics. But under Mr. Modi’s right-wing leadership, hatred of Muslims has effectively become state policy. India is now a country where police have been accused of standing by as Hindus attack Muslims, where the killers of religious minorities go unpunished and where Hindu extremists openly call for the genocide of Muslims. Protest, and you run the risk of having a Hindu mob unleashed on you. That’s what happened after Mr. Modi’s government in 2019 pushed through a citizenship law that discriminates against Muslims and his party promised to expel “infiltrators” from the country. When Indian Muslims protested, one of Mr. Modi’s supporters responded with a provocative speech that is blamed for sparking deadly clashes between Hindus and Muslims in Delhi in February 2020. Police were accused of looking the other way as Muslims had their shops destroyed, were assaulted and were even killed. Bulldozers have become a symbol of this state terrorism — rolled out at right-wing rallies, tattooed on the arms of Modi supporters and featured in Hindu nationalist songs — because of their use in areas governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party to illegally knock down the homes and businesses of Muslims who dare to speak up. Some states have essentially made Muslim-Hindu relationships illegal, based on an absurd Hindu conspiracy theory that Muslim men are seducing Hindu women as part of a long-term plan to turn India into a Muslim nation. The liberal Hindu elite, instead of acknowledging its role in enabling the sentiments on which Mr. Modi has capitalized, has done little to help, other than to ineffectually express nostalgia for a lost Hindu tolerance. And there is little that Indian Muslims can do within the political system: Although the Muslim share of India’s population has slowly grown to 14 percent, the percentage of Parliament members who are Muslim has declined to less than 5 percent today, compared with 9 percent in the early 1980s. The Indian Muslim response to our subjugation has largely been a deafening silence. Many of us are simply unwilling to speak out against the Modi government’s bitter bargain: that for us to exist as Indian citizens, we must meekly accept historical revisionism, dehumanization and demonization. This debasement, and the knowledge that you are essentially outside the protection of the law, kills something inside you. You take precautions to protect yourself. My mother no longer packs mutton for me to take back to Delhi after I visit her, as she used to. She’s afraid it will be mistaken for beef: Dozens of Muslims have reportedly been killed or assaulted by Hindu mobs on suspicion of killing cows — which are sacred to Hindus — or for eating or possessing beef. Muslim parents now routinely repeat a litany of don’ts to their children: Don’t appear Muslim in public, don’t reveal your name, don’t enter Hindu areas or travel alone and don’t get pulled into any potential confrontation. While we caution one another to blend in, it’s difficult to reconcile with the whole thing. Each of us has something embedded in our sense of self and expression that is particularly painful to erase. And the sort of physical markers we are trying to hide are not even wholly specific to Muslims in India. My cousin likes to wear his Pathani kurta, but so do many Hindus. My youngest sister prefers to keep her head covered, but so do many Hindu women, although not with a hijab. I’m attached to using certain Urdu words that have long been a feature of India’s syncretic culture and have been used widely by Hindus, too. Self-denial leads to deep frustration. Now during gatherings with friends and family, we avoid politics; discussing the elephant in the room only reminds us of our helplessness. The cumulative weight of all this has created a mental health crisis of fear and depression among Muslims. Yet because of a desperate shortage of mental health professionals in India and a limited understanding of our new reality by many non-Muslim therapists, many Muslims are left to cope on their own. I was hesitant to write this essay. I am not supposed to protest, to speak up. When I sometimes do, posting online about it, the typical response is, “Go to Pakistan.” But why would I leave? I am an Indian. I was born here, as were my ancestors who opposed the religious basis of the partition with Pakistan and believed in the Indian ideals of secular democracy. But many Muslims have fled over the years, emigrating to Australia, Canada, Britain, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia or elsewhere because of the worsening political climate. Many who can’t afford to emigrate are moving out of the predominantly Hindu or mixed neighborhoods where they lived for decades, to poorer Muslim areas for safety. Two of my Muslim friends and I used to own apartments in a suburban area near New Delhi where many upper-caste Hindus lived. But in 2020, after the discriminatory citizenship law was passed, a Hindu mob charged through the neighborhood baying for Muslim blood. My two friends soon moved out. I kept my apartment, but in the elevator one evening in 2022, I overheard two men discussing how many katua (a derogatory term for Muslims that refers to circumcision) lived in the area. I moved out the next day. Sadly, Hindu friends and colleagues of mine also have become colder and more distant and are dropping out of contact. On June 1, India’s voting period comes to a close. It looms as a day of dread for Muslims like me. According to most projections, it will be another victory for Mr. Modi — and further validation of mob rule and the debasement of 200 million Muslims by a hubristic Hindu majority.",used answer phone

nytimes,Free Food? Modi Makes Sure Every Indian Knows Whom to Thank for It.,"May 26, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/world/asia/india-welfare-modi.html,"Durga Prasad, an 80-year-old farmer, was resting under the shade of a tree in front of his home when the party workers came. An app on their smartphones could tell them in an instant who Mr. Prasad was, whom he might vote for — and why he should be grateful to India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. “You get installments of 2,000 rupees, right?” asked a local official from Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. Mr. Prasad concurred. He receives $72 a year through a farmers’ welfare program started and branded by Mr. Modi. “Do you get rations?” the official then asked, though he already knew the answer. He had made his point. Such handouts are among the most distinctive parts of Mr. Modi’s mass appeal. The country’s new airports, diplomatic prestige and booming stock markets may look like Mr. Modi’s calling card, but for the 95 percent of Indians who earn too little to file income taxes, small infusions of cash and household goods matter more. And Mr. Modi’s party is organized to make the most of them in the national election that ends early next month. India’s welfare programs are vast in reach and scope. Under the biggest, 821 million Indians are entitled to five-kilogram (11-pound) sacks of free rice or wheat every month. The government started doling out grain to prevent hunger early in the pandemic and has since committed $142 billion to the program. Mr. Modi’s face began appearing on the sacks in January. Another prime minister-branded program has helped people build 15 million homes since 2015, at a price tag of $3 billion a year; home improvements and additions are covered, too. The government has also footed the cost of millions of toilets, and it is working to provide piped drinking water to every home. The foundation of this expanded welfare system was laid soon after Mr. Modi became prime minister in 2014. Bank accounts, also “P.M.” branded, became available to all Indians who lacked them, meshed with a universal-ID program started by the previous government. The accounts gave the state valuable information about the financial lives of even its poorest citizens. And they opened the way for “direct benefit transfers,” money that bypasses the sometimes corrupt local officials who once distributed welfare — appearing to come instead from Mr. Modi himself. These transfers grew to $76 billion in the last fiscal year. But Mr. Modi’s budgets have not become profligate. That is in part because government spending on education and health care — long-term investments — has shrunk as a share of the economy as branded welfare programs have proliferated. Spending on a guaranteed-employment program associated with Mr. Modi’s opponents has also fallen. Whatever the motivation behind them, the tangible food and household benefits prioritized by Mr. Modi have relieved Indians’ pain as the economy slowed before the pandemic, collapsed during its first year and then recovered unevenly. The Hindu-nationalist government distributes the assistance equally among all religious groups, even if it does not receive many votes from some of them. The handouts are perhaps the most powerful thing Mr. Modi can point to when claiming credit for improving the lives of his fellow Indians, hundreds of millions of whom remain desperate for reliable jobs with decent pay. Vinod Misra, the local B.J.P. official who recently visited Mr. Prasad in Amethi, a district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, explained that in poorer places where people once died of hunger, “our party is working especially for programs that touch everyone.” “All we have to do is go and tell the family, ‘Brother, this roof you got, who made it happen?’” Mr. Misra said. In a country where 80 percent of the population is either rural or poor, people are dead serious about getting something in exchange for their votes, said Pradeep Gupta, the director of Axis My India, a polling outfit. If a politician delivers on promises, “the people elect you again and again and again,” Mr. Gupta said. Everything else is “marketing.” The B.J.P.’s follow-up with voters is the end result of a gargantuan effort that leverages its ideologically committed core membership, its funding, its nationwide organization and, increasingly, its sophisticated management of data. In the temple town of Pushkar, west of Amethi within the Hindi-speaking “cow belt” that is a stronghold of the B.J.P., another local party worker explained the virtue of an app called Saral. With a few swipes and taps, the worker, Shakti Singh Rathore, shared a bird’s-eye view of his neighbors, whom he intended to marshal for Mr. Modi. There are 241 “booths,” or polling stations, in Pushkar’s constituency, each with its own mapped boundaries. Mr. Rathore flicked open the information for one of the booths he was supervising. His targets were not just voters, but beneficiaries, or “labharthis” — an important new term of art in the ground campaign. “The labharthis’ names are all listed here,” Mr. Rathore said. One man he named had received a cooking gas cylinder — “here is his address and postal code and phone number.” Another had gotten cash from the farmers’ welfare program. “All the data is here,” Mr. Rathore said. Anyone can download Saral through the Apple or Google Play stores for campaign updates, though only enlisted B.J.P. workers get to explore its databases. The party’s national leadership has said it uses Saral to connect more than six million of its workers. They can both retrieve and upload data about voters and beneficiaries. Voters do not seem bothered, or are at least not surprised, that so much information about their relationships with the national government is carried door to door by political workers. Mr. Misra said he did not know exactly how all the personal information made its way into the app. Other local-level workers said they assumed that the data had been provided by the government itself, given its accuracy. Amit Malviya, the B.J.P.’s head of information and technology, said at a start-up conference in December that the 30 terabytes of data had been collected manually by the party over the past 10 elections. Saral does many other things that are useful for the party’s ground game. It tracks workers’ outreach and measures them against one another by their performance, in effect “gamifying” the hard slog of canvassing. It also gives the workers the chance to help smooth out voters’ receipt of their benefits, erasing the distinction between partisan politics and government work. Mr. Modi himself said to a TV crew this month that he had told party workers to gather information about voters who had not received their benefits and to “assure them that it’s the Modi guarantee — they will get it in my third term.” Ajay Singh Gaur, a B.J.P. worker who accompanied Mr. Misra for the doorstepping around Amethi, found himself drawn into a long exchange with Dinesh Maurya, a farmer who complained that a faulty electrical wire had fallen onto his wheat field. “My whole crop was burned down, and I haven’t got a single coin’s worth of compensation,” Mr. Maurya said. Mr. Gaur assured Mr. Maurya that he would get him the money the state owed him. “I have spoken to the officer in charge” at the generating station, he said. “I will get it done.”",durga prasad yearold

nytimes,Is Modi Worried? India’s Long-Deflated Opposition Finds Some Momentum.,"May 23, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/world/asia/india-election-modi-opposition.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi entered India’s general election projecting supreme confidence. “Ab ki baar, 400 paar” went his party’s slogan, meaning this time his side was gunning to surpass 400 seats in the lower house of Parliament, a staggering majority. But as the seven-week voting period enters its final stretch, with results expected on June 4, India is witnessing something unusual from its powerful leader. It is seeing him sweat. As Mr. Modi crisscrosses the country for rallies in 100-degree heat, he has often appeared on the defensive, and sometimes rattled. He has frequently set aside his party’s main campaign message — that India is rising under his leadership — to counter his opponents’ portrayal of him as favoring business and caste elites. He has resorted to stoking anti-Muslim sentiments to fend off attempts to split his Hindu support base, only to deny his own words later. Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., is still a heavy favorite. But it is finding that the political opposition, counted out after big losses to Mr. Modi in the previous two national elections, has some fight left in it. The opposition has found traction in challenging Mr. Modi’s control over the national narrative. With the broadcast media cowed by him, opposition leaders have turned to online platforms to find an audience for a pitch focused on economic and social justice, painting the prime minister as a primary culprit in India’s growing inequality. Before the election, often-bickering opposition parties united in a grand alliance to confront a shared threat: what they call Mr. Modi’s mission to cripple them and remake the country into one-party rule. The alliance lost precious time in the months before the vote, bogged down by internal differences. But it has largely held together despite Mr. Modi’s efforts to lure away some of its members and sideline others with legal actions. The alliance hopes that this translates into an improved electoral showing, after scattered votes for opposition parties in the 2019 election worked to Mr. Modi’s advantage. To have any hope of cutting significantly into the governing party’s existing strong majority in Parliament, the opposition will have to flip a large number of seats in the more populous north, where the B.J.P. is well entrenched, and hold its ground in the more prosperous south. “The opposition realized it was now or never,” said Arati Jerath, a political analyst in New Delhi. “It had to fight Modi with all the weapons it could muster or face certain death.” Analysts say elections that focus on local issues favor the opposition. This spring, Mr. Modi has again made a parliamentary election, contested across more than 540 seats, into a presidential-style national referendum on his own huge popularity and his achievements. But it has become clear that, a decade into his rule, his ability to steer elections away from local concerns — and cover for his party’s parochial struggles and infighting — is waning. The opposition has tried to take advantage with an energized ground game. In the lead-up to the vote, Mr. Modi intensified a political crackdown. Chief ministers of two opposition-controlled states were thrown in jail, and the bank accounts of the Indian National Congress, the main opposition party, were essentially frozen. “But people started campaigning door to door, village to village, state to state. So that has become really a groundwork for the opposition,” Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the Congress party, said in an interview. “Now they are frustrated,” he added, referring to the B.J.P. The Congress party is trying to pull itself out of an immense hole. The rise of caste-based regional parties marginalized the once-dominant Congress in India’s electorally crucial north, and Mr. Modi’s ascendence set it back further. Mr. Modi, who had spent a lifetime working his way up from a humble background, easily cast the face of the Congress, Rahul Gandhi, as a detached, lightweight beneficiary of dynastic politics. Just how far the Congress is trying to distance itself from that impression is evident in its election manifesto — both in form and substance. The party’s 2019 manifesto had a fresh-faced Mr. Gandhi front and center, with a message of jobs and economic development. In the 2024 document, he wears a graying beard, a nod to the time he spent connecting with rural India during two cross-country journeys since 2022, one of them covering 2,000 miles by foot. If that was not enough, next to him is the 81-year-old Mr. Kharge, elected in 2022 as the Congress president. His half a century in politics, and his background as a Dalit at the bottom of India’s rigid caste hierarchy, helps offset Mr. Modi’s personal story. The Congress’s campaign promises — from cash transfers to poor women to a “guarantee of first jobs” for young people through one-year paid apprenticeships — shows that it has learned from its successes in India’s southern states, said Sugata Srinivasaraju, the author of a book on Mr. Gandhi’s struggles in leading his party. “This is good,” Mr. Srinivasaraju said. “But the Congress does not have any emotional or cultural argument to counter” the B.J.P., with its Hindu-nationalist ideology. The closest the Congress has come is its effort to fuse two issues: longstanding caste inequality and rising unemployment. India’s Constitution sets aside about half of government jobs and seats in higher education for the middle and lower ranks in the caste system. With the economy struggling to create enough private-sector jobs, these government positions are seen as crucial for any hope of economic mobility. The Congress’s call for a census of Indians by caste — there has been no official national data on the size of each caste for decades — appears to be striking a chord. The party says such an exercise would ensure that marginalized Indians get their rightful share of slots. That push is also furthering two charges aimed at Mr. Modi: that he has overseen an economy that benefits only billionaires, and that his party has an upper-caste bias. While it is true that the B.J.P. was once an upper-caste, urban party, Mr. Modi has broadened its base by bringing in lower castes. But his response to the charge suggests he is nervous that the label may stick. “He’s for the rich,” Mr. Kharge said at a large rally in Mumbai. “He has done nothing for the poor.” Behind Mr. Kharge were the leaders of several parties in the alliance, each of whom would draw on a grievance to depict Mr. Modi as dangerous for India. One of them, Arvind Kejriwal, made a particularly personal case that Mr. Modi is trying to turn the country into something like Russia under President Vladimir V. Putin — “one nation, one leader.” “I am coming straight from jail,” Mr. Kejriwal began his speech. His Aam Aadmi Party holds power in the Delhi region and in the northern state of Punjab. Its expansion is a threat to Mr. Modi, whose government arrested Mr. Kejriwal over corruption allegations just before the election, creating the absurd reality in which India’s capital was being run from a jail cell. Mr. Kejriwal managed to get a three-week bail during the campaigning. As he jumps from rally to rally across the country, his connection with crowds makes clear why Mr. Modi would have liked to keep him behind bars. In Mumbai, he painted India under Mr. Modi as a dystopia where anyone who gets in the prime minister’s way will be locked up. Mr. Kejriwal said he had been kept under the surveillance of multiple cameras in jail — “watching what time I wake up, what time I go to the bathroom, how long I sit on the toilet.” Then he made his final appeal. This election, he said, is a vote for either keeping him in jail or restoring his freedom. He will be watching the results on June 4 from his cell. “You can write me letters,” he said. “Cell No. 25, Jail No. 2, Tihar Jail.”",prime minister narendra modi entered india general election

nytimes,Strangers in Their Own Land: Being Muslim in Modi’s India,"May 18, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/18/world/asia/muslims-india.html,"It is a lonely feeling to know that your country’s leaders do not want you. To be vilified because you are a Muslim in what is now a largely Hindu-first India. It colors everything. Friends, dear for decades, change. Neighbors hold back from neighborly gestures — no longer joining in celebrations, or knocking to inquire in moments of pain. “It is a lifeless life,” said Ziya Us Salam, a writer who lives on the outskirts of Delhi with his wife, Uzma Ausaf, and their four daughters. When he was a film critic for one of India’s main newspapers, Mr. Salam, 53, filled his time with cinema, art, music. Workdays ended with riding on the back of an older friend’s motorcycle to a favorite food stall for long chats. His wife, a fellow journalist, wrote about life, food and fashion. Now, Mr. Salam’s routine is reduced to office and home, his thoughts occupied by heavier concerns. The constant ethnic profiling because he is “visibly Muslim” — by the bank teller, by the parking lot attendant, by fellow passengers on the train — is wearying, he said. Family conversations are darker, with both parents focused on raising their daughters in a country that increasingly questions or even tries to erase the markers of Muslims’ identity — how they dress, what they eat, even their Indianness altogether. One of the daughters, an impressive student-athlete, struggled so much that she needed counseling and missed months of school. The family often debates whether to stay in their mixed Hindu-Muslim neighborhood in Noida, just outside Delhi. Mariam, their oldest daughter, who is a graduate student, leans toward compromise, anything to make life bearable. She wants to move. Anywhere but a Muslim area might be difficult. Real estate agents often ask outright if families are Muslim; landlords are reluctant to rent to them. “I have started taking it in stride,” Mariam said. “I refuse to,” Mr. Salam shot back. He is old enough to remember when coexistence was largely the norm in an enormously diverse India, and he does not want to add to the country’s increasing segregation. But he is also pragmatic. He wishes Mariam would move abroad, at least while the country is like this. Mr. Salam clings to the hope that India is in a passing phase. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, is playing a long game. His rise to national power in 2014, on a promise of rapid development, swept a decades-old Hindu nationalist movement from the margins of Indian politics firmly to the center. He has since chipped away at the secular framework and robust democracy that had long held India together despite its sometimes explosive religious and caste divisions. Right-wing organizations began using the enormous power around Mr. Modi as a shield to try to reshape Indian society. Their members provoked sectarian clashes as the government looked away, with officials showing up later to raze Muslim homes and round up Muslim men. Emboldened vigilante groups lynched Muslims they accused of smuggling beef (cows are sacred to many Hindus). Top leaders in Mr. Modi’s party openly celebrated Hindus who committed crimes against Muslims. On large sections of broadcast media, but particularly on social media, bigotry coursed unchecked. WhatsApp groups spread conspiracy theories about Muslim men luring Hindu women for religious conversion, or even about Muslims spitting in restaurant food. While Mr. Modi and his party officials reject claims of discrimination by pointing to welfare programs that cover Indians equally, Mr. Modi himself is now repeating anti-Muslim tropes in the election that ends early next month. He has targeted India’s 200 million Muslims more directly than ever, calling them “infiltrators” and insinuating that they have too many children. This creeping Islamophobia is now the dominant theme of Mr. Salam’s writings. Cinema and music, life’s pleasures, feel smaller now. In one book, he chronicled the lynchings of Muslim men. In a recent follow-up, he described how India’s Muslims feel “orphaned” in their homeland. “If I don’t pick up issues of import, and limit my energies to cinema and literature, then I won’t be able to look at myself in the mirror,” he said. “What would I tell my kids tomorrow — when my grandchildren ask me what were you doing when there was an existential crisis?” As a child, Mr. Salam lived on a mixed street of Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims in Delhi. When the afternoon sun would grow hot, the children would move their games under the trees in the yard of a Hindu temple. The priest would come with water for all. “I was like any other kid for him,” Mr. Salam recalled. Those memories are one reason Mr. Salam maintains a stubborn optimism that India can restore its secular fabric. Another is that Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalism, while sweeping large parts of the country, has been resisted by several states in the country’s more prosperous south. Family conversations among Muslims there are very different: about college degrees, job promotions, life plans — the usual aspirations. In the state of Tamil Nadu, often-bickering political parties are united in protecting secularism and in focusing on economic well-being. Its chief minister, M.K. Stalin, is a declared atheist. Jan Mohammed, who lives with his family of five in Chennai, the state capital, said neighbors joined in each other’s religious celebrations. In rural areas, there is a tradition: When one community finishes building a place of worship, villagers of other faiths arrive with gifts of fruits, vegetables and flowers and stay for a meal. “More than accommodation, there is understanding,” Mr. Mohammed said. His family is full of overachievers — the norm in their educated state. Mr. Mohammed, with a master’s degree, is in the construction business. His wife, Rukhsana, who has an economics degree, started an online clothing business after the children grew up. One daughter, Maimoona Bushra, has two master’s degrees and now teaches at a local college as she prepares for her wedding. The youngest, Hafsa Lubna, has a master’s in commerce and within two years went from an intern at a local company to a manager of 20. Two of the daughters had planned to continue on to Ph.D’s. The only worry was that potential grooms would be intimidated. “The proposals go down,” Ms. Rukhsana joked. A thousand miles north, in Delhi, Mr. Salam’s family lives in what feels like another country. A place where prejudice has become so routine that even a friendship of 26 years can be sundered as a result. Mr. Salam had nicknamed a former editor “human mountain” for his large stature. When they rode on the editor’s motorcycle after work in the Delhi winter, he shielded Mr. Salam from the wind. They were together often; when his friend got his driver’s license, Mr. Salam was there with him. “I would go to my prayer every day, and he would go to the temple every day,” Mr. Salam said. “And I used to respect him for that.” A few years ago, things began to change. The WhatsApp messages came first. The editor started forwarding to Mr. Salam some staples of anti-Muslim misinformation: for example, that Muslims will rule India in 20 years because their women give birth every year and their men are allowed four wives. “Initially, I said, ‘Why do you want to get into all this?’ I thought he was just an old man who was getting all these and forwarding,” Mr. Salam said. “I give him the benefit of doubt.” The breaking point came two years ago, when Yogi Adityanath, a Modi protégé, was re-elected as the leader of Uttar Pradesh, the populous state adjoining Delhi where the Salam family lives. Mr. Adityanath, more overtly belligerent than Mr. Modi toward Muslims, governs in the saffron robe of a Hindu monk, frequently greeting large crowds of Hindu pilgrims with flowers, while cracking down on public displays of Muslim faith. On the day of the vote counting, the friend kept calling Mr. Salam, rejoicing at Mr. Adityanath’s lead. Just days earlier, the friend had been complaining about rising unemployment and his son’s struggle to find a job during Mr. Adityanath’s first term. “I said, ‘You have been so happy since morning, what do you gain?’” he recalled asking the friend. “Yogi ended namaz,” the friend responded, referring to Muslim prayer on Fridays that often spills into the streets. “That was the day I said goodbye,” Mr. Salam said, “and he hasn’t come back into my life after that.”",lonely feeling know country leader want vilified muslim largely hindufirst india color everything friend dear decade

nytimes,La diplomacia de Musk: cautivar a la derecha mundial para beneficiarse,"May 16, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/05/16/espanol/elon-musk-lideres-mundiales-tesla-beneficios.html,"Unos minutos después de que se hizo evidente que Javier Milei había sido elegido presidente del segundo país más grande de América del Sur, en noviembre, Elon Musk publicó en la red social X (antes conocida como Twitter): “La prosperidad está por venir en Argentina”. Desde entonces, Musk ha seguido usando X, la red social de la que es dueño, para alentar a Milei. El multimillonario ha compartido videos en los que el presidente argentino ataca la “justicia social” con sus 182 millones de seguidores. Musk ha ayudado a convertir al belicoso libertario en uno de los nuevos rostros de la derecha moderna. Pero fuera de línea, ha aprovechado esta relación para ejercer presión y obtener beneficios para sus otras empresas, la fabricante de automóviles eléctricos Tesla y la constructora de cohetes espaciales SpaceX. “Me llamó Elon Musk”, afirmó Milei en una entrevista por televisión unas semanas después de asumir el cargo. “Está sumamente interesado en el litio”. Musk ha declarado que el litio —el elemento blanco-plateado que es el principal componente de las baterías de los autos de Tesla— es “el nuevo petróleo”. Tesla lleva mucho tiempo comprándole litio a Argentina, que es el segundo país con mayores reservas. Ahora, Milei presiona para que las mineras internacionales de litio reciban beneficios importantes, lo que probablemente le daría a Tesla un flujo más estable —y quizá más barato— de uno de los recursos más vitales para la empresa. Milei se ajusta a un patrón que sigue Musk de fomentar relaciones con una constelación de jefes de Estado de derecha, con beneficiarios muy claros: él mismo y sus empresas. Musk, de 52 años, ha utilizado en repetidas ocasiones una pieza de su imperio empresarial —la red social X— para expresar su apoyo a políticos como Milei, Jair Bolsonaro de Brasil y Narendra Modi de India. En la plataforma, Musk ha respaldado sus posturas en temas de género, ha celebrado su oposición al socialismo y ha confrontado con agresión a sus enemigos. Musk incluso cambió personalmente las políticas de contenido de la plataforma X de una forma que pareció beneficiar a Bolsonaro, según dijeron dos exempleados de la plataforma. Musk, a su vez, ha presionado y obtenido ventajas corporativas para sus empresas más lucrativas, Tesla y SpaceX, según un análisis de The New York Times. En India, logró que se le cobraran aranceles menores por la importación de los vehículos de Tesla. En Brasil, abrió un importante mercado nuevo para Starlink, el servicio de internet por satélite de SpaceX. En Argentina, aseguró el acceso al mineral más crucial para las baterías de Tesla. El respaldo de Musk les ha dado a muchos jefes de Estado nacionalistas y de derecha más prestigio internacional, el cual no han dudado en promocionar como una validación de sus políticas y popularidad. Musk, Tesla, SpaceX y la plataforma X no respondieron a nuestras solicitudes de comentarios. En septiembre de 2015, Musk recibió a Modi en la fábrica de Tesla en Fremont, California. Modi, político nacionalista indio, había sido electo primer ministro de India un año antes, cuando su partido, Bharatiya Janata, arrasó para llegar al poder, y visitaba Estados Unidos para reunirse con líderes empresariales. Musk y Modi posaron para las fotos cerca de un flamante automóvil rojo Model S. Comentaron que los “paneles solares y las baterías” podrían brindar electricidad a regiones rurales de India sin necesidad de líneas eléctricas, señaló Musk en ese entonces. “Comprendí su visión”, dijo más tarde Modi. Fue una de las primeras instancias en que Musk sostuvo una reunión en público con un líder nacionalista. Además, fue el principio de un plan a largo plazo con Modi, relación que tardó años en desarrollar y comenzó a redituarle a Musk después de que compró Twitter.. India podría ser un mercado masivo para Tesla, que necesita incursionar en regiones nuevas para crecer. Pero ese país prácticamente prohibió los vehículos eléctricos construidos por fabricantes extranjeros. En años recientes, los aranceles impuestos en India a los vehículos eléctricos importados han aumentado hasta un 100 por ciento. Musk recurrió en un principio a la diplomacia personal tradicional: se reunió con Modi y les ordenó a los empleados de Tesla estrechar relaciones con algunos funcionarios. Después de que Musk compró Twitter en 2022, aprovechó su nueva palanca. La plataforma, renombrada como X, se utiliza ampliamente en India —hasta Modi lo hace y tiene casi 98 millones de seguidores— y es un foro importante de debate político. Musk se reunió en persona con Modi de nuevo en junio pasado, cuando el primer ministro visitó Nueva York. Se identificó como “fan de Modi” y afirmó que Modi estaba “alentándonos a hacer inversiones significativas en India, algo que planeamos hacer”. Para entonces, los empleados de Tesla de nuevo sostenían conversaciones con los asesores de Modi sobre una reducción de los aranceles y una inversión en India, según indicaron dos personas familiarizadas con las conversaciones. Rohan Patel, quien era vicepresidente de política pública y desarrollo comercial de Tesla, viajó a India en varias ocasiones. Por su parte, Piyush Goyal, ministro de Comercio de India, visitó la fábrica de Fremont en noviembre. En enero, Musk publicó en X que India debería recibir un lugar permanente en el Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas, lo que reforzaría la posición internacional de India. “Que India no tenga un lugar permanente en el Consejo de Seguridad, a pesar de ser el país más poblado del planeta, es absurdo”, escribió Musk. Todo parece indicar que Modi se percató del comentario. Dos meses después, India anunció que había decidido reducir algunos aranceles de importación para los fabricantes de automóviles eléctricos que se comprometieran a asignar por lo menos 500 millones de dólares a la producción de vehículos en el país. La política redujo los aranceles del 100 al 15 por ciento del precio de cada automóvil, específicamente para los vehículos eléctricos con un precio superior a 35.000 dólares. La descripción se ajusta a Tesla a la perfección. Sus automóviles Model 3 tienen un precio de 38.990 dólares. Para 2021, Musk ya aplicaba una táctica similar para introducir el servicio de internet de su red de satélites Starlink en Brasil, gobernado en ese entonces por Bolsonaro, presidente populista de derecha elegido tres años antes. En esa época, Starlink estaba en pañales, con menos de 150.000 usuarios en 25 países. En octubre de 2021, Fábio Faria, ministro de Comunicaciones de Brasil y uno de los organizadores de la campaña de reelección de Bolsonaro, le envió una carta a Musk en la que le decía que “Starlink y Brasil pueden ser excelentes aliados”, según consta en correspondencia obtenida por las leyes de transparencia de información del país. Semanas más tarde, Faria visitó a Musk en Texas. Tras su regreso a Brasil, Faria presionó a los reguladores para que aprobaran a Starlink. En cierto momento, instó a la agencia espacial de Brasil a mantenerse al margen de cualquier debate sobre los satélites de SpaceX en el país, según testificó más adelante ante el Congreso Nacional de Brasil. Los reguladores de Brasil aprobaron la operación de Starlink en diciembre de 2021, siete meses después de presentada la primera solicitud del servicio. Fue la más rápida de las cinco aprobaciones que los reguladores les otorgaron a prestadores de servicios de internet por satélite. Musk ayudó más tarde a Bolsonaro, cuando enfrentó una difícil batalla en su campaña de 2022 por la reelección. El 20 de mayo de ese año, Musk hizo un viaje sorpresa a Brasil para hacer un anuncio importante con el presidente. Starlink iba a llegar al país y planeaba ofrecerles acceso a internet a 19.000 escuelas rurales, además del monitoreo ambiental de la Amazonía, según indicaron durante un evento en un complejo hotelero cerca de São Paulo. Bolsonaro le entregó a Musk una medalla y lo llamó una “verdadera leyenda de nuestra libertad” por su oferta de ese año para comprar Twitter.. Pero solo había un inconveniente: el plan de ofrecerles conexión a las escuelas nunca se concretó, explicó Carlos Baigorri, principal regulador de telecomunicaciones de Brasil, quien ayudó a aprobar el ingreso de Starlink en el país. “En realidad no creo que siquiera haya existido”, comentó acerca del plan. Musk y Bolsonaro se beneficiaron de cualquier manera. Musk había atrincherado a SpaceX en un mercado vital, en el que Starlink tiene ahora 150.000 cuentas activas, según la reguladora de telecomunicaciones de Brasil. La campaña de Bolsonaro logró promover la agudeza comercial del presidente y presentarlo como defensor de la Amazonía antes de las elecciones. El favor de Musk no evitó que Bolsonaro perdiera la presidencia ante Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, expresidente de izquierda de Brasil, en octubre de 2022. Pero en unas semanas, Musk, que acababa de concretar su acuerdo para comprar Twitter, intentó de nuevo ayudar a Bolsonaro. Los partidarios de Bolsonaro habían comenzado a impulsar acusaciones en Twitter de que algunos jueces brasileños habían inclinado la balanza en las elecciones cuando les ordenaron a las redes sociales eliminar publicaciones y cuentas con ideología de derecha. Mientras estaban instalados frente a bases militares para exigir la anulación de las elecciones, Musk alimentó sus sospechas dando a entender que los antiguos jefes de Twitter habían contribuido a la derrota de Bolsonaro. “Es posible que algunos empleados de Twitter les hayan dado preferencia a los candidatos de izquierda”, publicó en diciembre de 2022, sin mencionar ninguna evidencia. Más tarde, escribió que la empresa “quizá tenga personas en el equipo de Brasil con un fuerte sesgo político”. En 2022, uno de los proveedores de litio de Tesla anunció una inversión de 1100 millones de dólares para ampliar sus operaciones en Argentina. Desde entonces, Musk ha mostrado gran interés en la política argentina ―particularmente en Milei―, lo que ha generado uno de los bromances o “romance entre hermanos” más evidentes entre las relaciones políticas de Musk. Milei, economista libertario y comentarista de televisión, promovió durante su campaña la idea de sacar al gobierno de la economía y establecer una relación más estrecha entre Argentina y Estados Unidos. Al igual que Musk, insulta con frecuencia a sus críticos, tiene un hábito intenso con las redes sociales y está muy preocupado por la amenaza de la cultura progre. Unos días antes de la toma de posesión de Milei en diciembre, hablaron directamente por primera vez y Musk le preguntó sobre el litio de Argentina. En los meses posteriores, Milei ha impulsado legislación que haría mucho más atractiva la extracción de litio en Argentina para los inversionistas extranjeros. Su proyecto legislativo de gran envergadura, que le otorgaría, durante el año próximo, amplias facultades en situación de emergencia sobre la economía y la energía de Argentina, incluye un gran beneficio para Tesla: incentivos significativos para inversionistas extranjeros con proyectos grandes, en especial en la industria minera. Esas empresas recibirían recortes fiscales sustanciales, exenciones de impuestos aduaneros y beneficios de cambio de divisas, así como certidumbre fiscal y regulatoria por un periodo de 30 años. Es probable que califique el proveedor de litio de Tesla. En tal caso, el plan de Milei le daría a Tesla una estabilidad y predictibilidad inusuales en cuanto a su acceso a litio en Argentina por lo menos hasta 2054. La propuesta fue aprobada en la cámara baja del Congreso de Argentina el 30 de abril. Musk ya ha visto otros dividendos de Milei. En uno de sus primeros actos como presidente, Milei aprobó una orden ejecutiva con 366 disposiciones. Cuando sintetizó los puntos clave de la orden en un discurso por televisión, Milei mencionó solo una marca corporativa específica: Starlink. SpaceX había intentado lograr la aprobación de Starlink en Argentina desde 2022, pero estaba en un atolladero burocrático. Milei no tardó en reducir las regulaciones aplicables al internet por satélite, lo que le permitió a Starlink arrancar operaciones en el país en marzo.",unos minutos despus de que se hizo evidente que

nytimes,The Scrappy World War II Pilots Who Took Flight for a Perilous Mission,"May 14, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/books/review/skies-of-thunder-caroline-alexander.html,"“You and your outfit have been assigned one of the most important military missions ever given to American soldiers — the task of driving the Japanese back to Tokyo.” So begins “A Pocket Guide to India,” prepared for World War II service members in the western base section of the China-Burma-India Theater, commonly known as the C.B.I. “India is a strange, colorful land,” the guide continues. “If you exercise a normal amount of curiosity you’ll learn much that is fascinating; much that will enable you to begin stories to your children or grandchildren in later years, ‘Now, when I was in India. …’” If the guide seems to protest too much, perhaps that’s because the C.B.I. was, as Caroline Alexander explains in her riveting new book, “Skies of Thunder,” under-resourced, improvisational and rife with smugglers, its actual purpose murkier than its symbolic value. It was the war’s “most chaotic theater,” she writes, marked by “competing interests, and contradictions that exposed the fault lines between the Allies.” To some stationed there, C.B.I. stood for “Confusion Beyond Imagination.” My father, who served as an air traffic controller in the C.B.I., didn’t recall reading the “Pocket Guide,” but he did tell me stories of working in Delhi and Agra, a vital supply depot and service point, and traveling to various locations to lay radio-range beacons. The main point of these activities, he explained, was to enable pilots to fly supplies over the Himalayas to China. While it was always easy for me to picture my father in his control tower, those flights over the mountains remained mysterious until I read Alexander’s vivid account. Alexander, the author of books on Shackleton’s Endurance expedition and the fateful voyage of the Bounty, begins with the Allied loss of Burma to the Japanese in April 1942, which sealed off the ground supply corridor from India to China and led to the opening of an “aerial Burma Road.” This treacherous route, known as “the Hump,” supplied Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist government and Allied troops, including the 14th Air Force, commanded by the flamboyant Claire Chennault. Alexander casts her story as an “epic,” yet it is one in which the actors suffer like Job more often than they fight like Achilles. There are stirring episodes of British sang-froid, “American-style glamour” and remarkable courage among the region’s remote tribal peoples, but it is perseverance that assumes heroic proportions: refugees escaping through the Burmese jungle; soldiers and local laborers hacking through that same jungle to build a new road; Assam airfield personnel living in squalor, seared by the sun, swamped by monsoons, but most of all shrouded in a “miasma of cynical indifference.” What unites this book with the author’s previous work is a fascination with human behavior in extremis. While Alexander devotes considerable space to strategic and political issues, her interest lies primarily in the vicissitudes of individual human personality. In places she represents the theater’s dysfunction as a tragicomedy of failed relationships at the highest levels of command: between the mercurial Chiang Kai-shek and the American Joseph Stilwell, the theater’s irascible, insecure commanding general; between Stilwell and the unscrupulous, self-aggrandizing Chennault; between Stilwell and the British allies he loathed. Alexander’s gift for dramatizing these personal animosities occasionally produces seductive yet oversimplified biographical explanations of historical problems, a mode E.H. Carr described as “the Bad King John theory of history.” Ultimately, and rightly, the pilots — intrepid as “sailors of old” crossing “unknown oceans” — are the core of the book. Demeaned as “Hump drivers,” ostensible noncombatants at the bottom of the aviation hierarchy, they flew an inadequately charted route over baffling terrain, its surreality intensified by their frequent refusal to wear oxygen masks. Alexander adroitly explicates technical concepts — flight mechanics, de-icing, night vision — but is at her best rendering pilots’ fear. Besides terrain, its sources included weather, enemy aircraft, insufficient training, night missions and “short rations of fuel” on the return leg. At least a pilot could depend on his plane, the beloved Douglas C-47 Skytrain, until the introduction of unreliable or unsound higher-capacity models turned the machines themselves into another source of terror. Readers thrilled by sagas of flight will marvel at the logistics required to transport a stunning 650,000 tons of cargo by air, the audacity required to fly the Hump, the search-and-rescue operations necessitated by its hazards and the experimental use of aviation involved in the Allied recapture of Burma in 1944. They will also have to reckon with Alexander’s hard-nosed conclusions about the C.B.I. Others who have chronicled its history concentrated on the strategic merits of this deeply imperfect theater, or celebrated its pioneering use of air power. The image that dominates the end of Alexander’s epic is “the aluminum trail” of wreckage — “the hundreds of crashed aircraft that still lie undiscovered in the jungles, valleys and fractured ranges beneath the Hump’s old route.”",outfit assigned one important military mission ever given american soldier task driving japanese back tokyo begin pocket guide india prepared world war ii service member western base section chinaburmaindia theater commonly known cbi india strange colorful land guide continues exercise normal amount curiosity youll learn much fascinating much enable begin story child grandchild later year india guide seems protest much perhaps thats cbi caroline alexander explains riveting new book sky thunder underresourced improvisational rife smuggler actual purpose murkier symbolic value war chaotic theater writes marked competing interest contradiction exposed fault line ally stationed cbi stood confusion beyond imagination father served air traffic controller cbi didnt recall reading pocket guide tell story working delhi agra vital supply depot service point traveling various location lay radiorange beacon main point activity explained enable pilot fly supply himalaya china always easy picture father control tower flight mountain remained mysterious read alexander vivid account alexander author book shackletons endurance expedition fateful voyage bounty begin allied loss burma japanese april sealed ground supply corridor india china led opening aerial burma road treacherous route known hump supplied chiang kaisheks nationalist government allied troop including th air force commanded flamboyant claire chennault alexander cast story epic yet one actor suffer like job often fight like achilles stirring episode british sangfroid americanstyle glamour remarkable courage among region remote tribal people perseverance assumes heroic proportion refugee escaping burmese jungle soldier local laborer hacking jungle build new road assam airfield personnel living squalor seared sun swamped monsoon shrouded miasma cynical indifference unites book author previous work fascination human behavior extremis alexander devotes considerable space strategic political issue interest lie primarily vicissitude individual human personality place represents theater dysfunction tragicomedy failed relationship highest level command mercurial chiang kaishek american joseph stilwell theater irascible insecure commanding general stilwell unscrupulous selfaggrandizing chennault stilwell british ally loathed alexander gift dramatizing personal animosity occasionally produce seductive yet oversimplified biographical explanation historical problem mode eh carr described bad king john theory history ultimately rightly pilot intrepid sailor old crossing unknown ocean core book demeaned hump driver ostensible noncombatant bottom aviation hierarchy flew inadequately charted route baffling terrain surreality intensified frequent refusal wear oxygen mask alexander adroitly explicates technical concept flight mechanic deicing night vision best rendering pilot fear besides terrain source included weather enemy aircraft insufficient training night mission short ration fuel return leg least pilot could depend plane beloved douglas c skytrain introduction unreliable unsound highercapacity model turned machine another source terror reader thrilled saga flight marvel logistics required transport stunning ton cargo air audacity required fly hump searchandrescue operation necessitated hazard experimental use aviation involved allied recapture burma also reckon alexander hardnosed conclusion cbi others chronicled history concentrated strategic merit deeply imperfect theater celebrated pioneering use air power image dominates end alexander epic aluminum trail wreckage hundred crashed aircraft still lie undiscovered jungle valley fractured range beneath hump old route
nytimes,Man Accused in Plot to Assassinate Sikh Separatist Pleads Not Guilty,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/nyregion/nikhil-gupta-india-assassination-plot.html,"An Indian man pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of orchestrating a failed assassination plot against a Sikh separatist in New York, a plan that prosecutors say he devised on behalf of an unnamed official in India’s government. The defendant, Nikhil Gupta, 52, was arrested in the Czech Republic a year ago, and was extradited last week to make his first appearance in Manhattan federal court. He is accused of trying to arrange the murder of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American citizen and lawyer for a New York-based Sikh secessionist group. The murder attempt, which played out against a backdrop of doubt about India’s commitment to democracy, spanned several countries and mirrored the successful killing of another separatist in Canada, prosecutors say. On Monday morning, Mr. Gupta entered the Lower Manhattan courtroom in a blue cardigan and yellow patterned shirt and appeared relaxed as he spoke to his lawyer, Jeffrey Chabrowe, at the defense table. He has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since landing in the United States on Friday afternoon. In a statement to reporters after the arraignment, Mr. Chabrowe called the case a “complex matter"" for India and the United States. “Background and details will develop that may cast government allegations into an entirely new light,” he said. Mr. Gupta is charged with murder for hire and conspiracy to commit murder for hire. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison for each charge. He was sent back to the detention center after Monday’s arraignment and is set to appear in court again on June 28. In a statement Monday, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said Mr. Gupta will “now face justice” in an American courtroom. “This extradition makes clear that the Justice Department will not tolerate attempts to silence or harm American citizens,” he said. In an indictment unsealed in November, Manhattan federal prosecutors described an audacious plot that began around May 2023 when an Indian government employee enlisted Mr. Gupta to organize the killing of Mr. Pannun, who was living in New York at the time. Mr. Pannun is the general counsel of Sikhs for Justice, an organization that supports the secession of Punjab, a state in northern India. He is a vocal critic of the Indian government and has been banned from the country, prosecutors say. Mr. Gupta, who lived in India, had told the government official about “his involvement in international narcotics and weapons trafficking,” according to the indictment. At the direction of the Indian government employee, Mr. Gupta contacted a man who he believed would help him hire a hit man in New York, but who was, in fact, an agent for the American government. That agent introduced Mr. Gupta to an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration officer who pretended to be the hit man. In deals brokered by Mr. Gupta, the Indian government official agreed to pay the D.E.A. officer $100,000 to kill Mr. Pannun, including a $15,000 cash advance for the job, prosecutors said. Mr. Gupta then shared personal information about Mr. Pannun with the undercover officer, including Mr. Pannun’s address in New York and his phone number. When the Indian official asked for updates, Mr. Gupta relayed surveillance photos of Mr. Pannun that the agent had sent him. Mr. Gupta instructed the undercover officer to carry out the assassination as soon as possible, but asked him not to do it around the time of high-level meetings between U.S. and Indian officials, according to the indictment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington and met with President Biden in June 2023. Then, prosecutors said, on June 18 of that year, gunmen killed Hardeep Singh Nijjar, another Sikh separatist leader, in British Columbia, Canada. Mr. Nijjar knew Mr. Pannun and was also an outspoken critic of the Indian government. Soon after, prosecutors said, Mr. Gupta told the undercover officer that Mr. Nijjar “was also the target” and that “we have so many targets.” Mr. Gupta then told the officer — the pretend hit man — that there was “now no need to wait” to kill Mr. Pannun, prosecutors said. On Monday, Mr. Pannun said in a statement that he had “full faith” that the United States would hold Mr. Gupta and his co-conspirators accountable. “The attempt on my life on American soil is the blatant case of India’s transnational terrorism challenging America’s sovereignty and unequivocally proves that Modi’s India believes in using violence to suppress the dissenting political opinion,” he said. A spokesman for the Indian Embassy in Washington, D.C., could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. Mr. Gupta’s case has threatened to complicate the delicate relations among Washington, Ottawa and New Delhi. During his presidency, Mr. Biden has courted India’s leaders to counter the influence of Russia and China, despite growing concerns about India’s commitment to democracy. Mr. Modi, who has been in office since 2014, was re-elected as India’s prime minister in June, even as his Bharatiya Janata Party lost its majority in Parliament.",indian man pleaded guilty monday charge orchestrating failed assassination plot sikh separatist new york plan prosecutor say devised behalf unnamed official india government defendant nikhil gupta arrested czech republic year ago extradited last week make first appearance manhattan federal court accused trying arrange murder gurpatwant singh pannun american citizen lawyer new yorkbased sikh secessionist group murder attempt played backdrop doubt india commitment democracy spanned several country mirrored successful killing another separatist canada prosecutor say monday morning mr gupta entered lower manhattan courtroom blue cardigan yellow patterned shirt appeared relaxed spoke lawyer jeffrey chabrowe defense table held metropolitan detention center brooklyn since landing united state friday afternoon statement reporter arraignment mr chabrowe called case complex matter india united state background detail develop may cast government allegation entirely new light said mr gupta charged murder hire conspiracy commit murder hire convicted would face maximum year prison charge sent back detention center monday arraignment set appear court june statement monday attorney general merrick b garland said mr gupta face justice american courtroom extradition make clear justice department tolerate attempt silence harm american citizen said indictment unsealed november manhattan federal prosecutor described audacious plot began around may indian government employee enlisted mr gupta organize killing mr pannun living new york time mr pannun general counsel sikh justice organization support secession punjab state northern india vocal critic indian government banned country prosecutor say mr gupta lived india told government official involvement international narcotic weapon trafficking according indictment direction indian government employee mr gupta contacted man believed would help hire hit man new york fact agent american government agent introduced mr gupta undercover drug enforcement administration officer pretended hit man deal brokered mr gupta indian government official agreed pay dea officer kill mr pannun including cash advance job prosecutor said mr gupta shared personal information mr pannun undercover officer including mr pannuns address new york phone number indian official asked update mr gupta relayed surveillance photo mr pannun agent sent mr gupta instructed undercover officer carry assassination soon possible asked around time highlevel meeting u indian official according indictment prime minister narendra modi visited washington met president biden june prosecutor said june year gunman killed hardeep singh nijjar another sikh separatist leader british columbia canada mr nijjar knew mr pannun also outspoken critic indian government soon prosecutor said mr gupta told undercover officer mr nijjar also target many target mr gupta told officer pretend hit man need wait kill mr pannun prosecutor said monday mr pannun said statement full faith united state would hold mr gupta coconspirator accountable attempt life american soil blatant case india transnational terrorism challenging america sovereignty unequivocally prof modis india belief using violence suppress dissenting political opinion said spokesman indian embassy washington dc could immediately reached comment monday mr guptas case threatened complicate delicate relation among washington ottawa new delhi presidency mr biden courted india leader counter influence russia china despite growing concern india commitment democracy mr modi office since reelected india prime minister june even bharatiya janata party lost majority parliament
nytimes,Train Crash in India Leaves at Least 8 Dead and Dozens Injured,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/world/asia/india-train-crash.html,"A freight train collided with a passenger train in eastern India on Monday, killing at least eight people and injuring 50 others, officials said. The episode occurred at around 9 a.m. when the Kanchanjunga Express, which was carrying passengers to the state of West Bengal from the state of Tripura, was leaving the Rangapani station. Four coaches of the popular and often-crowded passenger train derailed when it was rammed from behind by the commercial train. Images from the accident site showed one of the passenger coaches lifted off the railway track and balancing on a coach of the freight train. The death toll was likely to rise. Local news outlets, citing police officials, reported at least 15 people dead. The driver and the assistant driver of the freight train and a guard on the passenger train were among those killed. Jaya Varma Sinha, the chairperson of India’s railway board, said rescue operations were completed. Ashwini Vaishnaw, India’s railway minister, was en route to the site. The relatively low number of casualties could be attributed to the fact that the rear portion of the Kanchanjunga Express, which took the biggest impact from the collision, comprised cargo coaches and the guard’s coach. Passengers were in compartments far forward from the impact. While an investigation has been ordered to look into the cause of the collision, Ms. Sinha said human error such as disregarding a railway signal could have caused the crash. The accident again brings to the fore the issue of rail safety in a country whose millions of poor residents rely on railways for transport. India’s rail network is one of the world’s largest and is crucial to the country’s economy and its people’s lives and livelihood. The country has, in recent years, invested heavily on rail safety after a long history of deadly accidents. Although the overall number of rail accidents has lessened over the past decade, incidents with mass casualties have persisted. Last June, 290 people were killed when two passenger trains collided after one of them struck a stationary freight train at full speed and derailed in the state of Odisha. After that incident, opposition leaders demanded the resignation of Mr. Vaishnaw, the railway minister. He has said he was trying to expand a safety system, called Kavach, that is meant to prevent accidents when two trains are moving on the same track. Ms. Sinha said the technology had not yet been deployed on the route of the Kanchanjunga Express.",freight train collided passenger train eastern india monday killing least eight people injuring others official said episode occurred around kanchanjunga express carrying passenger state west bengal state tripura leaving rangapani station four coach popular oftencrowded passenger train derailed rammed behind commercial train image accident site showed one passenger coach lifted railway track balancing coach freight train death toll likely rise local news outlet citing police official reported least people dead driver assistant driver freight train guard passenger train among killed jaya varma sinha chairperson india railway board said rescue operation completed ashwini vaishnaw india railway minister en route site relatively low number casualty could attributed fact rear portion kanchanjunga express took biggest impact collision comprised cargo coach guard coach passenger compartment far forward impact investigation ordered look cause collision m sinha said human error disregarding railway signal could caused crash accident brings fore issue rail safety country whose million poor resident rely railway transport india rail network one world largest crucial country economy people life livelihood country recent year invested heavily rail safety long history deadly accident although overall number rail accident lessened past decade incident mass casualty persisted last june people killed two passenger train collided one struck stationary freight train full speed derailed state odisha incident opposition leader demanded resignation mr vaishnaw railway minister said trying expand safety system called kavach meant prevent accident two train moving track m sinha said technology yet deployed route kanchanjunga express
nytimes,"G7 Leaders, Expanding the Circle, Shift Focus to Migration and the South","June 14, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/world/europe/g7-summit-ai-china-india.html,"The Group of 7 countries threw open the doors of their club on Friday to India, Brazil, Turkey and other non-Western countries, acknowledging a shifting global landscape as they tried to enlist these nations’ leaders in causes ranging from climate change to managing the economic competition with China. While diplomats from the Group of 7 hammered out a communiqué that pledged support for Ukraine in its war against Russia and greater ambition in curbing carbon emissions, the focus was on Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and other leaders from outside the G7, whose support is increasingly critical to achieving any of these goals. Among the thorny questions on the second day of the summit: migration, which has helped fuel a recent resurgence of populism and far-right parties in Europe and the United States. The leaders also discussed the war in Gaza and China’s state subsidies of industries like electric vehicles, which has prompted the United States and the European Union to impose tariffs on Chinese exports. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, who is hosting the gathering, said the goal of her expanded guest list was to “strengthen dialogue with the nations of the Global South.” She insisted that the Group of 7 was “not a fortress closed in itself” but “an offer of values that we open to the world.” Ms. Meloni recruited Pope Francis to speak to the leaders about the dangers posed by artificial intelligence. Francis urged them to regulate the technology, of which he was himself a victim when A.I.-generated fake images of him clad in a white puffer jacket and a jewel-encrusted crucifix went viral last year. “The benefits and the damages it causes will depend on the way it is used,” the pope declared, warning of the risks of A.I.’s uncontrolled development. He called for lethal autonomous weapons, which are unmanned and uncontrolled by a human hand, to be banned, saying, “No machine should ever decide whether to take the life of a human being away.” The pope’s appearance was the emotional highlight of a day of carefully staged summitry that seemed to concede that the West is less dominant demographically and economically than in the past — and that it is listening to calls for more equity and balance in global decision-making. As Ms. Meloni guided the pope, in a wheelchair, around a circular table to meet the leaders, he was greeted by a visibly moved President Biden and got an enthusiastic hug from Argentina’s flamboyant president, Javier Milei, whose election last November was viewed as another sign of the rising tide of populism across the Americas and Europe. This is not the first time non-Western leaders have been invited to a Group of 7 meeting, but rarely have they been so conspicuous. In part that reflects the issues that Ms. Meloni has highlighted: Africa and the Mediterranean. The leaders of Algeria, Kenya and Tunisia were on hand at a luxury resort hotel on Italy’s southern coast, as was President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. “Inviting key developing country leaders reflects the reality that confronting China and Russia requires the cooperation of more than the G7,” said Daniel M. Price, who was a top trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “And Brazil, India and Turkey are as concerned about Chinese predatory trade practices and overcapacity as are Japan, Europe and the U.S.” The final G7 communiqué voiced concern about what the leaders called China’s “persistent industrial targeting and comprehensive nonmarket policies and practices that are leading to global spillovers, market distortions and harmful overcapacity.” The communiqué endorsed Mr. Biden’s effort to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. France and Canada had pushed for stronger language on Israel’s conduct of the war, according to people familiar with the negotiations, but the United States and Germany resisted. In a victory for Ms. Meloni, a conservative who opposes abortion, the communiqué did not include an explicit reference to abortion, in a passage that pledged to promote “comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.” A communiqué released by the Group of 7 leaders after their last summit in Hiroshima, Japan, referred specifically to abortion rights. The issue injected a briefly discordant note into the gathering after President Emmanuel Macron of France told an Italian journalist that some politicians did not share France’s “vision of equality between women and men.” Ms. Meloni criticized Mr. Macron, who recently called a snap parliamentary election, as seeking to politicize the issue at a “precious forum like the G7.” For the most part, however, the meeting underscored harmony among the leaders, many of whom are embattled by their own domestic politics. It also served as a platform for Ms. Meloni, 47, who has overcome initial qualms about her political roots in a party built on the ashes of fascism to win respect for her steadfast support of Ukraine. Presiding over the two days of meetings, she was able to put a spotlight on several of her pet issues. How to control migration has vexed the United States and Europe, compounded by the effects of climate change and warfare in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Ukraine. It is a particularly delicate issue for Ms. Meloni, who has campaigned hard to fight what she has called “uncontrolled immigration” to Italy and other parts of Europe from Africa and the Middle East. While Europe has welcomed thousands of Ukrainians, especially women and children, fleeing the Russian invasion, Ukrainian officials have urged European countries to help them repatriate men of fighting age. “Turkey is a critical player on global migration,” said Peter Westmacott, who served as Britain’s ambassador to Turkey, France and the United States. He noted that there are about three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds and Afghans. “If Europe wants to control migration from these countries,” Mr. Westmacott said, “Turkey is an indispensable partner.” Mr. Erdogan, he said, could also yet play a role in brokering an end to Ukraine’s war with Russia. As a Black Sea power, Turkey has kept open its commercial and political links to Russia. But it is also a NATO member and has supplied cheap, highly effective drones to help the Ukrainian resistance. Some of the invitations reflected diplomatic protocol, according to Italian officials. Brazil, India and South Africa were automatically included as current or future presidents of the Group of 20 industrialized nations. Argentina was invited, these officials said, because Mr. Milei has recognized the connections and interdependence between East and West. He and Ms. Meloni have also cultivated close personal ties, sharing a right-wing populism that includes opposition to abortion and gay rights.",group country threw open door club friday india brazil turkey nonwestern country acknowledging shifting global landscape tried enlist nation leader cause ranging climate change managing economic competition china diplomat group hammered communiqu pledged support ukraine war russia greater ambition curbing carbon emission focus prime minister narendra modi india president luiz incio lula da silva brazil leader outside g whose support increasingly critical achieving goal among thorny question second day summit migration helped fuel recent resurgence populism farright party europe united state leader also discussed war gaza china state subsidy industry like electric vehicle prompted united state european union impose tariff chinese export prime minister giorgia meloni italy hosting gathering said goal expanded guest list strengthen dialogue nation global south insisted group fortress closed offer value open world m meloni recruited pope francis speak leader danger posed artificial intelligence francis urged regulate technology victim aigenerated fake image clad white puffer jacket jewelencrusted crucifix went viral last year benefit damage cause depend way used pope declared warning risk ai uncontrolled development called lethal autonomous weapon unmanned uncontrolled human hand banned saying machine ever decide whether take life human away pope appearance emotional highlight day carefully staged summitry seemed concede west le dominant demographically economically past listening call equity balance global decisionmaking m meloni guided pope wheelchair around circular table meet leader greeted visibly moved president biden got enthusiastic hug argentina flamboyant president javier milei whose election last november viewed another sign rising tide populism across america europe first time nonwestern leader invited group meeting rarely conspicuous part reflects issue m meloni highlighted africa mediterranean leader algeria kenya tunisia hand luxury resort hotel italy southern coast president recep tayyip erdogan turkey inviting key developing country leader reflects reality confronting china russia requires cooperation g said daniel price top trade adviser president george w bush brazil india turkey concerned chinese predatory trade practice overcapacity japan europe u final g communiqu voiced concern leader called china persistent industrial targeting comprehensive nonmarket policy practice leading global spillover market distortion harmful overcapacity communiqu endorsed mr bidens effort broker ceasefire israel hamas gaza france canada pushed stronger language israel conduct war according people familiar negotiation united state germany resisted victory m meloni conservative opposes abortion communiqu include explicit reference abortion passage pledged promote comprehensive sexual reproductive health right communiqu released group leader last summit hiroshima japan referred specifically abortion right issue injected briefly discordant note gathering president emmanuel macron france told italian journalist politician share france vision equality woman men m meloni criticized mr macron recently called snap parliamentary election seeking politicize issue precious forum like g part however meeting underscored harmony among leader many embattled domestic politics also served platform m meloni overcome initial qualm political root party built ash fascism win respect steadfast support ukraine presiding two day meeting able put spotlight several pet issue control migration vexed united state europe compounded effect climate change warfare afghanistan middle east ukraine particularly delicate issue m meloni campaigned hard fight called uncontrolled immigration italy part europe africa middle east europe welcomed thousand ukrainian especially woman child fleeing russian invasion ukrainian official urged european country help repatriate men fighting age turkey critical player global migration said peter westmacott served britain ambassador turkey france united state noted three million syrian refugee turkey well hundred thousand iraqi kurd afghan europe want control migration country mr westmacott said turkey indispensable partner mr erdogan said could also yet play role brokering end ukraine war russia black sea power turkey kept open commercial political link russia also nato member supplied cheap highly effective drone help ukrainian resistance invitation reflected diplomatic protocol according italian official brazil india south africa automatically included current future president group industrialized nation argentina invited official said mr milei recognized connection interdependence east west m meloni also cultivated close personal tie sharing rightwing populism includes opposition abortion gay right
nytimes,Fire in Kuwait Worker Housing Leaves at Least 49 Dead,"June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/world/middleeast/fire-kuwait-migrant-worker-housing.html,"At least 49 people were killed and dozens of others injured in the Persian Gulf country of Kuwait, the state news agency said, when a fire broke out on Wednesday in a building that housed scores of low-income workers, many of them Indian nationals. The fire began during the morning in a coastal area called Mangaf, about half an hour’s drive from the center of the capital, Kuwait City. The Kuwaiti authorities have held the building owner for questioning as they investigate the cause of the fire and try to determine whether “any shortcoming or neglect” played a role, the state news agency reported. The authorities promised to begin a campaign to tackle building code violations. The public prosecutor’s office also planned to inspect the site and interview survivors. Speaking to journalists at the site of the fire, Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Al Sabah — Kuwait’s deputy prime minister and interior minister — blamed “the greed of property owners” for the disaster and said that the owner of the company employing the workers would also be detained, the Reuters news agency and Kuwaiti newspapers reported. Jayashankar, an Indian salesman who survived the fire, said that he awoke to screams around 4 a.m. local time. He and his roommates opened the door to their fourth-floor apartment and found that thick black smoke had enveloped the corridor, burning their lungs, he said in a phone interview, asking to be identified by his first name only for fear of retribution. Instead of trying to escape, he said, they locked the door, opened a window and waited for help. Two of his roommates who left the apartment to find an exit later died, he said. Witnesses told local news outlets that the fire had begun at the bottom of the seven-story building, sending smoke billowing upward. In a televised interview, an official in Kuwait’s firefighting force, Col. Sayed Hassan Al-Moussawi, said, “In a building like this, you’re supposed to go up to the roof, but unfortunately the door to the roof was locked.” Ramesh, an Indian worker who lives in a building next door and who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said in an interview that he saw people trying to jump out of windows to escape. The fire’s high death toll highlighted the perils faced by low-income immigrants to Gulf countries, who often toil under exploitative contracts and live in overcrowded housing, with regulatory protections that are limited or poorly enforced. Foreigners make up about two-thirds of the population of Kuwait, an oil-rich nation with one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds. Many are low-paid workers from South Asian countries who perform jobs including construction, restaurant service and street cleaning. More than 50 people hurt during the fire were sent to hospitals around Kuwait, with injuries including burns, broken bones from jumping out of the building and carbon monoxide poisoning from smoke inhalation, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. Nine were in critical condition, it said. Many of the workers affected were from India, the country’s embassy in Kuwait said on social media. On Wednesday, India’s ambassador to Kuwait, Adarsh Swaika, visited several hospitals where workers were taken, the embassy said in its posts. In a post on X, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India said that the fire was “saddening” and that the Indian Embassy would monitor the situation closely and work with the authorities “to assist the affected.” In a video published by the Kuwaiti news media, Sheikh Fahad was shown at the location of the fire, questioning an unidentified man about who lived in the building. The man told him that 196 people had lived there. The video cut off after Sheikh Fahad told the authorities to detain the man for questioning. Officials working in the municipality overseeing the area were also suspended from work pending an investigation, Kuwait’s state news agency reported. Building codes in Gulf countries are often laxly put in place, and smoke detectors and fire escapes are not common in residential properties. At the site of the fire on Wednesday afternoon, municipal employees were already putting up notices of violations on nearby buildings, including for partitioning rooms with gypsum board. Mangaf is predominantly inhabited by migrant workers, with apartment blocks housing men from India, Bangladesh and Egypt. Interviewed by The New York Times near the fire location, workers who lived nearby gave varying accounts of the numbers of men typically housed in each room, ranging from three to 12. Jayashankar, the survivor, said that nine people, all Indians, had shared his three-bedroom apartment. The building bore a sign saying it was a workers’ camp for a company called NBTC Group, a contracting firm headquartered in Kuwait with business in construction, industry, logistics and related fields. Phone calls to the company on Wednesday went unanswered, and an employee at the company’s offices said that staff members had been detained by officials that day. Another Indian worker who lived on the second floor of the building said that he and his roommates had survived because they had been out working an overnight shift. The worker, Sami, 45, who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said he had not yet been able to go inside to retrieve his belongings and inspect the damage because the police had closed off entrances to the building. Shahrukh Kha, who is from Bihar, India, said that he had spent all day trying to reach his brother, Kalu, who lived in the building, but that his brother’s phone was off. “We have not gotten any kind of information about whether he is injured or dead,” he said in a phone interview. Kalu Kha, a 30-year-old salesman who works in a fruit and vegetable shop, had been planning to travel home to India next month, his brother said; his wedding date is set for July 22.",least people killed dozen others injured persian gulf country kuwait state news agency said fire broke wednesday building housed score lowincome worker many indian national fire began morning coastal area called mangaf half hour drive center capital kuwait city kuwaiti authority held building owner questioning investigate cause fire try determine whether shortcoming neglect played role state news agency reported authority promised begin campaign tackle building code violation public prosecutor office also planned inspect site interview survivor speaking journalist site fire sheikh fahad yusuf al sabah kuwait deputy prime minister interior minister blamed greed property owner disaster said owner company employing worker would also detained reuters news agency kuwaiti newspaper reported jayashankar indian salesman survived fire said awoke scream around local time roommate opened door fourthfloor apartment found thick black smoke enveloped corridor burning lung said phone interview asking identified first name fear retribution instead trying escape said locked door opened window waited help two roommate left apartment find exit later died said witness told local news outlet fire begun bottom sevenstory building sending smoke billowing upward televised interview official kuwait firefighting force col sayed hassan almoussawi said building like youre supposed go roof unfortunately door roof locked ramesh indian worker life building next door also asked identified first name fear retribution said interview saw people trying jump window escape fire high death toll highlighted peril faced lowincome immigrant gulf country often toil exploitative contract live overcrowded housing regulatory protection limited poorly enforced foreigner make twothirds population kuwait oilrich nation one world largest sovereign wealth fund many lowpaid worker south asian country perform job including construction restaurant service street cleaning people hurt fire sent hospital around kuwait injury including burn broken bone jumping building carbon monoxide poisoning smoke inhalation ministry health said statement nine critical condition said many worker affected india country embassy kuwait said social medium wednesday india ambassador kuwait adarsh swaika visited several hospital worker taken embassy said post post x prime minister narendra modi india said fire saddening indian embassy would monitor situation closely work authority assist affected video published kuwaiti news medium sheikh fahad shown location fire questioning unidentified man lived building man told people lived video cut sheikh fahad told authority detain man questioning official working municipality overseeing area also suspended work pending investigation kuwait state news agency reported building code gulf country often laxly put place smoke detector fire escape common residential property site fire wednesday afternoon municipal employee already putting notice violation nearby building including partitioning room gypsum board mangaf predominantly inhabited migrant worker apartment block housing men india bangladesh egypt interviewed new york time near fire location worker lived nearby gave varying account number men typically housed room ranging three jayashankar survivor said nine people indian shared threebedroom apartment building bore sign saying worker camp company called nbtc group contracting firm headquartered kuwait business construction industry logistics related field phone call company wednesday went unanswered employee company office said staff member detained official day another indian worker lived second floor building said roommate survived working overnight shift worker sami also asked identified first name fear retribution said yet able go inside retrieve belonging inspect damage police closed entrance building shahrukh kha bihar india said spent day trying reach brother kalu lived building brother phone gotten kind information whether injured dead said phone interview kalu kha yearold salesman work fruit vegetable shop planning travel home india next month brother said wedding date set july
nytimes,"At the Ambani Wedding Celebrations, a Dazzling Display of Jewels","June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/fashion/weddings/ambani-jewels.html,"When Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India abruptly changed her country’s constitution in 1971 and abolished the Privy Purse, a government allowance for the country’s former princely rulers, she also moved to nationalize their storied treasuries. Among the maharajahs, nizams and nabobs that once ruled the subcontinent, this set off a frenzy as they scurried to bury the family jewels. For centuries, the rarity, scale and grandeur of Indian jewels was so great that many became iconic objects. Take the Patiala Necklace, a tiered ornament resembling draperies of gems. Designed by Cartier, it featured an astounding 2,930 diamonds and centered on a single rock the size of a walnut. Or consider the Indore Pears, two stupendous and closely matched diamonds owned by Maharajah Yeshwant Rao Holkar II, a glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom was in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Indian princely patronage long set a global standard of splendor for both artistry and ostentation in the jewel trade. Yet in the decades after the Privy Purse, most of the big rocks seemed to have vanished underground. Legend has it that members of formerly royal families stashed their jewels in Swiss vaults, pawned them on the black market or hid them in flower pots. Bling on a royal scale largely disappeared. Or so it seemed until a fresh cadre of princes heaved into view: oligarchs. The richest of these by orders of magnitude is Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of his family’s megacompany Reliance Industries. Mr. Ambani’s personal fortune is estimated by Forbes at a staggering $115 billion. Despite his vast wealth, few outside India had heard of him — that is, until March 1, when he hosted a three-day party to celebrate his son Anant’s wedding in July. Everything about the prewedding affair was on a princely scale: the guest list of 1,000, including boldface names like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump; a glass palace specially constructed in the Ambani’s hometown, Jamnagar, in the western state of Gujarat; and Rihanna’s first public performance in years. Rihanna’s reported $6 million payday hogged the headlines, but what lit up at least one obsessive corner of the internet was the Ambani jewelry. This included necklaces and earrings and rings and hair ornaments of a size and grandeur seldom seen publicly since the days of the Raj. “It was almost like the time of maharajahs 100 years down the line,” said Pramod Kumar, an archivist and a founder of the museum consultancy EKA. He is also keeper of topophilia.india, an erudite Instagram account that is catnip for Indophile aesthetes. Mr. Kumar’s sleuth work traced a possible source of the two most gobsmacking gems seen at the Ambani prewedding celebration: massive step-cut Colombian emeralds roughly the size of Popsicles. Draped one below the other as pendants to a diamond necklace, they were worn one evening by the bridegroom’s mother, Nita Ambani. The bigger one was “of 562 carats,” Mr. Kumar wrote in an Instagram post, adding that the weight of the smaller stone was a mere 303 carats. Whatever their source, those emeralds were just two among many gems on display throughout an event at which the jewels often had greater star power than their wearers. “That emerald necklace was what caught everyone’s attention at first, but it was all almost unfathomable,” said Stellene Volandes, the editor in chief of Town & Country. She noted the scarcity represented by ropes of the rarest natural pearls from the Arabian Sea; necklaces in the heavy, ornate rani haar style studded with diamonds; and headpieces known as maang tikka, made with deep green emeralds from the storied Muzo mines. “You’d be very hard-pressed to find comparables for the sheer size and horsepower” of the jewels at the Ambani prewedding party, said Nico Landrigan, the president of the Verdura jewelry house in New York. “The Indians are a jewelry-obsessed culture in a category all their own. So you can only imagine what the actual wedding will bring out.” Before the wedding, scheduled for July 12 to 14 in Mumbai, there was yet another lavish preparatory celebration and opportunity to flaunt big rocks — a cruise from the Tyrrhenian Sea in Palermo, Italy, to the Mediterranean in Cannes, France, on an ocean liner whose 2,400 staterooms had been retrofitted for the Ambanis as three-bedroom suites for 800 invited guests. “Basically, what the Ambanis are doing is displaying a kind of old-style Hollywood glam,” said Mr. Kumar of EKA. “You don’t see that with any other current billionaire moguls in Europe or America, at least not in the public realm.” For Daniela Mascetti, the former chairwoman of Sotheby’s jewelry division in Europe and an author of “Understanding Jewelry,” a bible of the trade, the group more aptly compared to the Ambanis is the robber barons of the Industrial Age. “You have to look back to Vanderbilt or Gould, who also wanted big door-stoppers,” Ms. Mascetti said from London. “Let’s put it in a nice way,” she added. “If you are new money and you want to display wealth, you go big.” Yet it is not altogether that simple. Certain Ambani jewels were crafted using the whopper stones, but that is not to suggest that the determining factor in commissioning them was size. “There is tremendous artistry in the work,” said Ms. Volandes of Town & Country. Much of the Ambani jewels were designed by Viren Bhagat, among the more refined high jewelers, though also an assiduously private one. More than the size of individual stones like the stepped-cut emeralds, few save a detective like Mr. Kumar could predict their origins. “Being one-off is of the greatest importance in that world,” Francesca Amfitheatrof, the creative director of high jewelry and watches at Louis Vuitton, said recently from St.-Tropez, France, where she was debuting her latest collection. “To be able to source things that are so unique and outstanding, honestly, only an emperor has that possibility anymore,” she said. “It’s completely maharajah-like. It’s imperial.”",prime minister indira gandhi india abruptly changed country constitution abolished privy purse government allowance country former princely ruler also moved nationalize storied treasury among maharajah nizams nabob ruled subcontinent set frenzy scurried bury family jewel century rarity scale grandeur indian jewel great many became iconic object take patiala necklace tiered ornament resembling drapery gem designed cartier featured astounding diamond centered single rock size walnut consider indore pear two stupendous closely matched diamond owned maharajah yeshwant rao holkar ii glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom central indian state madhya pradesh indian princely patronage long set global standard splendor artistry ostentation jewel trade yet decade privy purse big rock seemed vanished underground legend member formerly royal family stashed jewel swiss vault pawned black market hid flower pot bling royal scale largely disappeared seemed fresh cadre prince heaved view oligarch richest order magnitude mukesh ambani chairman family megacompany reliance industry mr ambanis personal fortune estimated forbes staggering billion despite vast wealth outside india heard march hosted threeday party celebrate son anants wedding july everything prewedding affair princely scale guest list including boldface name like mark zuckerberg bill gate ivanka trump glass palace specially constructed ambanis hometown jamnagar western state gujarat rihannas first public performance year rihannas reported million payday hogged headline lit least one obsessive corner internet ambani jewelry included necklace earring ring hair ornament size grandeur seldom seen publicly since day raj almost like time maharajah year line said pramod kumar archivist founder museum consultancy eka also keeper topophiliaindia erudite instagram account catnip indophile aesthete mr kumars sleuth work traced possible source two gobsmacking gem seen ambani prewedding celebration massive stepcut colombian emerald roughly size popsicle draped one pendant diamond necklace worn one evening bridegroom mother nita ambani bigger one carat mr kumar wrote instagram post adding weight smaller stone mere carat whatever source emerald two among many gem display throughout event jewel often greater star power wearer emerald necklace caught everyones attention first almost unfathomable said stellene volandes editor chief town country noted scarcity represented rope rarest natural pearl arabian sea necklace heavy ornate rani haar style studded diamond headpiece known maang tikka made deep green emerald storied muzo mine youd hardpressed find comparables sheer size horsepower jewel ambani prewedding party said nico landrigan president verdura jewelry house new york indian jewelryobsessed culture category imagine actual wedding bring wedding scheduled july mumbai yet another lavish preparatory celebration opportunity flaunt big rock cruise tyrrhenian sea palermo italy mediterranean cannes france ocean liner whose stateroom retrofitted ambanis threebedroom suite invited guest basically ambanis displaying kind oldstyle hollywood glam said mr kumar eka dont see current billionaire mogul europe america least public realm daniela mascetti former chairwoman sothebys jewelry division europe author understanding jewelry bible trade group aptly compared ambanis robber baron industrial age look back vanderbilt gould also wanted big doorstopper m mascetti said london let put nice way added new money want display wealth go big yet altogether simple certain ambani jewel crafted using whopper stone suggest determining factor commissioning size tremendous artistry work said m volandes town country much ambani jewel designed viren bhagat among refined high jeweler though also assiduously private one size individual stone like steppedcut emerald save detective like mr kumar could predict origin oneoff greatest importance world francesca amfitheatrof creative director high jewelry watch louis vuitton said recently sttropez france debuting latest collection able source thing unique outstanding honestly emperor possibility anymore said completely maharajahlike imperial

nytimes,"India-Pakistan Cricket World Cup Match Brings 34,000 Fans to Long Island","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/nyregion/india-pakistan-cricket-world-cup.html,"Normally at this time of year, the grassy southeastern corner of Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, N.Y., is a place for softball games, family picnics and a few cricket players enjoying a warm weekend afternoon. On Sunday, that space was transformed into a stage for one of the most-watched global sporting events of the year. More than 34,000 fans and cricket dignitaries squeezed into a temporary stadium built in the last three months in the Long Island park to watch the most anticipated match of the T20 Cricket World Cup: India versus Pakistan. For about three hours, fans in blue and orange India shirts mingled with their (vastly outnumbered) rivals in the dark green of Pakistan, producing a festive and vibrant atmosphere. They roared at every big play, shouting and waving signs and flags. They ate South Asian food sold at the concession stands, jumped, chanted, high-fived with fellow supporters and — after a bit of rain — soaked up the sunshine on a historic day at the usually quiet park. “It was electric,” said Chandu Talla, an India fan and entrepreneur from Tampa, Fla., who came to the match with his son Aryan, a high school junior. “We paid $2,500 per ticket and no regrets,” he added. “It was a dream come true to see India here.” After a slow start, India came back strong to win, and when Pakistan’s Naseem Shah hit the last ball from India bowler Arshdeep Singh, the India fans erupted in cheers. “It was pretty good,” said India bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who was named the player of the match. “Always, when India and Pakistan play, a lot of emotion does come in. It did feel like we had a lot of support.” People in the New York area may have been mostly oblivious to it, but any match between India and Pakistan, two of the greatest cricketing nations, is a monumental event, at least in South Asia and other cricket-loving parts of the world. The previous time the teams played, last fall, viewership reached 398 million in India alone, according to the International Cricket Council. (This year’s Super Bowl had 123 million viewers.) Sunday’s attendance (34,028) constituted the largest at an international cricket match in the United States, according to the I.C.C. Attendees included such cricketing legends as Yuvraj Singh of India, Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi and Australia’s Ricky Ponting. For Omar Minaya, the Yankees’ special adviser and the former general manager of the Mets, the cricket match was his first. “It’s amazing,” he said. “The atmosphere is great. It’s like the World Baseball Classic, or the Dominican Baseball League.” The T20 World Cup, held every two years, is a 20-nation tournament featuring a shorter form of cricket. This year, for the first time, the event is being held in the United States and several Caribbean nations where cricket is revered. The U.S. matches are also being held in Dallas and Lauderhill, Fla., but New York was designated for the marquee matchup. Cricket is part of the cultural fabric in both India and Pakistan, but political tensions over the decades have forced the countries to play each other in other places. “Oh, it’s contentious, a real battle of sentiments,” said Narinder Kapoor, 84, a retired U.S. Treasury Department agent, originally from New Delhi. “When these countries play, it’s a real hot potato.” A former amateur cricket player who emigrated to Syosset, N.Y., in 1972, Mr. Kapoor had not seen a cricket match live since 1974, although he watches the sport constantly on TV. He went to the game between Ireland and Canada on Friday and had hoped to attend Sunday’s big encounter, but his knees were ailing him, so he stayed home, according to his son, Sandeep Kapoor. The elder Mr. Kapoor said that he enjoyed the sparsely attended match on Friday, but added that the temporary stadium did not have enough accommodations for people with disabilities and that it was difficult for older people to ascend the steps. “But once you are inside, the field and the view is excellent,” he said. “World class.” Security was tight for the match, especially after a website purportedly affiliated with the terrorist organization ISIS called for attacks on the event. Mounted police, SWAT units, sniffer dogs, helicopters and large numbers of police officers swarmed the area, and long lines formed at entrances as people went through security scanners. Bruce Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, said that the I.C.C. had defrayed some of the cost of the security, which he said included local, state and federal agencies, including the F.B.I. “I want to commend the fans,” Mr. Blakeman said, adding, “Everybody has been so polite and respectful, and they followed instructions so they could be safe and healthy.” There was at least one exception. An airplane trailing a sign that said “Release Imran Khan” breached restricted airspace over the stadium before the match. (Mr. Khan, a former Pakistani cricket star and former prime minister of Pakistan, is serving a prison sentence there.) Mr. Blakeman said the plane was eventually intercepted. The mood at the park was generally upbeat, even for Pakistan fans on the losing end. “India-Pakistan is a very big deal,” said Temu Martin, an airfreight transport official from New Jersey and a Pakistan supporter. “But it’s not war. It’s a game.” He said that after Pakistan lost to the United States last week in a major upset in Dallas, ticket prices for Sunday’s match in East Meadow plummeted from over $2,000 to $600. He said he was planning to travel to Barbados for Pakistan’s next match and then to attend a knockout-stage match in Antigua. There are three more matches scheduled in New York, with the final one on Wednesday between India and the United States. The stadium will then be dismantled and the pieces sent out to other sporting events around the country.

nytimes,"Modi, Striking a Modest Tone, Is Sworn In for a Third Term","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/world/asia/india-changed-modi-swearing-in.html,"As a humbled Narendra Modi was sworn in on Sunday for a third term as India’s prime minister, the political air in New Delhi appeared transformed. The election that ended last week stripped Mr. Modi of his parliamentary majority and forced him to turn to a diverse set of coalition partners to stay in power. Now, these other parties are enjoying something that for years was singularly Mr. Modi’s: relevance and the spotlight. Their leaders have been swarmed by TV crews while on their way to present demands and policy opinions to Mr. Modi. His opponents, too, have been getting more airtime, with stations cutting live to their news conferences, something almost unheard-of in recent years. Above all, the change can be seen in Mr. Modi himself. For now, at least, the messianic air is gone. He pitches himself as the modest administrator that voters showed they wanted. “To run the government, a majority is necessary. But to run the nation, a consensus is necessary,” Mr. Modi said in a speech on Friday to members of his coalition ahead of his swearing in. “The people want us to deliver better than before.” A visibly emotional Mr. Modi took the oath of office on Sunday evening, only the second prime minister to be elected for a third consecutive term in the seven decades of India’s republic. The ceremony, at the country’s presidential palace, was attended by about 8,000 supporters and dignitaries, including the leaders of India’s neighboring nations. To many, Mr. Modi’s shift in approach can mean only good things for the country’s democracy — a move toward moderation in a hugely diverse nation that was being whipped into a Hindu-first monolith in the image of one man. The question is whether Mr. Modi can truly become something he has not been during his two-plus decades in elected office: a consensus builder. “He is a pragmatic politician and, for his own survival and for the survival of his party, he will be a little mellowed,” said Ashutosh, a New Delhi-based analyst who uses only one name and is the author of a book on how Indian politics have changed under Mr. Modi. “But to assume a qualitative change in his style of governance is expecting too much.” A trademark of Mr. Modi’s leadership in recent years has been the use of power levers at his disposal — from pressure of police cases to the lure of a share in power and its perks — to break his opponents and get them to switch to his side. A bruised governing party may well try such tactics to peel away some lawmakers to his side, analyst say, to buttress his place at the top. But in the days leading up to the swearing-in, a change in approach was evident. When members of the new coalition packed into the hall of India’s old Parliament building on Friday for deliberations on forming the government, every time a senior ally seated next to him stood up to start his speech, Mr. Modi also stood up. When it was time for Mr. Modi to be garlanded as the coalition’s choice for prime minister, he waited for the leaders of the two main coalition partners to arrive by his side before the congratulatory wreath of purple orchids was placed around his neck. His hourlong address contained none of his usual references to himself in the third person. His tone was measured. He focused on the coalition’s promise of “good governance” and “the dream of a developed India,” and he acknowledged that things would be different from the past 10 years. The last time Mr. Modi came to the Parliament complex for a closely watched event, last May when he inaugurated a new, more modern building for the assembly, he made an entrance some observers compared with that of a king: with markings on his forehead as a sign of piety and a scepter in his hand, as shirtless, chanting Hindu monks walked ahead of and behind him. This time, he went straight to a copy of the Constitution, which declares that India is a secular and socialist democracy, bowing before it and lifting it to his forehead. For the first time in his more than two decades in elected office, Mr. Modi finds himself in uncharted territory. Until now, as long as he has been at the helm — whether at the state level as the chief minister of Gujarat or at the national level — his Bharatiya Janata Party has always had a majority. Analysts say that history of never having been in the opposition has shaped his heavy-handed approach to politics. When he left Gujarat, after 13 years, he had established such a firm grip and had so routed the opposition that the state had effectively become one of single-party rule. His first national victory in 2014, with a majority for his B.J.P., ended decades of coalition governance in India, in which no party had been able to capture the 272 seats in Parliament necessary for a majority. In 2019, he was re-elected with an even bigger majority. Mr. Modi’s enormous power helped swiftly carry out what had for decades been his right-wing party’s agenda, including construction of a lavish Hindu temple on a long-disputed site that once held a mosque, and the revocation of the special status long enjoyed by the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir. A separatist insurgency has long troubled the Himalayan Kashmir region. As the inauguration ceremony began in New Delhi on Sunday, a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims in the Reasi district fell into a gorge after gunmen opened fire on it. At least eight people were killed, the police said. A trademark of Mr. Modi’s governance was a disregard for parliamentary procedures and for debates on legislation. His unexpected, overnight demonetization in 2016 — which invalidated India’s currency in an effort to crack down on corruption — threw the country into chaos and dealt a blow to a still cash-driven economy. Similarly, rushing to enact laws aimed at overhauling the agriculture market resulted in a year of protests that choked Delhi, forcing Mr. Modi to retreat. Before the election results came out, Mr. Modi’s party had predicted that his coalition would win 400 seats in India’s 543-seat Parliament. The opposition would be reduced to sitting “in the spectators’ gallery,” Mr. Modi said. Officials in his government had made clear that in his new term he would seek to put in place the only main item remaining on his party’s agenda: legislating a “uniform civil code” across this diverse country to replace varying laws of different religions that currently govern issues like marriage and inheritance. His party leaders spoke of Mr. Modi not only as their leader for the current term, but also for the next election in 2029, when he would be 78. “He has been trying to transform the country,” Sudesh Verma, a B.J.P. official who wrote a book on Mr. Modi’s rise, said in an interview before the election results were announced. “I look forward to him working like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, who worked into his 90s.” But under a coalition government, Mr. Modi’s traditional approach will be difficult. Two of the main coalition parties that helped him achieve the minimum number of Parliament seats to form a government are secular, in contrast to Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist ideology. N. Chandrababu Naidu, whose party holds 16 seats, has been scathing in the past in his criticism of Mr. Modi’s treatment of the Muslim minority. He has also openly criticized Mr. Modi for using the central investigating agencies to target his opponents and taking “steps to subvert all democratic institutions.” Neerja Chowdhury, a political analyst in Delhi and the author of the 2023 book “How Prime Ministers Decide,” said, “The contentious ideological issues, like the enactment of the uniform civil code, may be put on the back burner if the allies are not comfortable with it.” Mr. Modi’s popular image is built on two strong pillars. He is a champion of economic development, with an inspiring biography of a rise from a humble caste and relative poverty. He is also a lifelong Hindu nationalist, with decades as a foot soldier in a movement seeking to turn India’s secular and diverse state into an overtly Hindu-first place. At the peak of his power, the Hindu nationalist aspect increasingly dominated. Analysts say that the recent rebuke by voters might be a lucky break for the nation: prompting Mr. Modi to tap into his development champion side, and to focus on a legacy of economic transformation that could improve the lives of all Indians.",humbled narendra modi sworn sunday third term india prime minister political air new delhi appeared transformed election ended last week stripped mr modi

nytimes,"India’s Modi, Humbled by Voters, Faces Potent Economic Struggles","June 7, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/business/india-election-modi-economy.html,"Before the Indian election results emerged this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was widely viewed as a charismatic and popular strongman celebrated by the business world for elevating its importance, even as he failed to solve a vexing problem: how to turn swift economic growth into critically needed jobs. After the election, Mr. Modi finds himself staring at that same monumental puzzle, yet relegated to an uncomfortable new status. He is the head of a party that has been chastened at the polls, forcing him to forge a coalition to maintain power. Mr. Modi’s governing authority is likely to be constrained by the complexities of keeping his coalition partners on his side. He could not solve India’s most deep-seated economic challenge when he wielded a monopolistic hold on power. Now, he is a weakened leader who must balance additional interests, while still lacking an obvious way to improve living standards. “There has been a sense that employment growth has been weak in the last four, five years,” said Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic adviser to the Modi administration, who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “How do you create more jobs? This is really India’s central economic challenge, but I think the government will find itself with relatively limited tools.” The humbling of Mr. Modi’s party resonates in part as an expression of popular frustration that India remains a land of economic peril for hundreds of millions of people, as well as a country defined by astonishing contrasts in wealth. In major cities, five-star hotels boasting sumptuous spas look down on teeming slums that lack plumbing. In rural areas, malnutrition prevails under many roofs, and families struggle to find the money to keep children in school. Though its working-age population numbers roughly one billion, India has only 430 million jobs, according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, an independent research institution in Mumbai. And most of those counted as employed are stuck in precarious circumstances as day laborers and farm hands, lacking reliable wages and government workplace protections. Improved livelihoods are evident in many cities, from the high-rise apartments filling out the horizons to air-conditioned shopping malls and luxury cars choking roads. But the gains are narrowly concentrated. Professionals who work in technology centers in the south of the country and around the capital of New Delhi have enjoyed substantial progress. A rapidly growing domestic auto industry is a source of relatively high-paying jobs. Magnates like Gautam Adani, one of Asia’s richest men, have seen their business empires enhanced by their relationships with Mr. Modi and his willingness to eviscerate regulatory impediments to their greater fortune. But most Indian workers are effectively marooned in the so-called informal sector — laboring at roadside stalls, in small shops and in itinerant trades where they have no guarantee of income or the possibility of advancement. The failure of economic growth to yield more jobs is in large part the story of how India missed out on the manufacturing boom that played out in East Asia over recent decades. From South Korea and China to Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, hundreds of millions of people have escaped poverty via wages earned in factories. India has not shared in that transformation in large part because of a historical focus on self-sufficiency, a disdain for international trade and stultifying bureaucracy that has discouraged investment. “The whole manufacturing thing bypassed India,” Mr. Subramanian, the economist, said. “It’s that bigger development failure that is continuing to haunt India.” Mr. Modi has pursued initiatives aimed at bolstering manufacturing and increasing exports. His administration has streamlined regulations and improved ports. Yet despite some high-profile developments like Apple moving the assembly of some iPhones to India, manufacturing makes up only 13 percent of the country’s economy, according to World Bank data. That is a lower share than a decade ago, when Mr. Modi took office. Foreign money has flowed into India’s stock markets, multiplying share prices, a key element of Mr. Modi’s pro-business image. But persuading international investors to put money directly into Indian companies — a riskier bet — has been a harder sell. His Hindu nationalist party has demonized the Muslim minority, a source of social ferment that has raised fears of instability. The election could further discourage additional investment, because Mr. Modi will likely have a more difficult time gaining passage of stalled reforms sought by business, including laws making it easier to amass land and hire and fire workers. With no clear pathway toward economic dynamism and more challenging political circumstances, Mr. Modi might resort to a time-honored method of shoring up support: He will expand social welfare programs, tapping government coffers to hand out more cash to communities in need. Such a course could potentially diminish available funding for the advancement of the government’s signature program — its aggressive construction of highways, ports, airports and other infrastructure. Those plans are central to maintaining India’s strong economic growth and the broader campaign to encourage investment in manufacturing. Some fear that any short-term pursuit of political favor through the scattering of money could undermine the longer-term project of spurring jobs through the promotion of industry. “You need to ensure that the benefits of economic development reach the maximum number of people,” said Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at Global Data.TS Lombard, a forecasting and consulting firm in London. “If people keep depending on welfare and are not getting the benefits of economic development, then it basically just creates stagnation.” Geopolitical alterations appear to give India a fresh crack at growing its manufacturing base. As the United States and China engage in trade hostilities, multinational brands are seeking to reduce their heavy dependence on Chinese factories to make their goods. Major retailers like Walmart are increasingly looking to India as an alternative to China. But capturing that potential investment demands continued upgrading of highways, rail connections and ports, along with a focus on vocational training to give people the needed skills to take up factory work. Even before the election, there were doubts that Mr. Modi’s administration was moving quickly enough to realize these gains. “India is a counterweight to China in terms of geopolitics, and we will continue to see some of that investment flowing,” Ms. Deveshwar said. “But the scale at which they are provisioning the ecosystem for these opportunities just is not large enough.”",indian election

nytimes,The World Heads to the Polls,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/climate/global-elections-climate-change-policy.html,"One of the busiest election cycles in history is coming to an end on Sunday. Hundreds of millions of people have gone to the polls in South Africa, India and Mexico in recent days, and millions more will do the same in the European Union this weekend. As Somini Sengupta has explained in a series of articles this week, among the issues that the new leaders of these countries will face: how to transition away from coal, how to adapt to record-breaking heat and, in Europe’s case, how to address a growing backlash against environmental policies. Today, I want to lay out some the most pressing environmental challenges in these areas, and what the results announced in the past few days point to. Keep in mind that whatever happens in the United States election in November will affect many of these countries, too. The biggest takeaway from India’s elections, as my colleagues who cover the country put it, is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “lost his aura of invincibility.” His Bharatiya Janata Party still won far more seats than any other party, and Modi is set to take up his third consecutive term as prime minister. But his party didn’t win an outright majority and now needs coalition partners to stay in power. Many critics of the current government see the result as good news for democracy, because Modi will be forced to seek support from more moderate allies. It could also bring some relief to activists like Ritwick Dutta, an environmental lawyer whose efforts to defend nature in India have made him a target of the government. But it’s unclear how fewer seats in Parliament will affect Modi’s environmental policies. The main challenges facing the next Indian government are what to do about the effects of climate change, including heat waves that have killed dozens of people. During the elections, at least 33 poll workers were among them, and the heat also closed schools in several states,",one busiest election cycle history coming end sunday hundred million people gone poll south africa india mexico recent day million european union weekend somini sengupta explained series article week among issue new leader country face transition away coal adapt recordbreaking heat europe case address growing backlash environmental policy today want lay pressing environmental challenge area result announced past day point keep mind whatever happens united state election november affect many country biggest takeaway india election colleague cover country put prime minister narendra modi lost aura invincibility bharatiya janata party still far seat party modi set take third consecutive term prime minister party didnt win outright majority need coalition partner stay power many critic current government see result good news democracy modi forced seek support moderate ally could also bring relief activist like ritwick dutta environmental lawyer whose effort defend nature india made target government unclear fewer seat parliament affect modis environmental policy main challenge facing next indian government effect climate change including heat wave killed dozen people election least poll worker among heat also closed school several state
nytimes,Narendra Modi’s India,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/briefing/modis-india.html,"Narendra Modi has just won re-election as India’s prime minister, though by a far narrower margin than expected. With his third consecutive term, the charismatic strongman has still sealed his position as the country’s most significant leader in generations. Despite having led India for a decade, Modi has in some ways kept his country guessing about his vision. On major issues — India’s relationships, its economy, its society and its government — it’s still unclear what sort of country Modi wants India to be. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain four of the big questions. India has spent recent years deepening its relationship with the United States. It has gotten closer to American allies, including Japan and Australia, and ordered high-end American weapons systems — the kind that create dependence down the road. And it is unlikely to side with China. In 2020, Chinese troops crossed into territory controlled by India and killed 20 soldiers in a skirmish. Modi has kept Beijing at arm’s length since then. But Modi, 73, has signaled that he doesn’t want to be a U.S. ally. Some officials in his inner circle still regard the United States warily. American diplomats complain about New Delhi’s apparent efforts to erode democratic norms and the rights of minority groups. So India keeps its options open. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States tried in vain to persuade India to take a stand against the war. India still processes Russian oil (picking up the slack created by international sanctions). It still buys weapons from Russia. India spent the Cold War trying to position itself as a nonaligned power. Old habits die hard. India recently overtook China as the most populous country and the fastest-growing large economy. Still, most of the country remains poor. Some 800 million people need help filling their stomachs. Modi’s ideas about how to help them can be contradictory — they’re both globally minded and protectionist.",narendra modi reelection india prime minister though far narrower margin expected third consecutive term charismatic strongman still sealed position country significant leader generation despite led india decade modi way kept country guessing vision major issue india relationship economy society government still unclear sort country modi want india today newsletter ill explain four big question india spent recent year deepening relationship united state gotten closer american ally including japan australia ordered highend american weapon system kind create dependence road unlikely side china chinese troop crossed territory controlled india killed soldier skirmish modi kept beijing arm length since modi signaled doesnt want u ally official inner circle still regard united state warily american diplomat complain new delhi apparent effort erode democratic norm right minority group india keep option open russia invaded ukraine united state tried vain persuade india take stand war india still process russian oil picking slack created international sanction still buy weapon russia india spent cold war trying position nonaligned power old habit die hard india recently overtook china populous country fastestgrowing large economy still country remains poor million people need help filling stomach modis idea help contradictory theyre globally minded protectionist
nytimes,"In Global Elections, Strongmen Are Taken Down a Notch","June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/world/global-elections-india-turkey-democracy.html,"In India, a powerful leader wins another term but sees his party’s majority vanish. In South Africa, the governing party is humbled by voters for the first time since the end of apartheid. In Britain, a populist insurgent barges into an election that is shaping up to be a crushing defeat for the long-ruling Conservatives. If there is a common thread halfway through this global year of elections, it is a desire by voters to send a strong signal to the powers that be — if not quite a wholesale housecleaning, then a defiant shake-up of the status quo. Even in Mexico, where Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and the handpicked successor of the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was elected in a landslide last Sunday, voters were rewarding the forces that had uprooted the country’s entrenched establishment only six years earlier. With a billion-plus people going to the polls in more than 60 countries, some analysts had feared that 2024 would pose a fateful test for democracy — one that it might fail. For years, populist and strongmen leaders have chipped away at democratic institutions, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of elections, while social media has swamped voters with disinformation and conspiracy theories. In some of the biggest, most fragile democracies, leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey had been regarded as close to invincible, using appeals to nationalism or sectarianism to mobilize supporters and bending institutions to suit their purposes. Yet now, Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan have both had their wings clipped. Soaring inflation, chronic unemployment and uneven economic growth have widened inequality in India, Turkey and elsewhere, frustrating voters who have shown a willingness to buck the establishment. “We do have electoral systems that are producing outcomes the governing parties didn’t want,” said Ben Ansell, a professor of comparative democratic institutions at the University of Oxford. “They’ve all been destabilized by a tricky economic environment, and behaving like strongmen hasn’t saved them.” Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan remain in power, each now in his third term. But Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., lost dozens of seats and will have to govern in a coalition with two secular parties. Turkey’s opposition struck a blow against Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party in April, winning a string of local elections and solidifying its control of important cities like Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. “In a lot of countries where there’s been talk of backsliding, that’s where we’ve seen a bounce back,” Professor Ansell said. “For Modi and Erdogan, taking the sheen off their infallibility was very important.” With so many elections in so many countries, it is dangerous to generalize. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia rolled up 88 percent of the vote in a landslide re-election victory in March that spoke less to Russian public sentiment and more to the ability of an autocrat, facing no meaningful opposition, to stage-manage a show of support for his war in Ukraine. In Europe, far-right parties are expected to perform well in European Parliament elections, which began on Thursday. Analysts said they did not believe this would jeopardize the political center that has governed Europe in the post-World War II era. And Poland provided a source of reassurance last fall, when voters pushed out its nationalist Law and Justice Party in favor of a more liberal opposition. Still, the success of far-right figures like Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy, attests to the enduring appeal of populism. “Populists and right-wingers will continue to make gains and strike fear into the European political establishment,” the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said in its analysis of the top risks of 2024. Britain’s general election was shaken up on Monday when Nigel Farage, a populist politician, pro-Brexit campaigner and ally of former President Donald J. Trump, announced he would run for a seat in Parliament under the banner of his Reform U.K. party, which has a strident anti-immigration message. That will add to the headache for the Conservative Party, which has lagged the opposition Labour Party by double digits in polls for nearly 18 months. Reform, which is fielding candidates across the country, could siphon off Conservative votes among those who blame the party for a weak economy and rising immigration numbers since Britain left the European Union in 2020. Some critics argue that the Conservative Party’s problems stem from its free-market policies, which they say have disillusioned voters in disadvantaged parts of Britain and set it apart from right-wing parties in Europe or Mr. Trump’s Make America Great Again movement in the United States. More fundamentally, though, the Conservatives have been in power for 14 years, and they face the same pent-up dissatisfaction with the status quo that fueled the recent elections in India, South Africa and Turkey. In some countries, the urge to break with the past has led voters to make unorthodox choices: Javier Milei, a flamboyant libertarian economist, swept to power in Argentina last November with a promise to close its central bank and wage an all-out assault on what he described as a corrupt political “caste.” Some analysts argue that similarly disruptive forces are driving the presidential race in the United States, where a comparatively healthy economy and the advantages of incumbency have not spared President Biden, who faces a neck-and-neck challenge from Mr. Trump even after the former president was convicted of multiple felonies. “It’s not about left versus right, it’s about the status quo versus change,” said Frank Luntz, an American political strategist who has lived and worked in Britain. “You can’t buy a house in the U.K., the N.H.S. doesn’t work,” he said, referring to the National Health Service. “In the United States, you can’t afford housing or health care. It’s about broken promises, year after year after year.” That sense of betrayal is even more acute in countries like South Africa, where the African National Congress, or A.N.C., has governed since the start of democracy there in 1994, piling up majorities even as the economy and social infrastructure crumbled. Last week, voters finally rebelled, driving down the A.N.C.’s vote share to 40 percent, from 58 percent in the last national election in 2019. Among their biggest complaints is the lack of job opportunities: South Africa’s unemployment rate — at 42 percent, including those who have stopped looking for work — is one of the highest in the world. Stagnation has widened the country’s already profound inequality. South Africans flock to cities looking for work. But many end up in decrepit buildings and slapdash shack communities, often without running water or sanitary toilets. Regular power outages leave streets dark and residents of many communities vulnerable to crime. South Africa’s murder rate is six and a half times as high as that of the United States and 45 times as high as Germany’s. Jacob Zuma, the scandal-scarred former president, has benefited from this misery, helping start a new party, umKhonto weSizwe, or M.K., which won nearly 15 percent of the vote, mostly at the expense of his former party, the A.N.C. Mr. Zuma attracts a feverish following among disillusioned A.N.C. supporters, who accuse the party of selling out to wealthy white businesspeople and not moving aggressively enough to redistribute wealth to the Black majority after apartheid. India’s election was a comparable anti-incumbent revolt, even if Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. is still the largest party in Parliament by a wide margin. The party’s campaign spending was at least 20 times as much as that of its main opposition, the Congress Party, which had its bank accounts frozen by the government in a tax dispute on the eve of the election. The country’s news outlets have been largely bought off or bullied into silence. And yet, the results showed Mr. Modi, 73, losing his majority for the first time since he took office in 2014. Analysts said that reflected widespread dissatisfaction with how the fruits of India’s economy have been shared. While India’s steady growth has made it the envy of its neighbors — and created a conspicuous billionaire class — those riches have not flowed to the hundreds of millions of India’s poor. The government has handed out free rations of wheat, grain and cooking gas. It offers home water connections, subsidizes building supplies and gives farmers cash. But it has not tackled India’s inflation or unemployment, leaving hundreds of millions of people, especially women, chronically out of work. There is also some evidence that Mr. Modi’s appeals to Hindu nationalism were not as potent as in previous elections. The B.J.P.’s candidate did not even win the constituency that is home to the lavish Ram temple, built on grounds disputed by Hindus and Muslims. Mr. Modi inaugurated the temple just before the campaign started, hoping it would galvanize his Hindu political base. The economy figured into Mexico’s election as well, but in a very different way. While overall growth was disappointing — averaging only 1 percent a year during Mr. López Obrador’s term — the government doubled the minimum wage and strengthened the peso, lifting millions of Mexicans out of poverty. “People vote with their wallets, and it’s very obvious there’s more money in the wallets of almost everybody in Mexico,” said Diego Casteñeda Garza, a Mexican economist and historian at Uppsala University in Sweden. Still, analysts said, there was also a desire among voters to cement the change that Mr. López Obrador, a charismatic outsider, symbolized when he came to power in 2018. Even as Ms. Sheinbaum, 61, vowed to continue her mentor’s policies, she cast herself — Mexico’s first female and Jewish president — as a change agent. For Jacqueline González, 33, who works at a cargo transportation company and viewed Mexico’s previous governments as corrupt, that made voting for Ms. Sheinbaum an easy decision. “With Obrador we have already seen, although some people don’t want to admit it, some change,” Ms. González said. “Let’s hope it continues with Sheinbaum.”",india powerful leader win another term see party majority vanish

nytimes,"Rahul Gandhi, Long on the Ropes, Looks Set for an Unexpected Comeback","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-congress-rahul-gandhi.html,"Just last year, Rahul Gandhi and the once-powerful party he led, the Indian National Congress, seemed to be on the ropes and little threat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s consolidation of political power. Congress had not been a competitive factor in national elections in years, winning fewer and fewer votes each time Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party was elected. And Mr. Gandhi himself had been convicted on a slander charge and barred from holding a seat in Parliament. But on Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi and a broad opposition coalition led by his Congress party registered a far stronger showing than expected in India’s elections, setting the stage for an unlikely comeback. “He has finally arrived,” said Rasheed Kidwai, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi. “This time he has improved his vote share by at least 17 million votes, which is very substantial.” On Wednesday, Mr. Modi’s party announced that it had reached an agreement to form a governing coalition, including two parties that do not necessarily share its vision. Congress won 99 seats in the 543-seat Parliament, a gain of 47 seats, and the alliance of which it is the leading part won a total of 232. Congress and its alliance of over two dozen political groups have presented the results as a “moral victory” over a B.J.P. government that they say was trying to change the country’s Constitution and have portrayed as anathema to India’s identity as a multifaith and secular country. “The fight was to save the Constitution,” Mr. Gandhi, the son, grandson and great-grandson of Congress prime ministers, said as the results poured in. The first major sign that Congress might be able to contend came in May 2023, just a couple of months after Mr. Gandhi’s conviction for slander, when his party won the state government of Karnataka, in the south of India, from the B.J.P. The lift was temporary; Congress soon lost power in three states it governed to the B.J.P. But at the same time, political experts say, Mr. Gandhi was pushing for changes within the party, India’s oldest, which had long resisted overhauling an archaic organizational structure that kept its top leaders isolated from the grass-roots workers who deliver votes. Feelings that Congress’s leaders were corrupt and out of touch resulted in a string of defeats over a number of years and then degenerated into messy infighting within the party. For the past two years, party members say, Mr. Gandhi has tried to reverse the decline of Congress by surrounding himself with young policy analysts to help him understand the challenges facing India, as well as party veterans with their ears to the ground in towns and villages that Congress was targeting. The party has in addition improved its social media game, trumpeting its messages on platforms like WhatsApp and YouTube. Mr. Gandhi also raised his profile by embarking on two walks across India — meeting farmers in their fields and vegetable sellers on city streets; and drinking tea with recent graduates and gig workers — in an effort to show common cause with ordinary people. Perhaps most important, Congress focused on a strategy of reaching out to and cooperating with key regional players across the country whose influence had dimmed under B.J.P. rule. Congress leaders made a series of “seat-sharing” agreements with regional leaders, big and small, that strengthened the alliance against Mr. Modi’s party. To avoid splitting the anti-B.J.P. vote, Congress had its own candidates contest fewer seats. And Mr. Gandhi campaigned vigorously alongside the leaders of like-minded political groups across India. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Gandhi also won support, party leaders say, by characterizing Mr. Modi as a leader who would destroy India’s secular character. “It is a victory not just for him and our alliance partners but for the millions of poor Indians who voted to protect the secular fabric of this country,” said Srinivas B.V., another Congress leader, about Mr. Gandhi. “People showed Modi: ‘You are not God, and you can be replaced.’” Since being voted to power in 2014, Mr. Modi has sought to position Hinduism, the religion of some 80 percent of Indians, at the center of the country’s official identity. He also promised to end corruption, overhaul the economy and help India become a “developed nation” by 2047. But after his re-election in 2019, he leaned into Hindu themes to a greater extent. Mr. Gandhi’s efforts to contrast his vision for India with Mr. Modi’s largely paid off, analysts say, even if some members of his party jumped ship and sided with the B.J.P. Many of the politicians who defected from Congress to the B.J.P. lost their seats, including in West Bengal and Maharashtra, where Congress and its partners did especially well. Throughout the campaign Mr. Gandhi persistently linked Mr. Modi with Gautam Adani, Asia’s richest man, saying the prime minister was working for his tycoon friends, not for the vast majority of Indians who are poor. As if to vindicate this line of attack, over the two days after the election results were announced, the price of Mr. Adani’s flagship stock fell by 14 percent. (It then recovered somewhat on Wednesday.) “People directly correlate Adani Ji with Modi Ji — directly,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters after the results, using Hindi honorifics for the two men. Researchers who traveled across India during the voting said Mr. Gandhi had beaten Mr. Modi on his own turf in many places by focusing on issues like the millions of Indians without jobs and the economic difficulties faced by farmers. He also accused the B.J.P. of governance failures and worked with local political groups fighting for social justice and for the empowerment of lower-caste Indians. Uttar Pradesh, where Mr. Modi made dozens of visits to campaign for local candidates, is one state where the changing fortunes of the two largest political groupings was evident. The state is India’s largest, and accounts for 80 of the Parliament’s 543 seats. The B.J.P. recorded its worst performance there since 2009, in part because Mr. Gandhi was able to craft an alliance with a powerful local leader, Akhilesh Yadav. In addition to the 37 seats picked up by Mr. Yadav’s Samajwadi Party, Congress won six, helped by aggressive campaigning by Mr. Gandhi’s sister, Priyanka Vadra, who helped defeat a former soap-opera actress who had served as a minister in Mr. Modi’s government. The B.J.P. won 33 seats, down from 62 in the previous Parliament. The election results announced on Wednesday have given a major lift to hundreds of thousands of Congress workers across the country, who were growing tired of the internal infighting that has plagued their party for years. Outside Congress headquarters in New Delhi, Bansi Lal Meena, a veteran Congress member from the state of Rajasthan, was exultant about his party’s performance. “In villages and on the ground, the B.J.P. spread lies for years against us — saying that we are anti-Hindu,” he said. “They used my religion as a weapon against me to win votes.” He added: “We will show them now because our people are also in Parliament.”",last year rahul gandhi oncepowerful party led indian national congress seemed rope little threat prime minister narendra modis consolidation political power congress competitive

nytimes,Narendra Modi Fell to Earth After Making It All About Himself,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-election-modi.html,"When everything became about Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, his party and its century-old Hindu-nationalist network were propelled to unimagined heights. On the back of his singular charisma and political skill, a onetime-fringe religious ideology was pulled to the center of Indian life. Landslide election victories remade India’s politics, once dominated by diverse coalitions representing a nation that had shaped its independence on secular principles. But there were always risks in wrapping a party’s fortunes so completely in the image of one man, in inundating a country of many religions, castes and cultures with that leader’s name, face and voice. Voters could start to think that everything was about him, not them. They could even revolt. On Tuesday, Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., fell back to earth. After having promised their biggest election romp yet, they lost more than 60 seats. Mr. Modi will remain in office for a third term, but only with the help of a contentious coalition of parties, some of which are opposed to his core beliefs and want power of their own. With the result, India’s strained democracy appeared to roar back to life, its beaten-down political opposition reinvigorated. And after a decade in which Mr. Modi’s success in entrenching Hindu supremacy had often felt like the new common sense, India is seeing its leader and itself in a new light, and trying to understand this unexpected turn. Most fundamentally, the opposition, newly coalesced for what it called a do-or-die moment as Mr. Modi increasingly tilted the playing field, found a way to use the cult of personality around him to its advantage. Opposition leaders focused on bread-and-butter issues, often at granular levels in particular constituencies. They hammered Mr. Modi over persistent unemployment and stark inequality. But the B.J.P., with Mr. Modi from on high its only spokesman, was often left with just one answer: Trust in “Modi’s guarantee.” “The ‘Modi’s guarantee’ slogan turned out to be our undoing,” said Ajay Singh Gaur, a B.J.P. worker who had campaigned in the party stronghold of Uttar Pradesh, the northern state where Mr. Modi suffered his biggest blow on Tuesday, losing nearly half of the B.J.P. seats. “The opposition made that sound like this was not about him having delivered, or trying to deliver,” Mr. Gaur said, “but about him being an arrogant politician.” Mr. Modi gave his adversaries a lot to work with, even declaring that he may not be “biological” and that he had been sent by God. He has still emerged better so far than other Indian leaders who deeply centralized power. He remains in control of levers of power that could help him and his party restore their dominance. Indira Gandhi, who had also glorified herself and went so far as to suspend India’s democracy after declaring a national emergency, was voted out at the peak of her powers before returning three years later. But Mr. Modi’s B.J.P., the world’s largest political party, finds itself in a tough spot after years of centralization and reliance on a government machinery put to the service of one man, analysts say. The huge advantage the party has built in numbers and resources is undercut by a lack of internal consultation and delegation of authority. That was a key reason for its failure in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, with 240 million people, and surrounding states. Local B.J.P. leaders were disenchanted by a top-down approach toward choosing candidates, as well as what they called a misguided belief that Mr. Modi’s popularity could allow the party to sidestep potent local issues and caste factors. With Mr. Modi sucking up all the oxygen at the top, other senior leaders of the party have been left to fight for relevance and a voice. His relentless self-promotion has also alienated the leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., the B.J.P.’s right-wing fountainhead. During election seasons, the R.S.S. activates its vast grass-roots network in support of B.J.P. candidates. While Mr. Modi, a former foot soldier in the organization, has advanced many of its goals, his consolidation of power goes against its regimented nature and its focus on ideology over individual personalities. One R.S.S. insider, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking, said that Mr. Modi’s exalting of himself had created such resentment inside the group that some of its leaders welcomed any sort of reality check for him, short of his ouster. Sudheendra Kulkarni, a political analyst who served as an aide to the first B.J.P. prime minister in the 1990s, said Mr. Modi had pushed through unpopular legislation — in particular farm laws that prompted a yearlong protest that choked New Delhi — without consulting with party officials in the affected states. They were left to cope with the ramifications. “The B.J.P. was never a one-leader party,” Mr. Kulkarni said. “All that changed with Narendra Modi in 2014. He sought to promote a new authoritarian idea of one nation, one leader.” Hypothesizing that Mr. Modi’s popularity had peaked, the opposition saw an opening to go after a decisive section of votes in the Indian political formula. For decades before his rise in 2014, neither the B.J.P. nor the Indian National Congress, the country’s two largest parties, could muster majorities on its own. Mr. Modi expanded his party’s backing by consolidating right-wing Hindu voters and drawing in new supporters with his personal story of a humble caste and economic background and a promise to change lives through robust development. A decade later, in this year’s election, the opposition found traction in painting a very different picture of Mr. Modi — as an autocratic friend of billionaires. Since Mr. Modi had achieved everything he had set out to do, the opposition argued, his pursuit of a resounding majority could only mean that he would seek radical change to the Constitution. That claim stirred anxiety among India’s Dalits and other underprivileged groups, who see the Constitution as their only protection in a deeply unequal society, guaranteeing them a share of government jobs and seats in higher education as well as elected bodies. The opposition was able to push the message harder when some in Mr. Modi’s right-wing support base, long seen as having an upper-caste bias, called for revoking the quotas. Caste identity was a major driving factor for voters in many states, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, with its 80 parliamentary seats. The decline of a Dalit party in the state meant that about 20 percent of the votes were potentially up for grabs. In Ayodhya, the constituency where Mr. Modi inaugurated a grand Ram temple earlier this year in an effort to consolidate his Hindu support base, the opposition put up a Dalit candidate. He handily defeated the B.J.P.’s two-term incumbent. In other cases, voters showed their anger over the B.J.P.’s perceived sense of impunity. In Kheri, a constituency where the son of a B.J.P. minister rammed his S.U.V. into a crowd of protesting farmers, killing several, the minister also lost. Mr. Modi’s election campaign took its most divisive turn in Banswara, in the desert state of Rajasthan, where he called India’s 200 million Muslims “infiltrators” and raised fears that the opposition would give them India’s wealth, including Hindu women’s necklaces. Banswara’s B.J.P. incumbent was routed in the election. While the loss was most likely attributable to local issues, the national discussion noted that Mr. Modi’s comments had not helped. In his own constituency of Varanasi, in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Modi’s winning margin of nearly half a million votes in 2019 shrank to about 150,000 — a disappointing showing after he had dispatched some of the B.J.P.’s most senior leaders to camp out there to help him achieve an even bigger victory. Jai Prakash, a tea and samosa seller in Varanasi, said some of the prime minister’s work, particularly his improvement of roads, was popular. But Mr. Modi was losing the plot, Mr. Prakash said, by turning to issues disconnected from people’s day-to-day lives. “Prices are skyrocketing; so is unemployment,” Mr. Prakash said. “He has done some good. But people cannot worship him endlessly.”",everything became prime minister narendra modi india party centuryold hindunationalist network propelled unimagined height back singular charisma political

nytimes,"India Keeps Its Glorious, Messy Tradition Alive","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/opinion/india-election-modi-bjp-democracy.html,"Back in January, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India looked all but unstoppable, he visited the small city of Ayodhya for the unofficial start of his campaign to win a third term. The location was freighted with symbolism. For decades, Hindu nationalists had sought to build a temple in Ayodhya, at a spot they believe to be the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. The only problem was that there was already a house of worship on the spot, a mosque built by a Mughal emperor in 1528. A Hindu mob had dismantled the mosque in 1992, setting off riots that killed 2,000 people, most of them Muslims. The ruins were a flashpoint of religious tensions in India for decades. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party promised to build the temple, and the lavish event at which Modi officially opened it was a showcase for that achievement. At the time it seemed like strong election-year messaging for a politician who built his career on the twin planks of Hindu nationalism and building a muscular new India. Unlike other politicians, the event implied, Modi made promises and kept them. “It is the beginning of a new era,” he declared. Feeling supremely confident, Modi had boldly asked the Indian electorate for something akin to a blank check to remake the country — control of 400 seats in Parliament in elections that began in April and concluded on June 1. And why shouldn’t he have been confident? India’s economy was the fastest-growing in the world. India had overtaken China as the world’s most-populous country. World leaders sought Modi’s support on issues ranging from the war in Ukraine to the climate crisis, cementing India’s ascent in global affairs. But the ever unpredictable electorate of the world’s largest democracy responded to Modi’s demand for still more power resolutely: No thanks. In a stunning rebuke, election results released on Tuesday showed that India’s voters have reduced the parliamentary share of Modi’s party by more than 60 seats, not enough for an outright majority, never mind the supermajority he had sought. It struck me as particularly apt that despite all the fanfare about the glorious new temple in Ayodhya, Modi’s party lost the city’s parliamentary seat to a political opposition that had been all but left for dead. There appears to be a clear ceiling to the appeals to Hindu identity on its own. “We are very happy with the temple, but people were fed up with the B.J.P.,” a local business leader, Rakesh Yadav, told Reuters. “People will not always fall for the caste or temple-mosque politics. They also want to see development.” This is a big year for democracy, almost a referendum of sorts on the very idea. Dozens of countries are holding elections, representing roughly half of the world’s population. But authoritarianism has been on the march. The latest report from Freedom House found that by many measures, global freedom has declined for the 18th straight year. India, despite its status as the world’s most-populous democracy, has been a poster child for this decline under Modi: His government has taken aim at just about every form of freedom. He has attacked and grievously weakened the independence of India’s once boisterous press. He has jailed critics and political opponents. He has sharpened religious animosity, referring during this campaign to Muslims, who make up 14 percent of India’s population, as “infiltrators” who seek to steal wealth and power from the Hindu majority. It’s an Indian edition of the nationalist, populist playbook playing out around the world. That a newly unified opposition managed to prevent Modi’s party from winning an outright majority under these conditions took everyone, including me, by surprise. And it suggests that even when would-be authoritarians attempt to tilt the playing field, voters can and will state their will, no matter the autocrat’s preferences. “The B.J.P. had positioned itself as a new hegemonic power,” Yamini Aiyar, a scholar and analyst of Indian democracy who has been a frequent target of Hindu nationalist rage, told me. “The beauty of an election is that politicians have to go to the people, and the people get an opportunity to express their anxieties and their perspectives.” Express them they did. Looking back, the weakness of the B.J.P.’s re-election case is clear: Yes, India’s economy was growing fast. But despite the flashy new infrastructure projects and deals to increase high-tech manufacturing, the growth was not creating nearly enough jobs, and inflation remained stubbornly high, especially for food, which hits the poorest hardest. Much of the wealth generated by growth has gone to India’s richest tycoons, and inequality has soared. “The reality is that the real economy has been hurting for a very long time, and they have systematically sought to ignore it,” Aiyar said. India has managed to lift millions of people out of poverty since Modi came to power 10 years ago, but particularly in rural areas, where most Indians live, that has meant social welfare rather than jobs. There were other issues too — Modi’s allies had floated the idea of changing India’s Constitution in various ways, including removing its commitment to secularism and enshrining Hinduism as the national faith. These kinds of appeals have helped the B.J.P. in the past but seem to have had less power this time around. One clear sign was its heavy losses in Uttar Pradesh, which is not just India’s most populous state; it is also part of the heavily Hindu heartland of northern India. It also seems that the opposition may finally have gotten its act together. India’s main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, has been in decline for years and had struggled to make common cause with other opposition parties in previous elections. But this year the opposition parties managed to make a much stronger coalition. They focused on kitchen table issues and highlighted the Modi government’s ties to big business and high-flying billionaires. The opposition didn’t shy away from making the stakes for Indian democracy clear. But the relentless focus on what voters said mattered most offers lessons for those battling revanchist movements elsewhere, including in the United States. Sometimes you need to meet voters where they are. This vote wasn’t a total rebuke of Modi and his policies. He is all but certain to get his third term as prime minister by making a coalition with allied parties. But it is a clear and salutary check on his authoritarian project. This election is also a rebuke of Indian elites — in business and media especially — who had willingly surrendered to a kind of inevitability of Modi’s long-term consolidation of power, making peace with it or even celebrating it. Activists, analysts and journalists who had the temerity to speak plainly about Modi’s revanchist project and the threat he posed to the world’s biggest democracy and its long history of tolerance, secularism and free speech have been hounded out of public life. I hope that this troubling slide ends now. As the results rolled in on Tuesday, I remembered my own reporting trip to Ayodhya in 2009, when I was a correspondent for The Times based in India. An explosive new government report had just been issued about the destruction of the mosque and the role of Hindu nationalist groups in stirring up violence. But when I got there, I was surprised to find that on the hotly contested spot itself there was hardly any hoopla. The crowds of Hindu nationalist volunteers who for years had routinely shown up to build the temple with their bare hands had disappeared. India was going through a period of hopeful prosperity. Voters had just returned the Indian National Congress party and its allies to power with a larger majority, and a brilliant, teetotaling economist named Manmohan Singh was prime minister. With the future looking so alluring, no one seemed all that interested in litigating the past. These hopes were ultimately dashed amid scandals over political corruption and mismanagement. The Congress party, which once seemed unstoppable, lost power in 2014 for failing to deliver on its promise to bring India to its long-awaited place among the world’s richest and most powerful nations. The years ahead will, with any luck, be ones of negotiation and compromise. This will be a return to form for India, a vastly diverse nation whose unruly polity has resisted autocracy at every turn since it shrugged off British colonial rule in 1947. The whole world should breathe a sigh of relief that India’s voters have spoken, loudly, in favor of continuing that glorious, messy tradition.",back january prime minister narendra modi india looked

nytimes,The New Kingmakers Who Could Make or Break Modi’s Government,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-elections-modi-coalition.html,"After his first two national election victories, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India easily set his own terms, with his Bharatiya Janata Party winning clear majorities. The result was different in this vote. It was still a victory, but one that left him dependent on a host of coalition partners — particularly on politicians from two regional parties who could make or break Mr. Modi’s ability to form a government. Of the more than a dozen parties that make up the B.J.P.’s coalition, known as the National Democratic Alliance, most won just one or two seats, leaving the party in a difficult predicament. On Wednesday, the B.J.P. said it had reached an agreement to form a coalition government that includes those two regional parties — the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United. They will be the biggest junior partners, but they are also avowedly secular and removed from Mr. Modi’s Hindu-nationalist ideology. Cameras on Wednesday followed every word, meeting and movement of the leaders of the two parties, N. Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party, and Nitish Kumar of Janata Dal-United. Their combined 28 seats in Parliament will give the prime minister the votes he needs to stay in power and push through his agenda. Here is what to know about the men who unexpectedly found themselves as kingmakers, and about the parties they lead. Though some of the members of the B.J.P.’s coalition this year share Mr. Modi’s hard-line vision, both the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United are moderate, secular parties that have a diverse support base. Speculation in India was focusing on what terms the men were demanding for their support, which are unlikely to be rooted in ideology. Both Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar are known to be pragmatic, deal-making politicians whose priorities will be practical concessions for their state, or perhaps cabinet positions. Mr. Kumar has earned a reputation in India for his willingness to switch allegiances over the past decade. He has gone between aligning himself with the B.J.P.-led coalition to supporting its rivals no fewer than five times. Most recently, in January, he returned to Mr. Modi’s alliance just 18 months after he’d left it and with just months to go until the election. He has said his switching of political loyalties was in the interest of his state, Bihar. Mr. Naidu has also at times broken with Mr. Modi, cutting ties with the B.J.P. in 2018 and joining forces with its chief rival, Indian National Congress, ahead of the 2019 elections. He has said that his party has aligned with the B.J.P. out of “political compulsion.” Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar have both been in politics for decades, and have been mentioned as potential candidates for prime minister. Mr. Naidu of the T.D.P., based in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, is a technocrat who has aggressively pushed for investment from information technology companies in his region. His policies helped bring high-paying jobs for I.T. professionals and transformed the city of Hyderabad. Mr. Kumar is a nine-time chief minister of Bihar, India’s poorest state, who comes from a homegrown socialist background. He has pushed for more funds for low-caste Hindus, and his alliance with the B.J.P. broadened support for the party in his state.",first two national election victory prime minister narendra modi india easily set term bharatiya janata party winning clear majority result different vote still victory one left dependent host coalition partner particularly politician two regional party could make break mr modis ability form government dozen party make bjps coalition known national democratic alliance one two seat leaving party difficult predicament wednesday bjp said reached agreement form coalition government includes two regional party telugu desam party janata dalunited biggest junior partner also avowedly secular removed mr modis hindunationalist ideology camera wednesday followed every word meeting movement leader two party n chandrababu naidu telugu desam party nitish kumar janata dalunited combined seat parliament give prime minister vote need stay power push agenda know men unexpectedly found kingmaker party lead though member bjps coalition year share mr modis hardline vision telugu desam party janata dalunited moderate secular party diverse support base speculation india focusing term men demanding support unlikely rooted ideology mr naidu mr kumar known pragmatic dealmaking politician whose priority practical concession state perhaps cabinet position mr kumar earned reputation india willingness switch allegiance past decade gone aligning bjpled coalition supporting rival fewer five time recently january returned mr modis alliance month hed left month go election said switching political loyalty interest state bihar mr naidu also time broken mr modi cutting tie bjp joining force chief rival indian national congress ahead election said party aligned bjp political compulsion mr naidu mr kumar politics decade mentioned potential candidate prime minister mr naidu tdp based southern state andhra pradesh technocrat aggressively pushed investment information technology company region policy helped bring highpaying job professional transformed city hyderabad mr kumar ninetime chief minister bihar india poorest state come homegrown socialist background pushed fund lowcaste hindu alliance bjp broadened support party state
nytimes,"Modi se reelige en India, pero pierde mayoría parlamentaria: 4 claves de las elecciones","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/06/05/espanol/elecciones-india-modi.html,"[Estamos en WhatsApp. Empieza a seguirnos ahora] La primera década de Narendra Modi como primer ministro de India ha estado plagada de sorpresas. Ninguna, sin embargo, se comparó con lo que ocurrió el martes por la mañana, cuando Modi ganó su segunda reelección, pero su partido perdió la mayoría en el Parlamento. Con esa derrota, el aire de invencibilidad de Modi también pareció desvanecerse por primera vez desde que asumió el cargo en 2014. Los resultados de las elecciones fueron particularmente interesantes porque, tras casi siete semanas de votaciones en todo el país, las encuestas a pie de urna publicadas pocos días antes del recuento final mostraban que el Partido Popular Indio de Modi ganaría de forma aplastante, como ya había hecho en dos ocasiones anteriores. Sin embargo, el Partido Popular Indio solo obtuvo 239 escaños, muy por debajo de los 272 necesarios para formar gobierno. La alianza de la oposición, liderada por el Partido del Congreso Nacional Indio, obtuvo 235 escaños. Con los 52 escaños obtenidos por los aliados del Partido Popular Indio, Modi seguirá a la cabeza. Pero su atractivo ha disminuido y su liderazgo ha cambiado radicalmente. Cuando Modi llegó al poder en 2014, prometió progreso económico, el fin de la corrupción y la promoción del hinduismo como elemento central de la identidad india. Con todo ello, se presentó como un líder singularmente fuerte, capaz de reunir a sus seguidores para trabajar por la nación. Esto contrastaba con el gobierno anterior. Antes de que Modi fuera elegido por primera vez, India llevaba 25 años gobernada por coaliciones. Los primeros ministros del Partido del Congreso, del Partido Popular Indio y de terceros partidos más pequeños se alternaban para dirigir India por comités. Modi rompió con esa tradición y lideró un nuevo sistema de partido único dominado por el Partido Popular Indio. Como líder, Modi mostró poco interés en compartir el poder. Cuando invalidó la mayor parte del papel moneda de India en 2016, ni siquiera su ministro de Finanzas conocía la decisión de antemano. Cuando decidió imponer la ley marcial en Jammu y Cachemira, el único estado de mayoría musulmana de India, presentó el plan al Parlamento como un hecho, sin pedir su aprobación. Pero esos días han terminado. Los dos mayores partidos que han surgido como nuevos socios de coalición del Partido Popular Indio están liderados por N. Chandrababu Naidu y Nitish Kumar, legisladores veteranos a quienes se conoce como tecnócratas moderados. Es probable que ambos exijan más autoridad en el Parlamento. De hecho, ambos han sido señalados como posibles candidatos a primer ministro, si se produjera otra coalición que no estuviera liderada ni por el Partido Popular Indio ni por el Congreso Nacional Indio. Cuando el martes se dieron a conocer los primeros mapas electorales nacionales que mostraban el número de escaños ganados y perdidos en el Parlamento, se observó una nueva y sorprendente configuración. Los mapas mostraban que el partido de Modi había perdido zonas de territorio en los estados del norte de habla hindi, considerados bastiones del Partido Popular Indio. Al mismo tiempo, el su partido avanzó en regiones que se habían resistido a Modi en el pasado. Perdió decenas de escaños en el estado septentrional de Uttar Pradesh, pero ganó muchos en el estado oriental de Odisha y en el estado meridional de Telangana. La única parte del país que ahora parece unificada por un partido es el “cinturón tribal”, que atraviesa los estados centrales. Sus comunidades relativamente pobres han sido hábilmente puestas en la mira de la política hinduista y los beneficios sociales del Partido Popular Indio. Los inversores de los mercados bursátiles indios de Mumbai respondieron con entusiasmo a las primeras encuestas a pie de urna. El lunes, se lanzaron a la compra, haciendo subir los precios de las llamadas acciones de Modi, aquellas asociadas a las prioridades de gasto del primer ministro o que se cree que se benefician de sus políticas fiscales. Cuando se conocieron los resultados de las urnas, esas acciones se desplomaron. Las acciones del buque insignia del Grupo Adani perdieron cerca del 19 por ciento de su valor en un solo día de cotización. El índice bursátil perdió cerca del 6 por ciento, casi anulando las ganancias de los cinco primeros meses del año. Modi sigue siendo popular entre los magnates de India, pero los inversores deben averiguar qué empresas se beneficiarán del nuevo gobierno. Chris Wood, responsable mundial de estrategia de renta variable del banco de inversión Jefferies, advirtió el año pasado que si Modi perdía, “cabría esperar una corrección del 25 por ciento, si no más”, en el mercado bursátil indio. Históricamente, a las empresas indias les ha ido igual de bien durante los periodos de gobierno de coalición. Por lo tanto, Wood dijo que, incluso sin Modi en el poder, espera que las acciones “se recuperen bruscamente” sobre la base de la fortaleza de la economía del país en su conjunto. Esta nueva era en el Parlamento empezará seguramente con algunas rondas de retribuciones políticas. Los políticos que no hayan conseguido escaños para sus jefes serán despedidos. Es probable que los partidos más pequeños exijan puestos en el gabinete, lo que significará sustituir a miembros del Partido Popular Indio. Habrá que revisar las políticas. ¿Se inclinará India por la exportación de manufacturas, con el objetivo de sustituir a China como la fábrica del mundo? ¿Protegerá ahora a las industrias locales que temen la competencia extranjera? Milan Vaishnav, investigador de la Fundación Carnegie para la Paz Internacional, advirtió que India no puede volver exactamente a la política de coalición que precedió a Modi. Es probable que sus nuevos socios exijan un estilo autoritario similar al que Modi ejerce desde Nueva Delhi. El tipo de líderes estatales que necesita ahora como socios de coalición “son tan absolutistas como el gobierno nacional”, dijo Vaishnav. Podrían, por ejemplo, pedir a la policía federal que detuviera a sus oponentes, como ha hecho Modi. Las elecciones de India fueron las mayores celebradas en la historia de la democracia, con más de 600 millones de votantes en seis fases. Esta vez no hubo quejas sobre las máquinas de votación electrónica, ni temores de que India se hubiera convertido en una dictadura bajo el mandato de Modi. En un discurso difícil pronunciado el martes por la noche desde la sede del Partido Popular Indio, Modi calificó las elecciones de “celebración de la democracia”.",estamos en whatsapp empieza

nytimes,Modi Struggles to Stay on Top: 4 Takeaways From India’s Election,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-election-2024-takeaways.html,"Narendra Modi’s first decade as India’s prime minister came with its fair share of surprises. None, however, looked anything like what happened on Tuesday morning when he won his second re-election, but lost his party’s majority in Parliament. With that loss, Mr. Modi’s air of invincibility also appeared to be fading for the first time since he took office in 2014. The election results were especially shocking because, after nearly seven sweaty weeks of voting across the country, exit polls released just days before the final tally showed that Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party would win in a landslide, as it had twice before. Instead, the Bharatiya Janata Party won only 240 seats, well short of the 272 needed to form a government. The opposition alliance, led by the Indian National Congress Party, took 235 seats. With the 52 seats won by B.J.P. allies, Mr. Modi will remain on top. But his allure has been diminished, and his leadership has fundamentally changed. When Mr. Modi came to power in 2014, he promised economic progress, an end to corruption and to promote Hinduism as being central to India’s identity. Through it all, he presented himself as a uniquely strong leader, capable of marshaling his followers to work for the nation. This was in contrast to the previous government. Before Mr. Modi was first elected, India spent 25 years being governed by coalitions. Prime ministers from the Congress Party, the B.J.P. and smaller third parties took turns running India by committee. Mr. Modi broke with that tradition, leading a new single-party system dominated by the B.J.P. As leader, Mr. Modi showed little interest in sharing power. When he invalidated most of India’s paper currency in 2016, not even his finance minister knew about the decision in advance. When he decided to impose de facto martial law on Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state, he presented the plan to Parliament as a done deal, without seeking approval. But those days are over. The two biggest parties that have emerged as the B.J.P.’s new coalition partners are led by N. Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar, veteran lawmakers who are known as technocratic moderates. Both are likely to demand greater authority in Parliament. In fact, both have been eyed as possible candidates for prime minister, if there were to be another coalition led by neither the B.J.P. nor the Congress. When the first nationwide electoral maps showing the number of seats gained and lost in Parliament were revealed on Tuesday, they showed a striking new pattern. The maps showed that Mr. Modi’s party lost swaths of territory across states in the Hindi-speaking north that were considered B.J.P. strongholds. At the same time, the B.J.P. made inroads in regions that had resisted Mr. Modi in the past. He lost dozens of seats in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, but he gained plenty in the eastern state of Odisha and the southern state of Telangana. The only part of the country that now looks unified by one party is the “tribal belt,” which weaves across the central states. Its relatively poor communities have been skillfully targeted by the B.J.P.’s Hindu-first politics and welfare benefits. Investors in India’s stock markets in Mumbai responded eagerly to the early exit polls. On Monday, they went on a buying spree, driving up the prices of so-called Modi stocks, those associated with the prime minister’s spending priorities or thought to benefit from his fiscal policies. When the actual vote results were counted, those stocks came crashing down. Shares in the Adani Group’s flagship stock lost about 19 percent of their value in one day of trading. The blue-chip index lost about 6 percent, nearly wiping out its gains from the first five months of the year. Mr. Modi remains popular with India’s business tycoons, but investors need to find out which companies will stand to benefit from a new government. Chris Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, an investment bank, warned last year that if Mr. Modi were to lose he “would expect a 25 percent correction, if not more” in the Indian stock market. Historically, Indian companies have done just as well during periods of coalition government. So, Mr. Wood said, even without Mr. Modi in power, he expects stocks to “bounce back sharply” based on the strength of the country’s economy as a whole. This new era in Parliament is sure to begin with a few rounds of political retribution. Politicians who failed to deliver seats for their bosses will be shown the door. Smaller parties are likely to demand cabinet positions, which will mean replacing members of the B.J.P. Policies will need to be revised. Will India lean into export manufacturing, aiming to replace China as the world’s factory? Will it move to protect local industries that fear foreign competition? Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, cautioned that India cannot exactly return to the coalition politics that preceded Mr. Modi. His new partners are likely to make demands that match the authoritarian style Mr. Modi exercises from New Delhi. The kind of state leaders he now needs as coalition partners “are just as absolutist as the national government,” Mr. Vaishnav said. They could, for instance, call for federal police agencies to arrest opponents, as Mr. Modi has done.

This time, there were no complaints about the electronic voting machines, or fears that India had become a dictatorship under Mr. Modi.

nytimes,"Needing Help to Stay in Power, Modi Loses His Aura of Invincibility","June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/modi-india-election.html,"Suddenly, the aura of invincibility around Narendra Modi has been shattered. In an Indian election in which his party’s slogan had promised a landslide victory and Mr. Modi even repeatedly referred to himself as sent by God, the results announced on Tuesday were unexpectedly sobering. Mr. Modi, 73, is set to take up a third consecutive term as prime minister, after the Election Commission gave final confirmation early Wednesday that the parties that make up his coalition had collectively passed the majority mark in Parliament. It is a feat that only one other Indian leader has accomplished, and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., won far more seats than any other party. But instead of a runaway win, the B.J.P. lost dozens of seats. It now finds itself at the mercy of its coalition partners — including one politician notorious for how often he has switched sides — to stay in power, a sharp reversal a decade into Mr. Modi’s transformational tenure. As the results came into view, the country’s stock markets plunged. Opposition parties, newly unified in what they had called an effort to save the country’s democracy, rejoiced. And India, while extending Mr. Modi’s firm hold on power, learned that there are limits to his political potency, even as he made the election, usually fought seat by seat, squarely about himself. Mr. Modi took a more positive view in a statement on X declaring that his coalition had won a third term. “This is a historical feat in India’s history,” he said. For Mr. Modi, a generous reading of the outcome could be that only with his personal push could his party overcome its unpopularity at the local level and scrape by. Or it could be that his carefully cultivated brand has now peaked, and that he can no longer outrun the anti-incumbency sentiment that eventually catches up with almost any politician. How Mr. Modi will react is uncertain — whether he will harden his effort to turn away any challenge to his power, or be chastened by the voters’ verdict and his need to work with coalition partners that do not share his Hindu-nationalist ideology. “Modi is not known as a consensual figure. However, he is very pragmatic,” said Arati Jerath, a political analyst based in New Delhi. “He will have to moderate his hard-line Hindu-nationalist approach to issues. Perhaps we can hope for more moderation from him.” Few doubt, however, that Mr. Modi will try to deepen his already considerable imprint on the country over the next five years. On his watch, India, the world’s most populous nation, has enjoyed newfound prominence on the global stage, overhauled its infrastructure for the needs of its 1.4 billion people, and been imbued with a new sense of ambition as it tries to shed the legacy of its long colonial past. At the same time, Mr. Modi has worked to turn a vastly diverse country held together by a secular democratic system into an overtly Hindu-first state, marginalizing the country’s large Muslim minority. His increasingly authoritarian turn — with a crackdown on dissent that has created a chilling environment of self-censorship — has pushed India’s vociferous democracy closer to a one-party state, his critics say. And the country’s economic growth, while rapid, has mostly enriched those at the top. Mr. Modi rose from a humble background as the son of a tea seller, becoming India’s most powerful and popular leader in decades by building a cult of personality, spending big on infrastructure and welfare, and tilting India’s democratic institutions in his favor. The ultimate goal was to cement his standing as one of the most consequential prime ministers in India’s nearly 75 years as a republic and make the B.J.P. the country’s only plausible national governing force. But the results on Tuesday pointed to a sharp turnaround for India’s beleaguered main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, which had been seen by many as irrevocably weakened after big losses in the previous two elections. The once-dominant Congress, long positioned at India’s political center, struggled for years to find a direction and offer an ideological alternative to the B.J.P. But it and its coalition partners found traction in this election by attacking Mr. Modi’s government over issues like unemployment, social justice and the prime minister’s ties to India’s billionaires. Last year, as Rahul Gandhi, the public face of the Congress party, sought to burnish his standing by leading long marches across India, the B.J.P. ensnared him in a court case that led to his expulsion from Parliament. He was later returned to his seat by India’s highest court, and was set to win re-election on Tuesday. Speaking as early returns came in, Mr. Gandhi, 53, said the fight was not just against the B.J.P. It was also, he said, against all the government institutions that had stood with Mr. Modi in trying to hamstring the opposition through arrests and other punitive actions. “This was about saving the Constitution,” he said, lifting a small copy that he had been carrying with him and displaying during speeches on the campaign trail. Exit polls released on Saturday, after more than six weeks of voting in the world’s largest democratic exercise, indicated that Mr. Modi’s party was headed toward an easy victory. But there had been signs during the campaign that Mr. Modi was worried about the outcome. He crisscrossed the country for more than 200 rallies over about two months and gave dozens of interviews, hoping to use his charismatic appeal to paper over any weaknesses in his party. In speeches, he often veered from his party’s message of a rising India to counter accusations that he privileged business and caste elites. He also abandoned his once-subtle dog whistles targeting India’s 200 million Muslims, instead demonizing them directly, by name. As things stood by nightfall, Mr. Modi would need at least 33 seats from allies to cross the 272 minimum for forming a government. Two regional parties in particular would be kingmakers: the Telugu Desam Party, in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, with 16 seats, and the Janata Dal (United) party in the eastern state of Bihar, with 12. Both parties are avowedly secular, raising hopes among Mr. Modi’s opponents that their influence could slow down his race to turn India’s democracy into a Hindu-first state. Some of Mr. Modi’s biggest losses came in India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh in the north, with about 240 million people. His party leads the state government and had won 62 of the state’s 80 seats in the national Parliament’s lower house in the previous election, in 2019. As counting entered its last stretch in the evening on Tuesday, the B.J.P. was leading in only 33 seats there. In his own constituency, Varanasi, Mr. Modi’s victory margin was reduced from half a million last time to about 150,000. The loss in Faizabad constituency, in particular, told the story of how some of the prime minister’s biggest offerings had struggled to connect with voters. The constituency is home to the lavish Ram temple in Ayodhya, built on grounds disputed between Hindus and Muslims. Its construction was a cornerstone of the nearly century-old Hindu-nationalist movement that had swept Mr. Modi to power. He hoped that its grand inauguration just before the election campaign began would both unite his Hindu support base and bring new supporters into the fold. Some B.J.P. workers said that the party’s flaunting of the temple may have made a large section of Hindus at the bottom of the rigid caste hierarchy uncomfortable. The opposition had painted Mr. Modi as pursuing an upper-caste agenda that denied underprivileged Hindus opportunities to reverse centuries of oppression. “Because of overemphasis on the Ram temple issue, the opposition got united,” said Subhash Punia, 62, a farmer from the state of Rajasthan who supports Mr. Modi and was waiting outside the B.J.P. headquarters in Delhi on Tuesday. To offset potential losses in his Hindi-speaking northern stronghold, Mr. Modi had set a lofty goal for this election: to gain a foothold in the country’s more prosperous south. He broke some new ground in Kerala, a state dominated by the political left and long hostile to his ideology. But overall in the south, he struggled to improve on the 29 seats, out of 129, that his party had won in the previous election. Perhaps the biggest disappointment for the B.J.P. in southern India was that it once again appeared not to have won any of the 40 seats in Tamil Nadu, a state with its own strong cultural and linguistic identity. Mr. Modi had campaigned aggressively there, even visiting one coastal town for two days of meditation as the voting neared its conclusion. “Mr. Modi’s and the B.J.P.’s antics cannot win my Tamil heart,” said S. Ganesan, a waiter at a hotel in Kanniyakumari, the town Mr. Modi visited.",suddenly aura invincibility around narendra modi shattered indian election party slogan promised landslide victory mr modi

nytimes,Modi Will Feel the Heat in a Third Term. And Not Just Politically.,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/climate/modi-climate-india-election.html,"India, the world’s most populous country, is also among the most vulnerable to climate hazards. That’s not only because of the heat and floods that global warming has exacerbated, but also because so many of the country’s 1.4 billion people are vulnerable to begin with. Most people are poor, by global standards, and they have no safety net. Narendra Modi, the Hindu nationalist prime minister who claimed victory Tuesday for a third five-year term, will face major challenges fueled by climate change. The six-week process of voting took place amid a scorching heat wave in several parts of the country. In the northern states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, at least 33 people, including poll workers, died of complications from the heat last week, according to government authorities cited by Reuters. Rohit Magotra, deputy director of Integrated Research and Action for Development, called on national election officials to reschedule elections in the future to avoid such calamities. He pointed out that workers from every political party suffer in the heat, and so do voters, who often have to line up under the sun. “I definitely see the momentum building up, and elections are unlikely to be scheduled in peak summer in future,” said Mr. Magotra, whose organization has advocated heat solutions in Indian cities. The Election Commission this year did set up a task force to monitor weather conditions, but only after voting got underway amid abnormally high temperatures. It also sent election workers a list of heat precautions prepared by the National Disaster Management Agency. However, according to a report published in Scroll, an Indian news site, political-party campaigners were not told to do anything differently because of the heat.",india world populous country also among vulnerable climate hazard thats heat flood global warming exacerbated also many country billion people vulnerable begin people poor global standard safety net narendra modi hindu nationalist prime minister claimed victory tuesday third fiveyear term face major challenge fueled climate change sixweek process voting took place amid scorching heat wave several part country northern state bihar uttar pradesh least people including poll worker died complication heat last week according government authority cited reuters rohit magotra deputy director integrated research action development called national election official reschedule election future avoid calamity pointed worker every political party suffer heat voter often line sun definitely see momentum building election unlikely scheduled peak summer future said mr magotra whose organization advocated heat solution indian city election commission year set task force monitor weather condition voting got underway amid abnormally high temperature also sent election worker list heat precaution prepared national disaster management agency however according report published scroll indian news site politicalparty campaigner told anything differently heat
nytimes,India’s Stock Market Tumbles on Close-Run Election Result,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-stock-market-election.html,"Traders in Mumbai started the day with a shock as India began tallying votes from a seven-week election and it became clear that the government of Narendra Modi was not doing nearly as well as expected. By the end of trading on Tuesday, the markets were down 6 percent, nearly wiping out the year’s gains. India’s stock market had been on a tear, buoyed by economic growth and confidence that Mr. Modi, the most powerful prime minister in generations, was sure to secure a third term in office. Investors looking to India yearn for political stability and many have done especially well during the first 10 years of Mr. Modi’s pro-business leadership. Even after Tuesday’s decline, the blue-chip Nifty 50 index has nearly tripled since Mr. Modi became prime minister. But the Indian market’s main indexes have entered choppier waters on the way to the election. Some companies, namely those considered “Modi stocks,” fared especially poorly as the election result came into view. The Adani Group’s fortunes were always the most eye-catching. Gautam Adani rapidly became Asia’s richest man, as his infrastructure-oriented businesses worked in harmony with Mr. Modi’s plans for the country. That is, until a short-seller’s report in early 2023 accused the Adani Group of market manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani’s stocks crashed, but within a year, as it became clear that the Indian government and many of the world’s biggest banks would be patient with the companies, they climbed back up. On Tuesday, Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship company, shed 19 percent of its value, putting it halfway between its peak and subsequent trough. Mr. Modi has anyway won enough seats to form a new government, albeit with a much slimmer majority than forecast. Chris Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, an investment bank, last year gamed out an even worse result for Mr. Modi, saying during an investor summit in October that if Mr. Modi were suddenly defeated, “I would expect a 25 percent correction if not more.” Some degree of correction might be welcomed, at least among professional investors. A lot of the market’s recent growth has reflected the influx of small-time local investors buying stocks for the first time. With global investors clamoring for access to India’s long-term prospects, it had become nearly impossible to find bargains. Christine Phillpotts, portfolio manager for emerging markets at Ariel Investments in Chicago, said India had become “the market that everybody loves to love.” That meant there weren’t many opportunities left, even though she agreed that India’s economy would keep growing robustly. The other consolation is that, as much as investors need to know which government policies will favor which companies, India’s track record suggests that its economy is capable of growing rapidly under conditions of vigorous, multiparty democracy. Some of the fastest rates it ever clocked were achieved under a previous coalition government, during a growth spurt from 2006 to 2010. Even Mr. Wood, who anticipated a market decline in response to Mr. Modi’s losing ground, thought that stocks “would bounce back sharply, due to the momentum” of India’s economy as a whole.",trader mumbai started day shock india began tallying vote sevenweek election became clear government narendra modi nearly well expected end trading tuesday market percent nearly wiping year gain india stock market tear buoyed economic growth confidence mr modi powerful prime minister generation sure secure third term office investor looking india yearn political stability many done especially well first year mr modis probusiness leadership even tuesday decline bluechip nifty index nearly tripled since mr modi became prime minister indian market main index entered choppier water way election company namely considered modi stock fared especially poorly election result came view adani group fortune always eyecatching gautam adani rapidly became asia richest man infrastructureoriented business worked harmony mr modis plan country shortsellers report early accused adani group market manipulation accounting fraud adanis stock crashed within year became clear indian government many world biggest bank would patient company climbed back tuesday adani enterprise group flagship company shed percent value putting halfway peak subsequent trough mr modi anyway enough seat form new government albeit much slimmer majority forecast chris wood global head equity strategy jefferies investment bank last year gamed even worse result mr modi saying investor summit october mr modi suddenly defeated would expect percent correction degree correction might welcomed least among professional investor lot market recent growth reflected influx smalltime local investor buying stock first time global investor clamoring access india longterm prospect become nearly impossible find bargain christine phillpotts portfolio manager emerging market ariel investment chicago said india become market everybody love love meant werent many opportunity left even though agreed india economy would keep growing robustly consolation much investor need know government policy favor company india track record suggests economy capable growing rapidly condition vigorous multiparty democracy fastest rate ever clocked achieved previous coalition government growth spurt even mr wood anticipated market decline response mr modis losing ground thought stock would bounce back sharply due momentum india economy whole
nytimes,Early Election Results Suggest Sharp Turnaround for Indian National Congress,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/indian-national-congress-rahul-gandhi-election.html,"In India’s last general election, in 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party won 303 of 543 parliamentary seats — nearly six times as many as the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress. It was a stinging electoral blow for the Congress, a once-dominant party that has appeared greatly diminished in recent years, and exit polls in this year’s election had not suggested it would fare much better. But early election results on Tuesday indicated a far stronger showing than expected for the Congress. The party and its allies were leading in nearly 230 races, a sharp turnaround that prompted jubilation at the Congress headquarters in New Delhi, where supporters erupted in cheers each time a television channel announced a new lead for one of its candidates. “Whatever the final results, one thing is clear — it is a moral victory for Congress and our leader Rahul Gandhi, and defeat for B.J.P.,” said Robin Michael, a political worker, referring to Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. While there was no indication that Congress and the opposition coalition it leads would scrape together a majority to unseat Mr. Modi, party workers said that they had dented Mr. Modi’s aura of invincibility. They praised Mr. Gandhi, the Congress party’s most prominent figure and a great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first post-independence prime minister. Last year, as Mr. Gandhi sought to burnish his standing by leading long marches across India, the B.J.P. ensnared him in a court case that led to his expulsion from Parliament. He was later returned to his seat by India’s highest court. On Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi was on track to win his parliamentary seat in the southern state of Kerala. The Congress, long positioned at India’s political center, has struggled to find a direction and offer an ideological alternative to the Hindu nationalist B.J.P. It has faced rebellions, infighting and periodic fits of soul-searching over whether to rally behind a new face — only to stick with its dynastic leadership. This year, despite expectations, Mr. Gandhi had set a target of doubling the party’s 2019 tally of 52 seats. By late Tuesday afternoon, it was leading in nearly 100 seats. “We will stop Modi from making a mockery of this country and turning people against each other,” said Sandeep Mishra, a Congress worker at party headquarters.

nytimes,Modi’s Party May Need Partners to Form a Government,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/modi-bjp-india-government-coalition.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party will likely need help from junior partners to form a government under the rules of India’s parliamentary system, early election results indicated on Tuesday. In a 2019 election that handed Mr. Modi a second consecutive term, his Bharatiya Janata Party won 303 of the 543 seats in Parliament. That was well over the 272 seats it needed to rule on its own. This time, exit polls released over the weekend suggested that the B.J.P. would once again easily win more than 272 seats. But as of early Tuesday afternoon, official voting results indicated that it would win about 240 seats instead. Winning that much support — 44 percent of the seats in Parliament’s lower house — is an impressive feat in India or any other country. And the new math should not prevent Mr. Modi from securing a third consecutive term as prime minister. But the dip in the B.J.P.’s electoral support, far short of Mr. Modi’s goal and his last electoral performance, will likely have political ramifications. At a minimum, the B.J.P. will have to depend more on the junior members of its existing multiparty alliance. Two of the most prominent parties do not share Mr. Modi’s Hindu-first agenda. And if the governing alliance does not win a majority, the B.J.P. will be able to form a government only by adding new partners. It may not come to that. As of Tuesday afternoon the alliance was on track to scrape by with a narrow parliamentary majority — far short of its target of 400 seats, but enough to stay in power with its existing members.",prime minister narendra modis ruling party likely need help junior partner form government rule india parliamentary system early election result indicated tuesday election handed mr modi second consecutive term bharatiya janata party seat parliament well seat needed rule time exit poll released weekend suggested bjp would easily win seat early tuesday afternoon official voting result indicated would win seat instead winning much support percent seat parliament lower house impressive feat india country new math prevent mr modi securing third consecutive term prime minister dip bjps electoral support far short mr modis goal last electoral performance likely political ramification minimum bjp depend junior member existing multiparty alliance two prominent party share mr modis hindufirst agenda governing alliance win majority bjp able form government adding new partner may come tuesday afternoon alliance track scrape narrow parliamentary majority far short target seat enough stay power existing member
nytimes,How Modi Capitalized on India’s Economic Rise,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-election-economy.html,"Ten years after Narendra Modi was first elected prime minister, India’s economy is roughly twice as large. That is what happens when a country grows at 7 percent a year, as India has been doing, on average, since it opened its markets to international competition in 1991. That steady growth has been skillfully repackaged to promote an image of one man’s leadership making it all happen. Along with nationalism and Hindu pride, the idea that Mr. Modi can make the economy move has been central to his appeal since the beginning. And Mr. Modi has burnished India’s economy in ways that count the most with voters: He made visible infrastructure expansions and distributed welfare benefits to the majority of Indians, who remain poor by global standards even as the country’s higher-income groups learn to flex their spending power. Most of the rest of the world — especially the United States and other Western countries that hope to persuade India to join them in constraining China’s and Russia’s strategic ambitions — wants India’s economy to accelerate. Part of that story could be a shift in manufacturing, like the one Apple has underway in South India. And the world’s investment professionals are eager for India’s successes under Mr. Modi to start paying dividends that they can’t find elsewhere. But even the most eager investors can’t overlook some of the problems that confront India as it becomes the world’s newest heavyweight. While Mr. Modi basked in the glow of a successful moon landing and the country’s innovative “digital public infrastructure,” the political opposition tried to speak past him to the frustrated masses who clamor for more and better jobs. The opposition also tried rousing public anger over Mr. Modi’s ties with the country’s biggest tycoons. That seems not to have worked, neither in politics nor in the markets, in the case of Gautam Adani. Last year the billionaire’s empire was accused, with much flash and fury, of stock manipulation.

nytimes,The Heat Wave Scenario That Keeps Climate Scientists Up at Night,"June 3, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/opinion/heat-technology-climate.html,"On a recent Thursday evening, a freakish windstorm called a derecho (Spanish for “straight ahead”) hit Houston, a city of more than two million people that also happens to be the epicenter of the fossil fuel industry in America. In a matter of minutes, winds of up to 100 miles per hour blew out office building windows, uprooted trees and toppled electric poles and transmission towers. Nearly a million households lost power. Which meant that not only was there no light; there was no air-conditioning. The damage from the storm was so extensive that, five days later, more than 100,000 homes and businesses were still marooned in the heat and darkness. Luckily, the day the derecho blew in, the temperature in Houston, a city infamous for its swampy summers, was in the low to mid-80s. Hot, to be sure, but for most healthy people, not life-threatening. Of the at least eight deaths reported as a result of the storm, none were from heat exposure. But if this storm had arrived several days later, perhaps over the Memorial Day weekend, when the temperature in Houston hit 96 degrees, with a heat index as high as 115, it might have been a very different story. “The Hurricane Katrina of extreme heat” is how Mikhail Chester, director of the Metis Center for Infrastructure and Sustainable Engineering at Arizona State University, once put it to me, echoing the memory of the catastrophic 2005 hurricane that struck Louisiana, devastated New Orleans and killed more than 1,300 people. Most people who died in Louisiana during Katrina died from drownings, injuries or heart conditions. But Dr. Chester was using Katrina as a metaphor for what can happen to a city unprepared for an extreme climate catastrophe. In New Orleans, the levee system was overwhelmed by torrential rains; eventually, 80 percent of the city was underwater. What if, instead, the electricity goes out for several days during a blistering summer heat wave in a city that depends on air-conditioning? In Dr. Chester’s scenario, a compounding crisis of extreme heat and a power failure in a major city like Houston could lead to cascading failures, exposing vulnerabilities in the region’s infrastructure that are difficult to foresee and could result in thousands, or even tens of thousands, of deaths from heat exposure in a matter of days. The risk to people in cities would be higher because all the concrete and asphalt amplifies the heat, pushing temperatures in the midafternoon as much as 15 degrees to 20 degrees higher than in surrounding vegetated areas. The derecho that hit Houston was a warning of just how quickly risks are multiplying in our rapidly warming world. As if to prove this point, some 10 days after the Houston blackout, another windstorm knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses in and around Dallas. One of the most dangerous illusions of the climate crisis is that the technology of modern life makes us invincible. Humans are smart. We have tools. Yeah, it will cost money. But we can adapt to whatever comes our way. As for the coral reefs that bleach in the hot oceans and the howler monkeys that fell dead out of trees during a recent heat wave in Mexico, well, that’s sad, but life goes on. This is, of course, an extremely privileged point of view. For one thing, more than 750 million people on the planet don’t have access to electricity, much less air-conditioning. (In India, New Delhi experienced temperatures as high as 120 degrees last week, leading to an increase in heatstroke, fears of blackouts and the possibility of water rationing.) But it is also a naïve point of view, if only because our bubble of invincibility is far more fragile than we know. So what can we expect in a heat Katrina? Last year, researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology, Arizona State University and the University of Michigan published a study looking at the consequences of a major blackout during an extreme heat wave in three cities: Phoenix, Detroit and Atlanta. In the study, the cause of the blackout was unspecified. “It doesn’t really matter if the blackout is the result of a cyberattack or a hurricane,” Brian Stone, the director of the Urban Climate Lab at Georgia Tech and the lead author on the study, told me. “For the purposes of our research, the effect is the same.” Whatever the cause, the study noted that the number of major blackouts in the United States more than doubled from 2015-16 to 2020-21. Dr. Stone and his colleagues focused on those three American cities because they have different demographics, climates and dependence on air-conditioning. In Detroit, 53 percent of buildings have central air-conditioning; in Atlanta, 94 percent; in Phoenix, 99 percent. The researchers modeled the health consequences for residents in a two-day, citywide blackout during a heat wave, with electricity gradually restored over the next three days. The results were shocking: In Phoenix, about 800,000 people — roughly half the population — would need emergency medical treatment for heatstroke and other illnesses. The flood of people seeking care would overwhelm the city’s hospitals. More than 13,000 people would die. Under the same scenario in Atlanta, researchers found there would be 12,540 visits to emergency rooms. Six people would die. In Detroit, which has a higher percentage of older residents and a higher poverty rate than those other cities, 221 people would die. Perhaps we should not be surprised by these numbers. Researchers estimate that in Europe there were 61,672 heat-related deaths in the summer of 2022, the hottest season on record on the continent at the time. In June 2021, a heat wave led to in nearly 900 excess deaths in the Pacific Northwest. And in 2010, an estimated 56,000 Russians died during a record summer heat wave. The hotter it gets, the more difficult it is for our bodies to cope, raising the risk of heatstroke and other heat illnesses. And it is getting hotter across the planet. Last year was the warmest year on record, and the 10 hottest years have all occurred in the last decade. In the study simulating a heat wave in those three cities, researchers found that the much larger death toll in Phoenix was explained by two factors. First, the temperatures modeled during a heat wave in Phoenix (90 to 113 degrees) were much higher than the temperatures in Atlanta (77 to 97 degrees) or Detroit (72 to 95 degrees), which have historically had milder heat waves. And second, the greater availability of air-conditioning in Phoenix means the risks from a power failure during a heat wave are much higher. A lot can be done to reduce these risks. Building cities with less concrete and asphalt and more parks and trees and access to rivers and lakes would help. So would a more sophisticated nationally standardized heat wave warning system. Major cities also need to identify the most vulnerable residents and develop targeted emergency response plans and long-term heat management plans. Making the grid itself more resilient is equally important. Better digital firewalls at grid operation centers thwart hacker intrusions. Burying transmission lines protects them from storms. Batteries to store electricity for emergencies are increasingly inexpensive. But the hotter it gets, the more vulnerable the grid becomes, even as demand for electricity spikes because customers are running their air-conditioning full throttle. Transmission lines sag, transformers explode, power plants fail. One 2016 study found the potential for cascading grid failures across Arizona to increase thirtyfold in response to a 1.8 degree rise in summer temperatures. “Most of the problems with the grid on hot days come from breakdowns at power plants or on the grid caused by the heat itself, or from the difficulty of meeting high demand for cooling,” Doug Lewin, a grid expert and author of the Texas Energy and Power newsletter, told me. The best way to fix that, Mr. Lewin argued, is to encourage people to reduce power demand in their homes with high efficiency heat pumps, better insulation and smart thermostats, and to generate their own power with solar panels and battery storage. The looming threat of a heat Katrina is a reminder of how technological progress creates new risks even as it solves old ones. On a brutally hot day during a recent trip to Jaipur, India, I visited an 18th-century building that had an indoor fountain, thick walls and a ventilation system to channel the wind through each room. There was no air-conditioning, but the building was as cool and comfortable as a new office tower in Houston. Air-conditioning may indeed be a modern necessity that many of us who live in hot parts of the world can’t survive without. But it is also a technology of forgetting. Once upon a time, people understood the dangers of extreme heat and designed ways to live with it. And now, as temperatures rise as a result of our hellbent consumption of fossil fuels, tens of thousands of lives may depend on remembering how that was done. Or finding better ways to do it.",recent thursday evening freakish windstorm called derecho spanish straight ahead hit houston city two million people also happens epicenter fossil fuel industry

nytimes,"As Voting Ends in India, Modi Awaits a Verdict on His 10 Years in Power","June 1, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/world/asia/india-election-modi.html,"Voting in India’s general election, a six-week-long referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decade in power, came to a close on Saturday as much of the country’s populous north was gripped by a deadly heat wave. Results will be tallied and announced on Tuesday. Mr. Modi, his power deeply entrenched, is seen as likely to win a third consecutive term as prime minister, which would make him only the second leader in India’s nearly 75 years as a republic to achieve that feat. Exit polls released after the last round of voting suggested a comfortable return for his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. A newly united opposition has put up a fight, rallying against Mr. Modi’s divisive politics and management of India’s deeply unequal economic growth. But the exit polls indicated it was struggling to significantly cut into the sizable majority in the 543-seat Parliament held by Mr. Modi’s party. In a message of thanks after the voting closed, Mr. Modi expressed confidence that “the people of India have voted in record numbers to re-elect” his government. But Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the largest opposition party, the Indian National Congress, played down the exit polls as “government surveys” and said the official results will show that his alliance was ahead. The election, held in phases over a month and a half, is the largest democratic exercise in the world, with more than 950 million eligible voters. The last stretch of the campaigning drew large rallies even as northern India baked under an intense heat wave, with temperatures frequently exceeding 110 degrees Fahrenheit, or more than 43 degrees Celsius. At least 19 poll workers have died from heat strokes or other health complications resulting from the heat in recent days. Elections in a parliamentary system like India’s are usually fought seat by seat, with a candidate’s fate determined by local economic and social factors. But the B.J.P. made its parliamentary campaign into a presidential-style referendum, putting the focus almost entirely on Mr. Modi and his leadership. The party hoped that Mr. Modi’s deep popularity would help it overcome a growing anti-incumbent sentiment 10 years into the B.J.P.’s rule. Mr. Modi held about 200 rallies across the country over more than two months of campaigning, hoping to lift up struggling candidates in his party. He also went on a media blitz, giving about 80 interviews to television stations and newspapers, almost all of them friendly to him. As the campaigning ended and a mandatory two-day election pause was set to begin, Mr. Modi retreated south to the memorial of one of India’s most celebrated monks for two days of meditation. The country’s media followed. The stream of videos and photos put out by his office, shot from multiple angles in a place where photography is usually not allowed, led the nightly news and television debates. Mr. Modi’s opponents cried foul, saying that the exercise amounted to prohibited campaigning — and that it exemplified the uneven playing field he has created. “The weather is good. The prime minister is sitting in meditation there and he has mellowed the sun goddess,” Ravi Kishan, an actor and B.J.P. candidate, told local media outlets. “This is historic — amidst intense heat, the wind started blowing today.” The opposition, hamstrung by arrests and other punitive actions as part of a crackdown, still mustered its most united front in years. Opposition leaders painted Mr. Modi as a friend to billionaires who has struggled to create jobs for the country’s large youth population. They called his party elitist, accusing it of not lifting up those in the middle and lower ends of India’s caste system. The opposition has stoked fears that if the B.J.P. remained in power, it might change the country’s Constitution to do away with affirmative action for middle and lower castes, a system put in place many decades ago to address centuries of oppression in India’s rigidly hierarchical society. Mr. Modi has vehemently rejected the charges as unfounded; the party under him has increased its outreach to lower castes. To try to keep his Hindu support base united, he turned to anti-Muslim rhetoric, leveling attacks that were unusually direct for him in recent years. The opposition has also tried to win over voters by promising a long list of welfare offerings, including the waiving of farmers’ loans, cash transfers for women and paid apprenticeships for the young. Mr. Modi, on the other hand, has stuck to an image of fiscal prudence, only highlighting his existing offerings. That, his party members say, was because he was confident of winning a third term, and he did not want to over-promise. But even though the opposition seemed to gain some traction, it faces an uphill task in unseating Mr. Modi’s government. He has built a huge electoral advantage with a robust and well-funded political machinery. In the last election, Mr. Modi’s party won 303 seats, nearly six times as many as its closest national competitor, the Indian National Congress party.",voting india general election sixweeklong referendum prime minister narendra modis decade power came close saturday much country populous north gripped deadly heat wave result tallied announced tuesday mr modi power deeply entrenched seen likely win third consecutive term prime minister would make second leader india nearly year republic achieve feat exit poll released last round voting suggested comfortable return hindunationalist bharatiya janata party bjp newly united opposition put fight rallying mr modis divisive politics management india deeply unequal economic growth exit poll indicated struggling significantly cut sizable majority seat parliament held mr modis party message thanks voting closed mr modi expressed confidence people india voted record number reelect government mallikarjun kharge president largest opposition party indian national congress played exit poll government survey said official result show alliance ahead election held phase month half largest democratic exercise world million eligible voter last stretch campaigning drew large rally even northern india baked intense heat wave temperature frequently exceeding degree fahrenheit degree celsius least poll worker died heat stroke health complication resulting heat recent day election parliamentary system like india usually fought seat seat candidate fate determined local economic social factor bjp made parliamentary campaign presidentialstyle referendum putting focus almost entirely mr modi leadership party hoped mr modis deep popularity would help overcome growing antiincumbent sentiment year bjps rule mr modi held rally across country two month campaigning hoping lift struggling candidate party also went medium blitz giving interview television station newspaper almost friendly campaigning ended mandatory twoday election pause set begin mr modi retreated south memorial one india celebrated monk two day meditation country medium followed stream video photo put office shot multiple angle place photography usually allowed led nightly news television debate mr modis opponent cried foul saying exercise amounted prohibited campaigning exemplified uneven playing field created weather good prime minister sitting meditation mellowed sun goddess ravi kishan actor bjp candidate told local medium outlet historic amidst intense heat wind started blowing today opposition hamstrung arrest punitive action part crackdown still mustered united front year opposition leader painted mr modi friend billionaire struggled create job country large youth population called party elitist accusing lifting middle lower end india caste system opposition stoked fear bjp remained power might change country constitution away affirmative action middle lower caste system put place many decade ago address century oppression india rigidly hierarchical society mr modi vehemently rejected charge unfounded party increased outreach lower caste try keep hindu support base united turned antimuslim rhetoric leveling attack unusually direct recent year opposition also tried win voter promising long list welfare offering including waiving farmer loan cash transfer woman paid apprenticeship young mr modi hand stuck image fiscal prudence highlighting existing offering party member say confident winning third term want overpromise even though opposition seemed gain traction face uphill task unseating mr modis government built huge electoral advantage robust wellfunded political machinery last election mr modis party seat nearly six time many closest national competitor indian national congress party
nytimes,A Small Army Combating a Flood of Deepfakes in India’s Election,"June 1, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/world/asia/india-election-deepfakes.html,"Through the middle of a high-stakes election being held during a mind-melting heat wave, a blizzard of confusing deepfakes blows across India. The variety seems endless: A.I.-powered mimicry, ventriloquy and deceptive editing effects. Some of it is crude, some jokey, some so obviously fake that it could never be expected to be seen as real. The overall effect is confounding, adding to a social media landscape already inundated with misinformation. The volume of online detritus is far too great for any election commission to track, let alone debunk. A diverse bunch of vigilante fact-checking outfits have sprung up to fill the breach. While the wheels of law grind slowly and unevenly, the job of tracking down deepfakes has been taken up by hundreds of government workers and private fact-checking groups based in India. “We have to be ready,” said Surya Sen, a forestry officer in the state of Karnataka who has been reassigned during the election to manage a team of 70 people hunting down deceptive A.I.-generated content. “Social media is a battleground this year.” When Mr. Sen’s team finds content they believe is illegal, they tell social media platforms to take it down, publicize the deception or even ask for criminal charges to filed. Celebrities have become familiar fodder for politically pointed tricks, including Ranveer Singh, a star in Hindi cinema. During a videotaped interview with an Indian news agency at the Ganges River in Varanasi, Mr. Singh praised the powerful prime minister, Narendra Modi, for celebrating “our rich cultural heritage.” But that is not what viewers heard when an altered version of the video, with a voice that sounded like Mr. Singh’s and a nearly perfect lip sync, made the rounds on social media. “We call these lip-sync deepfakes,” said Pamposh Raina, who leads the Deepfakes Analysis Unit, a collective of Indian media houses that opened a tip line on WhatsApp where people can send suspicious videos and audio to be scrutinized. She said the video of Mr. Singh was a typical example of authentic footage edited with an A.I.-cloned voice. The actor filed a complaint with the Mumbai police’s Cyber Crime Unit. In this election, no party has a monopoly on deceptive content. Another manipulated clip opened with authentic footage showing Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Modi’s most prominent opponent, partaking in the mundane ritual of swearing himself in as a candidate. Then it was layered with an A.I.-generated audio track. Mr. Gandhi did not actually resign from his party. This clip contains a personal dig, too, making Mr. Gandhi seem to say that he could “no longer pretend to be Hindu.” Mr. Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, which exit polls on Saturday showed had a comfortable lead, presents itself as a defender of the Hindu faith, and its opponents as traitors or impostors. Sometimes, political deepfakes veer into the supernatural. Dead politicians have a way of coming back to life via uncanny, A.I.-generated likenesses that endorse the real-life campaigns of their descendants. In a video that appeared a few days before voting began in April, a resurrected H. Vasanthakumar, who died of Covid-19 in 2020, spoke indirectly about his own death and blessed his son Vijay, who is running for his father’s former parliamentary seat in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. This apparition followed an example set by two other deceased titans of Tamil politics, Muthuvel Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa Jayaram. Mr. Modi’s government has been framing laws that are supposed to protect Indians from deepfakes and other kinds of misleading content. An “IT Rules” act of 2021 makes online platforms, unlike in the United States, responsible for all kinds of objectionable content, including impersonations intended to cause insult. The Internet Freedom Foundation, an Indian digital rights group, which has argued that these powers are far too broad, is tracking 17 legal challenges to the law. But the prime minister himself seems receptive to some kinds of A.I.-generated content. A pair of videos produced with A.I. tools show two of India’s biggest politicians, Mr. Modi and Mamata Banerjee, one of his staunchest opponents, emulating a viral YouTube video of the American rapper Lil Yachty doing “the HARDEST walk out EVER.” Mr. Modi shared the video on X, saying such creativity was “a delight.” Election officers like Mr. Sen in Karnataka called it political satire: “A Modi rock star is fine and not a violation. People know this is fake.” The police in West Bengal, where Ms. Banerjee is the chief minister, sent notices to some people for posting “offensive, malicious and inciting” content. On the hunt for deepfakes, Mr. Sen said his team in Karnataka, which works for a state government controlled by the opposition, vigilantly scrolls through social media platforms like Instagram and X, searching for keywords and repeatedly refreshing the accounts of popular influencers. The Deepfakes Analysis Unit has 12 fact-checking partners in the media, including a couple that are close to Mr. Modi’s national government. Ms. Raina said her unit works with external forensics labs, too, including one at the University of California, Berkeley. They use A.I.-detection software such as TrueMedia, which scans media files and determines whether they should be trusted. Some tech-savvy engineers are refining A.I.-forensic software to identify which portion of a video was manipulated, all the way down to individual pixels. Pratik Sinha, a founder of Alt News, the most venerable of India’s independent fact-checking sites, said that the possibilities of deepfakes had not yet been fully harnessed. Someday, he said, videos could show politicians not only saying things they did not say but also doing things they did not do. Dr. Hany Farid has been teaching digital forensics at Berkeley for 25 years and collaborates with the Deepfakes Analysis Unit on some cases. He said that while “we’re catching the bad deepfakes,” if more sophisticated fakes entered the arena, they might go undetected. In India as elsewhere, the arms race is on, between deepfakers and fact-checkers — fighting from all sides. Dr. Farid described this as “the first year I would say we have really started to see the impact of A.I. in interesting and more nefarious ways.”",middle highstakes election held mindmelting heat wave blizzard confusing deepfakes blow across india variety seems endless aipowered mimicry ventriloquy deceptive editing effect crude jokey obviously fake could never expected seen real overall effect confounding adding social medium landscape already inundated misinformation volume online detritus far great election commission track let alone debunk diverse bunch vigilante factchecking outfit sprung fill breach wheel law grind slowly unevenly job tracking deepfakes taken hundred government worker private factchecking group based india ready said surya sen forestry officer state karnataka reassigned election manage team people hunting deceptive aigenerated content social medium battleground year mr sen team find content believe illegal tell social medium platform take publicize deception even ask criminal charge filed celebrity become familiar fodder politically pointed trick including ranveer singh star hindi cinema videotaped interview indian news agency ganges river varanasi mr singh praised powerful prime minister narendra modi celebrating rich cultural heritage viewer heard altered version video voice sounded like mr singhs nearly perfect lip sync made round social medium call lipsync deepfakes said pamposh raina lead deepfakes analysis unit collective indian medium house opened tip line whatsapp people send suspicious video audio scrutinized said video mr singh typical example authentic footage edited aicloned voice actor filed complaint mumbai police cyber crime unit election party monopoly deceptive content another manipulated clip opened authentic footage showing rahul gandhi mr modis prominent opponent partaking mundane ritual swearing candidate layered aigenerated audio track mr gandhi actually resign party clip contains personal dig making mr gandhi seem say could longer pretend hindu mr modis governing bharatiya janata party exit poll saturday showed comfortable lead present defender hindu faith opponent traitor impostor sometimes political deepfakes veer supernatural dead politician way coming back life via uncanny aigenerated likeness endorse reallife campaign descendant video appeared day voting began april resurrected h vasanthakumar died covid spoke indirectly death blessed son vijay running father former parliamentary seat southern state tamil nadu apparition followed example set two deceased titan tamil politics muthuvel karunanidhi jayalalithaa jayaram mr modis government framing law supposed protect indian deepfakes kind misleading content rule act make online platform unlike united state responsible kind objectionable content including impersonation intended cause insult internet freedom foundation indian digital right group argued power far broad tracking legal challenge law prime minister seems receptive kind aigenerated content pair video produced ai tool show two india biggest politician mr modi mamata banerjee one staunchest opponent emulating viral youtube video american rapper lil yachty hardest walk ever mr modi shared video x saying creativity delight election officer like mr sen karnataka called political satire modi rock star fine violation people know fake police west bengal m banerjee chief minister sent notice people posting offensive malicious inciting content hunt deepfakes mr sen said team karnataka work state government controlled opposition vigilantly scroll social medium platform like instagram x searching keywords repeatedly refreshing account popular influencers deepfakes analysis unit factchecking partner medium including couple close mr modis national government m raina said unit work external forensics lab including one university california berkeley use aidetection software truemedia scan medium file determines whether trusted techsavvy engineer refining aiforensic software identify portion video manipulated way individual pixel pratik sinha founder alt news venerable india independent factchecking site said possibility deepfakes yet fully harnessed someday said video could show politician saying thing say also thing dr hany farid teaching digital forensics berkeley year collaborates deepfakes analysis unit case said catching bad deepfakes sophisticated fake entered arena might go undetected india elsewhere arm race deepfakers factcheckers fighting side dr farid described first year would say really started see impact ai interesting nefarious way
nytimes,"Birubala Rabha, Who Battled Witch Hunting in India, Dies at 75","May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/world/asia/birubala-rabha-dead.html,"Birubala Rabha, an Indian social activist who fought the practice of branding women as witches in the country’s remote northeast, died on May 13 in Guwahati, the capital of Assam State in that region. She was 75. Her death, in a hospital, was caused by cancer, her assistant, Usha Rabha, said in an interview. (They were not related.) So-called witch hunting has been a scourge throughout India, preying on mostly village women who are often single, widowed or otherwise isolated and involved in property or marital disputes. Accused of being witches, they have been tortured and in many cases murdered; from 2010 to 2021, more than 1,500 were killed in India, according to the country’s National Crime Records Bureau. Ms. Rabha, a slight, bespectacled woman who was born poor in an Assam village, faced down mobs for her work, badgered the police and pushed for legal protection for women. Her efforts were rewarded when legislation outlawing witch hunting was passed in Assam State in 2015. Cases there have dropped sharply, to a few per year from the several a month that were being reported when she began her campaign in the early 2000s, said Usha Rabha, who worked at Mission Birubala, the nongovernmental organization that Birubala Rabha founded. The victims of witch hunts face gruesome punishments, according to “Contemporary Practices of Witch Hunting,” a 2015 report by the Indian legal nonprofit Partners for Law in Development. They can be subjected to “forcible stripping,” the report said, “being paraded naked in public, cutting or tonsuring of the hair, blackening of the face, cutting off of the nose, pulling of the teeth to ‘defang’, gouging out the eye, whipping, gang rape, forcible consumption of human excreta, cow dung” or “killing by hanging, hacking, lynching or burying alive.” Ms. Rabha traveled from village to village in Assam to speak out against the practice and declared that there was no such thing as “daini,” or witches. She had long been suspicious of folk superstitions and of medicine men who chanted incantations over young women to drive out what they believed were evil spirits. As a young mother, Ms. Rabha was told by a local medicine man that her mentally ill son would soon die; he didn’t. That false prediction, in the 1980s, was the seed for her advocacy work, which she began in earnest around 2000. That year, she stood up in a meeting in the village of Lakhipur, also in Assam, to support five women accused of being witches; she didn’t back down when hundreds of villagers surrounded her house the next day. Usha Rabha recalled her first rescue mission with Ms. Rabha, in 2006, when a stick-bearing mob encircled them in a neighboring state. “I was terrified,” she said. But Birubala was “completely unfazed,” Ms. Rabha said. When the police came to rescue the two women, she said, Birubala “reprimanded the cops, saying, ‘I will not stop until I finish the work that I do.’” In Assam, in the 2000s, Birubala Rabha became allied with the state’s former police director general, Kuladhar Saikia. “She would come to me, meet me and discuss these issues,” Mr. Saikia recalled in an interview, adding, “She told me she was standing up against social injustice.” “She was a courageous lady,” he said. “When I was looking for someone to stand up against injustice, they were few. What she accomplished, this village lady, it was quite praiseworthy.” But when she began her campaign, she was quite isolated, as she recalled in a 2016 interview for a New York Times video about her work. “When I started fighting against witch hunts, villagers came in packs to beat me up and kill me,” she told the filmmaker and journalist Vikram Singh, who made the video. “The police did not help us earlier.” She added, “My own relatives called me a witch after my husband died of cancer.” Birubala Rabha was born on Feb. 5, 1949, in the village of Thakurvila, in Assam’s Goalpara district. Her father, Kaliya Rabha, a farmer, died when she was 6. Her mother, Sagarbala Rabha, was a farmworker. Birubala, who had only a grade-school education, married a farmer at 15. She is survived by three sons, Dharmeshwar, Bishnu Prasad and Dayalu, and a daughter, Kumuli Rabha. In 2021, Ms. Rabha was given the Padma Shri, a civilian award, by the Indian government.

nytimes,"Overlooked No More: Hansa Mehta, Who Fought for Women’s Equality in India and Beyond","May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/obituaries/hansa-mehta-overlooked.html,"This article is part of Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times. Human rights has long been considered a Western concept, but recent scholarship has been uncovering the influence of women from the global south. Women like Hansa Mehta. Mehta stood up against the British government during India’s struggle for independence. She campaigned for women’s social and political equality and their right to an education. And she fought for her ideals during the framing of the constitution for a newly independent India. For Mehta, women’s rights were human rights. This conviction was best exemplified at a 1947 meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, to which she had been appointed as one of just two women delegates, alongside Eleanor Roosevelt. Mehta boldly objected to the wording of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the commission was tasked with framing. It read: “All men are born free and equal in dignity and rights, they are endowed by nature with reason and conscience, and should act towards one another like brothers.” Mehta pointed out that the phrase “all men” was out of date and could be interpreted to exclude women. Roosevelt countered that the use of the word “men” was “generally accepted to include all human beings,” according to minutes of the meeting. But Mehta — a soft-spoken, slight woman who dressed in traditional saris — held her ground, insisting that the language should be changed to “human beings.” The declaration was adopted with her suggestion the next year, and it has been used as the foundation for treaties around the world. Two years earlier, Mehta was one of three women who drafted the Indian Women’s Charter of Rights and Duties, which affirmed that women have equal rights to education, suffrage, pay and distribution of property, as well as the same rights as men in marriage and divorce. When the panel that became the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in 1946 was forming its guiding principles, it turned to her ideas. In her work for the U.N., as in all her endeavors, Mehta took women’s participation in public and political realms to new heights. Hansa Mehta was born on July 3, 1897, in Surat (now in the northwestern state of Gujarat), to Harshadagauri and Manubhai Mehta. Her father, Manubhai, was a philosophy professor at Baroda College (now Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda); he later became the prime minister of the state of Baroda. Hansa’s paternal grandfather, Nandshankar Mehta, was headmaster of an English-language school, a civil servant and the author of the historical novel “Karan Ghelo”(1866), about the 13th-century ruler of Gujarat whose foolishness resulted in the loss of his kingdom. It is considered the first novel written in the Gujarati language. “I was fortunate enough to be born in a family which had liberal ideas on all questions of life,” Mehta said in 1972 in an oral history at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library in New Delhi. At a time when she estimated that only 2 percent of Indian women were literate, Mehta attended a high school for girls that had been set up by Baroda’s progressive ruler. She read widely, including novels by Sir Walter Scott and James Fenimore Cooper. She was one of a handful of young women to receive a bachelor’s degree, hers in philosophy, from Baroda College. Mehta continued her education in England, where she met the poet and political activist Sarojini Naidu. Naidu took her under her wing and brought her to the International Woman Suffrage Alliance conference in Geneva in 1920. Naidu “made me do things I otherwise would not have dreamt of doing,” like speaking in public, Mehta wrote in “Indian Woman,” a 1981 collection of her essays. In 1923, she traveled alone to the United States, a rare undertaking for women at the time, and visited colleges and universities to learn about American women’s education. She met Mohandas K. Gandhi when he was in jail in India in the 1920s, and in 1930 she responded to his call for women to join the freedom movement. She picketed stores that sold English rather than Indian-made cloth and helped lead protests, landing in jail three times. As a founder of the All India Women’s Conference, and later its president, Mehta tied the political struggle for India’s independence with the fight to improve the condition of her countrywomen. “If we wish to build up a democratic state, it will not pay the state to keep half the number of its citizens uneducated,” she wrote in “Indian Woman.” But she opposed special quotas; she wanted to level the playing field between men and women. Mehta was appointed to the Commission on the Status of Women in 1946 and to the Commission on Human Rights in 1947 — the same year that India gained its independence — and served until 1952. In 1946, she was one of about 15 women to join India’s Constituent Assembly, which met to write a constitution for the new nation. As an assembly member she lobbied for a civil code that would eventually supersede religious laws and ensure gender equality, and she strengthened the language on what are known as “directive principles” — guidelines that are unenforceable by the courts but nonetheless crucial in governing a multiethnic and multireligious secular democracy. In 1924, Mehta married Jivraj Mehta (a common surname in India), the chief medical officer in Baroda. The marriage was regarded as controversial because he was of a lower caste. She said in her oral history that her own community wanted to expel her from her caste, “but then I told them I was going out of the caste myself, as I did not believe in caste.” She and her husband had two children. He became the first chief minister of Gujarat in 1960 and, in 1963, the Indian high commissioner to the United Kingdom, a post equivalent to an ambassadorship. Mehta was vice chancellor of the Shreemati Nathibai Damodar Thackersey Women’s University (commonly known as S.N.D.T.) from 1946 to 1948 and vice chancellor of the University of Baroda from 1949 to 1958. At Baroda, she was the first woman to hold that title at an Indian coed university. The library there is named after her. In 2021, the U.N. held the inaugural Dr. Hansa Mehta Dialogue, a discussion on the fundamental importance of women’s empowerment. Throughout her life, Mehta wrote essays and translated stories and plays into Gujarati. She died at 98 on April 4, 1995. In the oral history, when she was asked why India, although it was largely conservative in its attitude toward women, had more women in the public and political sphere than many Western nations, Mehta spoke of Shakti, the female personification of divine power. “Historical reasons,” she replied, “because from the beginning we have always considered woman as a competent person. ‘Shakti’ — she is always worshiped as ‘Shakti.’” Radha Vatsal’s historical novel “No. 10 Doyers Street,” about a woman journalist from India who becomes embroiled in the case of a Chinatown gangster in 1900s New York,

nytimes,A Matter of Survival as South Asia’s Heat Wave Reaches 127 Degrees,"May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/world/asia/pakistan-india-heat-wave.html,"As South Asia bakes under a blistering heat wave, life-or-death decisions arrive with the midday sun. Abideen Khan and his 10-year-old son need every penny of the $3.50 a day they can make molding mud into bricks at a kiln under the open sky in Jacobabad, a city in southern Pakistan. But as temperatures have soared as high as 126 degrees Fahrenheit, or 52 degrees Celsius, in recent days, they have been forced to stop by 1 p.m., cutting their earnings in half. “This isn’t heat,” said Mr. Khan, sweat dripping down his face and soaking through his worn clothes. “It’s a punishment, maybe from God.” It is yet another brutal summer in the age of climate change, in a part of the world that is among the most vulnerable to its dire effects. And there is more suffering to come: The extreme heat that Pakistan and neighboring India have been experiencing will continue for days or weeks, forecasters say. Already, it has exacted a deadly toll. In the northern Indian state of Bihar, officials said that at least 14 people had died from the heat. Reports from other states in India’s north indicate that the count could be considerably higher. In both India and Pakistan, hospitals have reported large numbers of heatstroke cases. Ten of those who have died in Bihar were poll workers preparing for the voting to be held in the state on Saturday, the final day of India’s national election. To mitigate the heat, glucose and electrolytes are being distributed to polling officers, tents are being erected to provide shade and earthenware pots will provide cool water. In the state of Uttar Pradesh, at least six election security workers have died. New Delhi, where temperatures have approached 122 this week, nearly 20 degrees above normal, recorded its first official heat-related death of the year on Wednesday. In Jacobabad, long regarded as one of the hottest places on earth, the temperature reached 126 degrees on Sunday, with highs of 124 each of the following three days. About 75 miles away, the Pakistani town of Mohenjo Daro, notable for its Indus Valley civilization sites from 2500 B.C., reached 127 degrees on Sunday, just shy of a record set in 2010. The blazing temperatures compound the challenges for Pakistan, a country of 241 million people that is already grappling with economic and political turmoil. For the more than one million people who live in the Jacobabad district, life is dominated by constant efforts to find ways to cope with the heat. Blackouts lasting 12 to 20 hours a day are common, and some villages lack electricity altogether. The absence of necessities like readily available water and proper housing exacerbates the suffering. Most residents cannot afford air-conditioning or alternatives, like Chinese-made solar power batteries and chargeable fans. A solar panel to run two fans and a lightbulb costs about a month’s wages for laborers in Jacobabad. The water crisis is so severe that donkeys can be seen on the streets carrying tanks, from which residents buy enough water to fill five small plastic jerrycans for $1. Soaring demand has pushed up the price of ice, making this essential commodity even harder to find. Many of the poor have no choice but to work outside. Rice, the lifeblood of Pakistan’s agriculture, demands backbreaking labor in the fields from May to July, the hottest months. For Sahiba, a 25-year-old farmworker who uses one name, each day starts before dawn. She cooks for her family, then walks for miles with other women to reach the fields, where they toil until afternoon under the relentless sun. Nine months pregnant with her 10th child, she carries a double burden. “If we take a day or half-day break, there’s no daily wage, which means my children go hungry that night,” Ms. Sahiba said. Each summer, 25 to 30 percent of the district’s population becomes temporary climate refugees, according to community activists. Some seek refuge in Quetta, a city 185 miles north, where the heat is more bearable. Others go to the port city of Karachi, 310 miles south, which has had its own deadly heat waves but offers some relief with its less frequent blackouts. “Those who can afford it may rent houses in cooler cities, but most residents are simply too poor. They struggle to survive under makeshift tents erected in the open sky,” said Jan Odhano, head of the Community Development Foundation, a Jacobabad-based organization that helps the poor cope with the heat. Jansher Khoso, a 38-year-old garment worker, knows this struggle all too well. In 2018, his mother went to the hospital with heatstroke as temperatures spiked in Jacobabad. Now, every April, he sends his family to Quetta, where they remain until the autumn, while he works in Karachi. But this comes at a steep price. “I work for 16 hours in Karachi to afford the expense of this temporary migration,” Mr. Khoso said, “because I don’t want any of my family members to die in the cruel heat of Jacobabad.” Jacobabad’s suffering has not been limited to high temperatures. In 2022, monsoon rains and devastating floods — linked to erratic weather patterns associated with climate change — submerged the district and about a third of Pakistan overall, killing at least 1,700 people. The heat is nothing new in the city, which was named after John Jacob, a British brigadier general who experienced its harsh climate firsthand in the 19th century. Leading a small force to quell rebel tribes and bandits, General Jacob lost a lieutenant and seven soldiers to the heat on the first day of a 10-mile march. His diary described the wind as “a blast from the furnace” even at night. To cope with the hostile climate, General Jacob introduced an irrigation system and built three canals to supply fresh river water to residents. Today, the canals are dry and full of garbage.",south asia bakes blistering heat wave lifeordeath decision arrive midday sun abideen khan yearold son need every penny day make molding mud brick kiln open sky jacobabad city southern pakistan temperature soared high degree fahrenheit degree celsius recent day forced stop pm cutting earnings half isnt heat said mr khan sweat dripping face soaking worn clothes punishment maybe god yet another brutal summer age climate change part world among vulnerable dire effect suffering come extreme heat pakistan neighboring india experiencing continue day week forecaster say already exacted deadly toll northern indian state bihar official said least people died heat report state india north indicate count could considerably higher india pakistan hospital reported large number heatstroke case ten died bihar poll worker preparing voting held state saturday final day india national election mitigate heat glucose electrolyte distributed polling officer tent erected provide shade earthenware pot provide cool water state uttar pradesh least six election security worker died new delhi temperature approached week nearly degree normal recorded first official heatrelated death year wednesday jacobabad long regarded one hottest place earth temperature reached degree sunday high following three day mile away pakistani town mohenjo daro notable indus valley civilization site bc reached degree sunday shy record set blazing temperature compound challenge pakistan country million people already grappling economic political turmoil one million people live jacobabad district life dominated constant effort find way cope heat blackout lasting hour day common village lack electricity altogether absence necessity like readily available water proper housing exacerbates suffering resident afford airconditioning alternative like chinesemade solar power battery chargeable fan solar panel run two fan lightbulb cost month wage laborer jacobabad water crisis severe donkey seen street carrying tank resident buy enough water fill five small plastic jerrycans soaring demand pushed price ice making essential commodity even harder find many poor choice work outside rice lifeblood pakistan agriculture demand backbreaking labor field may july hottest month sahiba yearold farmworker us one name day start dawn cook family walk mile woman reach field toil afternoon relentless sun nine month pregnant th child carry double burden take day halfday break there daily wage mean child go hungry night m sahiba said summer percent district population becomes temporary climate refugee according community activist seek refuge quetta city mile north heat bearable others go port city karachi mile south deadly heat wave offer relief le frequent blackout afford may rent house cooler city resident simply poor struggle survive makeshift tent erected open sky said jan odhano head community development foundation jacobabadbased organization help poor cope heat jansher khoso yearold garment worker know struggle well mother went hospital heatstroke temperature spiked jacobabad every april sends family quetta remain autumn work karachi come steep price work hour karachi afford expense temporary migration mr khoso said dont want family member die cruel heat jacobabad jacobabads suffering limited high temperature monsoon rain devastating flood linked erratic weather pattern associated climate change submerged district third pakistan overall killing least people heat nothing new city named john jacob british brigadier general experienced harsh climate firsthand th century leading small force quell rebel tribe bandit general jacob lost lieutenant seven soldier heat first day mile march diary described wind blast furnace even night cope hostile climate general jacob introduced irrigation system built three canal supply fresh river water resident today canal dry full garbage
nytimes,"Wall Street Lands on India, Looking for Profits It Can’t Find in China","May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/business/india-foreign-investors.html,"Mumbai, India’s financial capital, has seen a lot of new faces over the past year. The heads of global banks have been trooping through, visiting its stock exchanges, buying property and hiring new staff. A postpandemic boom has pushed the value of India’s stock market to about $5 trillion, putting it neck and neck with Hong Kong’s. India’s economy is among the fastest growing in the world. Wall Street can’t ignore India anymore. The point of entry is Mumbai, a port city of 26 million people, counting its suburbs. Mumbai has been given a makeover: Suspension bridges span its seaways, as well as its infamous slums, and new metro lines have been carved beneath its Art Deco and Indo-Saracenic facades and rumbling commuter railways. Mumbai has been India’s commercial hub for eight decades, but it was relatively unfamiliar to global finance until the past two years. Now North American pension managers, sovereign wealth funds from the Persian Gulf and Singapore, Japanese banks and private equity firms are clamoring for a piece of India’s growth. Old hands and novices alike can rattle off reasons India’s rise is inevitable. Making money will be easier said than done, not least because Indian investors got here first. Compared with Indian companies’ current profits, their stock prices are high. Foreign investors have yet to throw in their full financial weight. Mumbai’s markets were jittery in May, as Narendra Modi, the pro-business prime minister, fought for re-election. He is expected to win, but uncertainties have made far-flung investors feel cautious. Despite all the hot money pouring into the Mumbai markets, India remains a tricky place for foreign companies to navigate, making direct investment risky. Demand for spending by India’s potentially vast base of consumers has been lagging expectations — the top of the income ladder is spending more than ever, while hundreds of millions of people are stuck near the bottom. The simple reason for investors’ enthusiasm is India’s economy, which has strengths other big emerging economies are currently lacking. Foreign clients, an Indian bank executive said, “gravitate to India because it is showing reliable growth, its currency is stable, it’s showing fiscal discipline.” He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he works closely with the government. If India looks better to global investors, China and Russia look worse. China’s miraculous growth engine is sputtering, after three decades at full throttle, with threats of trade wars becoming routine. And Russia was effectively crossed off some lists of viable emerging economies after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the sanctions imposed on it by the United States, Europe and their allies. That is one reason, the banker said, investors pushed Wall Street to make it easier to bet big sums of money on India. The MSCI, an influential stock index of emerging markets started by Morgan Stanley, has increased India’s weighting to more than 18 percent, from 8 percent in 2020, while reducing China’s representation. It’s not just stocks: In June, JPMorgan Chase will add Indian government bonds to its emerging-markets index. Both changes mean that mutual funds are buying more Indian financial assets. Aashish Agarwal, India country head for the investment bank Jefferies, has been doing deals in Mumbai for more than 20 years. He said the case for investing in India was a no-brainer: Indian stocks are outperforming China’s. India’s markets also draw on a wider range of companies than many other emerging economies, he said. “You can’t think of Korea without Samsung, or Latin America without commodities,” Mr. Agarwal said. “India, as an index, is arguably the most balanced you might find outside of the U.S.” The view looks equally sunny to Kevin Carter from Lafayette, Calif. He founded an investment firm, called EMQQ Global, that sells exchange-traded funds, which make it easy for ordinary people to invest in emerging markets. The value of one fund that focuses on India’s internet and e-commerce sectors has grown nearly 40 percent in the past year. India, he said, has the makings of what historically has helped emerging markets to succeed: a large population, especially of young people, and economic growth that is causing people to spend more. With 1.4 billion people and counting, India is the world’s most populous country. Most Indians are working age or will be soon, unlike residents of Europe or East Asia. India’s economic growth rate, which hovered around 7 percent for the past couple of years, has compared favorably with a world average of 3.2 percent. On Friday, on the eve of the election’s last day, India’s central bank delivered a happy surprise. Growth in the most recent quarter was even higher than economists expected, giving the past fiscal year an official rate of 8.2 percent. Still, for some investors, there is an air of déjà vu. They remember a time almost 15 years ago when India was last thought to be ready to overtake China’s rate of economic growth. Those who bought the India hype then ended up disappointed. From 2008 to 2020, China’s per-capita income quadrupled while India’s grew by 2.5 times. That left India poor compared with the rest of the world. The latest calculation by the International Monetary Fund placed India at 138 in national rankings of income, between the Republic of Congo and Nicaragua. China was in 65th place. But India is moving up, a lot faster than China can. Along the way, India is spending heavily on public infrastructure, a hallmark of Mr. Modi’s policies in 10 years in office. In Mumbai itself, there were just three skyscrapers in 2008 — it will have sprouted hundreds by the end of this year. The city’s center of gravity has shifted from its downtown to the purpose-built Bandra Kurla Complex, or BKC, a midtown sprawl of concrete spaghetti. The One BKC tower, home to Bank of America and Switzerland’s insurance giant Swiss Re, as well as many others, was bought by Blackstone, the world’s biggest private-equity group, for a reported $300 million in 2019. Mumbai, of course, is also home to the stock market, which has attracted the savings of India’s own rapidly expanding investor class. Banks have made it easier for middle-income Indian families to invest directly. So many newbie investors have lost money on the risky trading of derivatives — investment securities tied to other securities — that the regulators want to rein them back in. A stiffer test for India’s economy will be whether it can draw more foreign direct investment — the buying up of whole chunks of private businesses by investors or companies. Nivruti Rai, managing director of Invest India, a joint venture between the commerce ministry and private chambers of commerce, is trying to ease the way. Ms. Rai is well positioned for the job, having spent nearly 30 years at Intel, spanning India and America. “I am a woman, I come from tech, from a multinational,” she said, “and I’m based in India. All this sends a message.” More longer-term foreign funding would help strengthen and stabilize the Indian rupee. Investors who make such financial commitments also tend to bring technical expertise. “We may be missing on capital and, in some places, we may be missing on technology,” she said. Ms. Rai has a lofty target — $100 billion in foreign direct investment. That’s higher than what India drew in 2021, which was a record, and much higher than it is now. The inflow sank 16.8 percent last year to just over $28 billion. Foreign investment shrank in many spots around the world in 2023, but India, like China, was hit especially hard. Ms. Rai nonetheless foresees a new cycle of investment activity centered on Indian companies in health care technology, clean energy and artificial intelligence. Mr. Modi has promised a tenfold increase in India’s economy by 2047, in time for the 100th anniversary of its independence. To get there, Ms. Rai noted, the country will need an even faster rate of growth, and that means more of “these investors that we’re trying to draw in.”",mumbai india financial capital seen lot new

The guests’ views on India’s general election were equally varied. Some praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic achievements. Supporters of candidates challenging Mr. Modi’s party criticized what they saw as his disregard for minorities and democratic norms. “What is the vision for India in 2024?” the host, Somu Kumar, a manager at a cloud computing company, said recently of that winter potluck. “That gets a lot of people excited to talk.” India’s 35 million-member diaspora, roughly equivalent in population to Delhi’s metropolitan area, represents a tiny minority compared with the nearly one billion people who are eligible to take part in a six-week voting process that ends on Saturday. Expatriate Indians also cannot cast absentee ballots under India’s electoral laws. But the diaspora is heavily courted by India’s main political parties. Many of its members are from the country’s political and business elites, and voters back home want to know what they think. “When a person is abroad, people take interest and believe what they say is right,” said Adapa Prasad, the president of the American branch of Mr. Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The result, he said, is that the 10,000 or so B.J.P. volunteers in the United States alone can reach tens of thousands of voters. This spring, Indians around the world have been hosting gatherings and rallies for their preferred political parties. Many Indians abroad are proud of India’s rise and associate Mr. Modi with it. So much of the recent activity has supported his bid for a third term. In the United States, which the Indian government says is home to more than five million people of Indian origin, there have been pro-Modi rallies at Times Square, the Washington Monument, the Golden Gate Bridge and other landmarks. “Save India,” some of the pro-Modi posters said. Pro-Modi groups have also set up phone banks and held other events. In a Chicago suburb last month, Modi supporters wearing the B.J.P.’s saffron tassels lit a bonfire next to a Hindu school as part of a sacred fire ritual. India’s Hindu majority is a key constituency for Mr. Modi, who has been criticized for normalizing Hindu-nationalist policies in a country born as a secular republic. In Australia, a caravan of cars draped in saffron flags stretched for miles through Sydney in April. In Germany, Modi supporters who own restaurants in Berlin and Munich have been hosting gatherings for B.J.P. supporters, said Arun Varma, an entrepreneur who founded an e-commerce brand there. And in Britain, people have been visiting Hindu temples, as well as mosques and churches, to offer prayers for Mr. Modi’s electoral success, said Neil Lal, the chairman and president of the Indian Council of Scotland and the United Kingdom. “The election is the talk of the town,” Mr. Lal said from London. Mr. Modi has actively cultivated the diaspora’s support over the years, in part by filling stadiums around the world for rallies. A 2020 study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think tank in Washington, found that a majority of Indians abroad supported him over his rivals. Milan Vaishnav, a political scientist at Carnegie who studies India’s diaspora, said that expatriate Indians were a marginal force in Indian politics and that their campaign donations, while difficult to quantify, were small compared with the billions of dollars raised at home. “But gatherings of the diaspora have helped the B.J.P. create an image of global popularity,” he said. The B.J.P. isn’t the only party active outside India. The overseas arm of its main rival, the Indian National Congress, organizes events, distributes campaign posters and helps to place columns in newspapers. The Aam Aadmi Party, which is part of a parliamentary coalition led by the Congress Party, has overseas members who run phone banks and spread friendly memes about its candidates. Mr. Kumar, an Aam Aadmi supporter, said there was growing concern in the diaspora about a potential third Modi term. He said expatriates watching India worry about the recent marginalization of religious minorities, the assassination of a separatist and the jailings of opposition politicians. Some of the people who attend his potlucks, many of whom he plays cricket with, are stalwart Modi backers. Others are onetime Modi supporters who now question whether he should be re-elected. “I hope this also translates back toward India,” Mr. Kumar said. Outside of the main parties, independent activists who live abroad have criticized the government in ways that would be difficult in India, where Mr. Modi’s government has cracked down on dissent and jailed opposition leaders. One of those activists, Suresh Ediga, an Indian expatriate in New Jersey, organizes meetings on election reform and runs a blog that fact checks Indian politicians. “Independent institutions have collapsed under Modi,” he said. “That is more alarming than anything else.” While many in the diaspora have thrown themselves into campaigning, others have taken a more hands-off approach. Lion Hina Trivedi, a prominent social worker from Gujarat, the Indian state where Mr. Modi served as chief minister from 2001 to 2014, has known him for decades and met him on his trips to Washington. She said that after more than 45 years in Chicago, she was now more invested in her American community. But she still urges the Indians she knows to travel back home to vote, recalling her father’s advice: “Never forget about India.” “You should go,” she tells them. “Your voice matters.”",dish community center potluck indian expatriate near washington dc ranged chana masala popular northern indian chickpea curry idli southern indian rice cake guest view india general election equally varied praised prime minister narendra modis economic achievement supporter candidate challenging mr modis party criticized saw disregard minority democratic norm vision india host somu kumar manager cloud computing company said recently winter potluck get lot people excited talk india millionmember diaspora roughly equivalent population delhi metropolitan area represents tiny minority compared nearly one billion people eligible take part sixweek voting process end saturday expatriate indian also cast absentee ballot india electoral law diaspora heavily courted india main political party many member country political business elite voter back home want know think person abroad people take interest believe say right said adapa prasad president american branch mr modis ruling bharatiya janata party result said bjp volunteer united state alone reach ten thousand voter spring indian around world hosting gathering rally preferred political party many indian abroad proud india rise associate mr modi much recent activity supported bid third term united state indian government say home five million people indian origin promodi rally time square washington monument golden gate bridge landmark save india promodi poster said promodi group also set phone bank held event chicago suburb last month modi supporter wearing bjps saffron tassel lit bonfire next hindu school part sacred fire ritual india hindu majority key constituency mr modi criticized normalizing hindunationalist policy country born secular republic australia caravan car draped saffron flag stretched mile sydney april germany modi supporter restaurant berlin munich hosting gathering bjp supporter said arun varma entrepreneur founded ecommerce brand britain people visiting hindu temple well mosque church offer prayer mr modis electoral success said neil lal chairman president indian council scotland united kingdom election talk town mr lal said london mr modi actively cultivated diaspora support year part filling stadium around world rally study carnegie endowment international peace think tank washington found majority indian abroad supported rival milan vaishnav political scientist carnegie study india diaspora said expatriate indian marginal force indian politics campaign donation difficult quantify small compared billion dollar raised home gathering diaspora helped bjp create image global popularity said bjp isnt party active outside india overseas arm main rival indian national congress organizes event distributes campaign poster help place column newspaper aam aadmi party part parliamentary coalition led congress party overseas member run phone bank spread friendly meme candidate mr kumar aam aadmi supporter said growing concern diaspora potential third modi term said expatriate watching india worry recent marginalization religious minority assassination separatist jailings opposition politician people attend potluck many play cricket stalwart modi backer others onetime modi supporter question whether reelected hope also translates back toward india mr kumar said outside main party independent activist live abroad criticized government way would difficult india mr modis government cracked dissent jailed opposition leader one activist suresh ediga indian expatriate new jersey organizes meeting election reform run blog fact check indian politician independent institution collapsed modi said alarming anything else many diaspora thrown campaigning others taken handsoff approach lion hina trivedi prominent social worker gujarat indian state mr modi served chief minister known decade met trip washington said year chicago invested american community still urge indian know travel back home vote recalling father advice never forget india go tell voice matter
nytimes,New Delhi Sweats Through Its Hottest Recorded Day,"May 29, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/world/asia/india-delhi-hottest-day-ever.html,"New Delhi recorded its highest temperature ever measured on Wednesday — 126 degrees Fahrenheit, or 52.3 degrees Celsius — leaving residents of the Indian capital sweltering in a heat wave that has kept temperatures in several Indian states well above 110 degrees for weeks. In New Delhi, where walking out of the house felt like walking into an oven, officials feared that the electricity grid was being overwhelmed and that the city’s water supply might need rationing. The past 12 months have been the planet’s hottest ever recorded, and cities like Miami are experiencing extreme heat even before the arrival of summer. Scientists said this week that the average person on Earth had experienced 26 more days of abnormally high temperatures in the past year than would have been the case without human-induced climate change. Extreme heat can cause serious health issues and can be fatal. Although late-afternoon dust storms and light drizzle in New Delhi had brought hope of some reprieve on Wednesday, the weather station at Mungeshpur, northwest of the capital, reported a recording of 126 degrees around 2:30 p.m. Dr. Kuldeep Srivastava, a scientist at the regional meteorological center in Delhi, said it was the highest temperature ever recorded by the automatic weather monitoring system, which was installed in 2010. In a statement later on Wednesday evening, India’s meteorological department said the Mungeshpur station was “an outlier compared to other stations.” It said it was assessing whether that station’s recording of a higher temperature than other stations around Delhi was due to an error or a local mitigating factor. The previous record for the highest temperature, around 48 degrees Celsius — about 118.5 Fahrenheit — was repeatedly crossed in recent days. Three of New Delhi’s weather stations reported temperatures of 49.8 degree Celsius — 121.8 degrees Fahrenheit — or higher on Tuesday, setting a new record even before the 52.3 degree reading on Wednesday afternoon. For weeks now, temperatures in several states in India’s north have reached well over 110 degrees, and hospitals have been reporting an uptick in cases of heatstroke. In the Himalayan states, hundreds of forest fires have been reported. Deadly fires in crowded buildings are regular occurrences in India, with many of them caused by short circuits. The rising temperatures have increased concerns about the risks. Atul Garg, Delhi’s fire chief, said daily fire-related calls have crossed 200, the highest in the past decade. “Normally during this period in the last eight to 10 years we would receive 160 calls per day,” Mr. Garg said. “We are stretched in terms of manpower.” The heat wave has coincided with campaigning for India’s general election, with the last phase of voting set to take place on June 1. Candidates, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and opposition leaders, have continued holding large public rallies, despite the temperatures. Nitin Gadkari, a cabinet minister who is running for re-election, fainted from the heat while addressing a rally, and on Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi, the opposition leader, took a break during a speech to pour water from a bottle onto his head. “It’s quite hot, no?” he said. To help conserve water amid the extreme heat, Atishi Marlena, Delhi’s water minister, announced the deployment of 200 teams to crack down on waste and misuse. Fines will be imposed for activities such as washing cars with hoses, “overflow of water tanks” and “use of domestic water for construction or commercial” purposes, she said. Delhi’s lieutenant governor, V.K. Saxena, ordered measures to protect construction workers during the midday heat, and for water to be provided at bus stands. The state broadcaster reported that Mr. Saxena, who was appointed by Mr. Modi, had also called for construction workers to get “paid leave” between noon and 3 p.m. But it did not say how that would be implemented, particularly at a moment when the capital region’s administration is paralyzed by infighting between its lieutenant governor and the elected chief minister. Just how much the heat has affected daily life in the Indian capital was captured in the adjournment order of a consumer dispute court last week when the most intense period of the heat wave began. The presiding official, Suresh Kumar Gupta, complained that the room had no air-conditioning, and the water supply in the bathrooms was also affected. “There is too much heat in the courtroom, which led to sweating, as such it is difficult to hear arguments,” he said in the order. “In these circumstances, arguments cannot be heard, so case is adjourned.” Jitender Singh, 42, an auto rickshaw driver in the eastern part of the city, said that business was down by about a third because people were avoiding leaving their homes. He said he and his colleagues had frequently fallen sick. “But we must come on the road to support our families,” he added.",new delhi recorded highest temperature ever measured wednesday degree fahrenheit degree celsius leaving resident indian capital sweltering heat wave kept temperature several indian state well degree week new delhi walking house felt like walking oven official feared electricity grid overwhelmed city water supply might need rationing past month planet hottest ever recorded city like miami experiencing extreme heat even arrival summer scientist said week average person earth experienced day abnormally high temperature past year would case without humaninduced climate change extreme heat cause serious health issue fatal although lateafternoon dust storm light drizzle new delhi brought hope reprieve wednesday weather station mungeshpur northwest capital reported recording degree around pm dr kuldeep srivastava scientist regional meteorological center delhi said highest temperature ever recorded automatic weather monitoring system installed statement later wednesday evening india meteorological department said mungeshpur station outlier compared station said assessing whether station recording higher temperature station around delhi due error local mitigating factor previous record highest temperature around degree celsius fahrenheit repeatedly crossed recent day three new delhi weather station reported temperature degree celsius degree fahrenheit higher tuesday setting new record even degree reading wednesday afternoon week temperature several state india north reached well degree hospital reporting uptick case heatstroke himalayan state hundred forest fire reported deadly fire crowded building regular occurrence india many caused short circuit rising temperature increased concern risk atul garg delhi fire chief said daily firerelated call crossed highest past decade normally period last eight year would receive call per day mr garg said stretched term manpower heat wave coincided campaigning india general election last phase voting set take place june candidate including prime minister narendra modi opposition leader continued holding large public rally despite temperature nitin gadkari cabinet minister running reelection fainted heat addressing rally tuesday rahul gandhi opposition leader took break speech pour water bottle onto head quite hot said help conserve water amid extreme heat atishi marlena delhi water minister announced deployment team crack waste misuse fine imposed activity washing car hose overflow water tank use domestic water construction commercial purpose said delhi lieutenant governor vk saxena ordered measure protect construction worker midday heat water provided bus stand state broadcaster reported mr saxena appointed mr modi also called construction worker get paid leave noon pm say would implemented particularly moment capital region administration paralyzed infighting lieutenant governor elected chief minister much heat affected daily life indian capital captured adjournment order consumer dispute court last week intense period heat wave began presiding official suresh kumar gupta complained room airconditioning water supply bathroom also affected much heat courtroom led sweating difficult hear argument said order circumstance argument heard case adjourned jitender singh auto rickshaw driver eastern part city said business third people avoiding leaving home said colleague frequently fallen sick must come road support family added
nytimes,India y Bangladés: el ciclón Remal arrasa y deja al menos 23 muertos,"May 28, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/05/28/espanol/ciclon-remal-banglades-india.html,"[Estamos en WhatsApp. Empieza a seguirnos ahora] Al menos 23 personas fallecieron y millones se quedaron sin electricidad después de que el ciclón Remal, la primera tormenta tropical de la temporada, azotara el domingo Bangladés y la vecina India oriental. Remal, con vientos de más de 110 kilómetros por hora, dejó un rastro de destrucción, arrancando árboles y dañando el tendido eléctrico en toda la región, según las autoridades. La tormenta mató a 13 personas en Bangladés y dañó o destruyó más de 35.000 viviendas en las zonas costeras, afectando a unos 3,5 millones de personas, según las autoridades. Más de 13 millones de personas se quedaron sin electricidad el lunes por la noche, según funcionarios del Ministerio de Energía. El país del sur de Asia tiene 170 millones de habitantes. La tormenta también causó cortes de electricidad y daños en viviendas del estado indio de Bengala Occidental. El martes, las autoridades dijeron que al menos 10 personas habían muerto, y varias más estaban desaparecidas, después de que las fuertes lluvias de los remanentes del ciclón provocaran el derrumbe de una cantera en el estado indio del sur de Mizorán, vecino de Bangladés. La tormenta llegó tras semanas de intenso calor en la región, con temperaturas que alcanzaron los 40 grados centígrados. Remal tocó tierra cerca de Mongla, el puerto del sur de Bangladés, y de las vecinas islas Sagar, de India, hacia las 9 p. m. del domingo. Alrededor de un millón de personas fueron evacuadas de los pueblos costeros de Bangladés antes de que llegara la tormenta. La mayoría de esas aldeas quedaron inundadas, dejando a millones de personas vulnerables, según las autoridades. “Mientras el ciclón Remal azota las zonas costeras de Bangladés, más de 8,4 millones de personas, entre ellas 3,2 millones de niños, corren graves riesgos en materia de salud, nutrición, saneamiento y seguridad”, declaró en un comunicado Sheldon Yett, representante de UNICEF en Bangladés. La capital de Bangladés, Daca, en el interior del país, se vio afectada por lluvias torrenciales y fuertes vientos. La tormenta interrumpió los vuelos en el aeropuerto internacional Shah Amanat, en el sureste de Bangladés, y en el aeropuerto de Calcuta, en India. El martes, la tormenta se había debilitado, pero los meteorólogos de Bangladés e India advirtieron de que las lluvias torrenciales y los fuertes vientos podrían continuar durante unos días. Bangladés ha sufrido varias tormentas violentas en los últimos años. El pasado mes de mayo, un fuerte ciclón, Mocha, azotó Bangladés y Birmania y dejó varios muertos. La tormenta causó daños generalizados en los extensos campos de refugiados rohinyás de Cox’s Bazar, destruyendo más de 3000 cabañas y centros de aprendizaje construidos con tablillas de bambú y lonas de plástico. En Filipinas también se ha producido la primera tormenta tropical de la temporada. El tifón Ewiniar azotó el país isleño en la madrugada del sábado. La Oficina de Defensa Civil informó el lunes de que la tormenta había causado siete bajas.

Remal, which had measured winds of over 70 miles per hour, left a trail of destruction, uprooting trees and damaging power lines throughout the region, officials said. The storm killed 13 people in Bangladesh, and it damaged or destroyed more than 35,000 homes across the coastal areas, affecting about 3.5 million people, according to officials. More than 13 million people there lost electricity on Monday evening, according to power ministry officials. The South Asian country has a population of 170 million. The storm also caused power outages and damaged homes in the Indian state of West Bengal. On Tuesday, officials said that at least 10 people were killed, with several more missing, after heavy rains from the remnants of the cyclone caused a stone quarry to collapse in the northeastern Indian state of Mizoram, which neighbors Bangladesh. The storm hit after weeks of intense heat in the region, with temperatures reaching about 104 Fahrenheit, or 40 Celsius. Remal made landfall near Bangladesh’s southern port of Mongla and the neighboring Sagar Islands of India around 9 p.m. on Sunday. Around a million people were evacuated from Bangladesh’s coastal villages before the storm hit. Most of those villages were flooded, leaving millions of people vulnerable, officials said. “As Cyclone Remal hits the coastal areas of Bangladesh, over 8.4 million people, including 3.2 million children, are at high health, nutrition, sanitation and safety risks,” Sheldon Yett, a UNICEF representative to Bangladesh, said in a statement. Bangladesh’s inland capital, Dhaka was hit with heavy rain and strong winds. The storm disrupted flights at Shah Amanat International Airport in southeastern Bangladesh and at Kolkata Airport in India. By Tuesday, the storm had weakened, but meteorologists in Bangladesh and India warned that heavy rain and strong winds could continue for a few days. Bangladesh has been hit with several violent storms in recent years. Last May, a severe cyclone, Mocha, hit Bangladesh and Myanmar and left several people dead. The storm caused widespread damage in the sprawling Rohingya refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, destroying over 3,000 shanties and learning centers made of bamboo slats and plastic tarpaulin. The Philippines has also seen its first tropical storm of the season. Typhoon Ewiniar hit the island nation early Saturday morning. The Office of Civil Defense reported Monday that there were seven casualties from the storm. The storm had gusts of over 40 miles per hour, according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration.",least people killed million left without power cyclone remal first tropical storm season hit bangladesh neighboring eastern india sunday remal measured wind mile per hour left trail destruction uprooting tree damaging power line throughout region official said storm killed people bangladesh damaged destroyed home across coastal area affecting million people according official million people lost electricity monday evening according power ministry official south asian country population million storm also caused power outage damaged home indian state west bengal tuesday official said least people killed several missing heavy rain remnant cyclone caused stone quarry collapse northeastern indian state mizoram neighbor bangladesh storm hit week intense heat region temperature reaching fahrenheit celsius remal made landfall near bangladesh southern port mongla neighboring sagar island india around pm sunday around million people evacuated bangladesh coastal village storm hit village flooded leaving million people vulnerable official said cyclone remal hit coastal area bangladesh million people including million child high health nutrition sanitation safety risk sheldon yett unicef representative bangladesh said statement bangladesh inland capital dhaka hit heavy rain strong wind storm disrupted flight shah amanat international airport southeastern bangladesh kolkata airport india tuesday storm weakened meteorologist bangladesh india warned heavy rain strong wind could continue day bangladesh hit several violent storm recent year last may severe cyclone mocha hit bangladesh myanmar left several people dead storm caused widespread damage sprawling rohingya refugee camp cox bazar destroying shanty learning center made bamboo slat plastic tarpaulin philippine also seen first tropical storm season typhoon ewiniar hit island nation early saturday morning office civil defense reported monday seven casualty storm storm gust mile per hour according philippine atmospheric geophysical astronomical service administration
nytimes,"Leaflet by Leaflet, a Few Aging Activists Fight India’s Tide of Bigotry","May 28, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/world/asia/india-activists.html,"One recent morning, Roop Rekha Verma, an 80-year-old peace activist and former university leader, walked through a north Indian neighborhood prone to sectarian strife and parked herself near a tea shop. From her sling bag, she pulled out a bundle of pamphlets bearing messages of religious tolerance and mutual coexistence and began handing them to passers-by. “Talk to each other. Don’t let anyone divide you,” one read in Hindi. Spreading those simple words is an act of bravery in today’s India. Ms. Verma and others like her are waging a lonely battle against a tide of hatred and bigotry increasingly normalized by India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his deputies have vilified the country’s minorities in a yearslong campaign that has escalated during the current national election, the small band of aging activists has built bridges and preached harmony between religious groups. They have continued to hit the pavement even as the price for dissent and free speech has become high, trying to keep the flame alive for the nonsectarian ideal embedded in India’s constitution and in their own memories. More than three dozen human rights defenders, poets, journalists and opposition politicians face charges, including under antiterrorism laws, for criticizing Mr. Modi’s divisive policies, according to rights groups. (The government has said little about the charges, other than repeating its line that the law takes its own course.) The crackdown has had a chilling effect on many Indians. “That is where the role of these civil society activists becomes more important,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, a deputy director at Human Rights Watch. “Despite a crackdown, they are refusing to cow down, leading them to hold placards, distributing fliers, to revive a message that once was taken for granted.” The use of posters and pamphlets to raise public awareness is a time-tested practice among Indian activists. Revolutionaries fighting for independence from British colonizers employed them to drum up support and mobilize ordinary Indians. Today, village leaders use them to spread awareness about health and other government programs. Such old-school outreach may seem quixotic in the digital age. Every day, India’s social media spaces, reaching hundreds of millions of people, are inundated with anti-Muslim vitriol promoted by the B.J.P. and its associated right-wing organizations. During the national election that ends next week, Mr. Modi and his party have targeted Muslims directly, by name, with brazen attacks both online and in campaign speeches. (The B.J.P. rejects accusations that it discriminates against Muslims, noting that government welfare programs under its supervision assist all Indians equally.) Those who have worked in places torn apart by sectarian violence say polarization can be combated only by going to people on the streets and making them understand its dangers. Merely showing up can help. For Ms. Verma, the seeds of her activism were planted during her childhood, when she listened to horror stories of the sectarian violence that left hundreds of thousands dead during the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947. Later, as a university philosophy professor, she fought caste discrimination and religious divides both inside and outside the classroom. She opposed patriarchal attitudes even as slurs were thrown at her. In the early 1980s, when she noticed that the names of mothers were excluded from student admission forms, she pressed for their inclusion and won. But more than anything else, it was the campaign to build a major Hindu temple in the town of Ayodhya in her home state of Uttar Pradesh that gave Ms. Verma’s life a new meaning. In 1992, a Hindu mob demolished a centuries-old mosque there, claiming that the site had previously held a Hindu temple. Deadly riots followed. This past January, three decades later, the Ayodhya temple opened, inaugurated by Mr. Modi. It was a significant victory for a Hindu nationalist movement whose maligning and marginalizing of Muslims is exactly what Ms. Verma has devoted herself to opposing. The Hindu majority, she said, has a responsibility to protect minorities, “not become complicit in their demonization.” While the government’s incitement of religious enmity is new in India, the sectarian divisions themselves are not. One activist, Vipin Kumar Tripathi, 76, a former physics professor at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi, said he had started gathering students after classes and educating them about the dangers of “religious radicalization” in the early 1990s. Today, Mr. Tripathi travels to different parts of India with a message of peace. Recently, he stood in a corner of a busy train station in northeastern New Delhi. As office workers, students and laborers ran toward platforms, he handed information sheets and brochures to anyone who extended a hand. His materials addressed some of the most provocative issues in India: the troubles in Kashmir, where the Modi government has rescinded the majority-Muslim region’s semi-autonomy; the politics over the Ayodhya temple; and ordinary citizens’ rights to question their government. “To respect God and to pretend to do that for votes are two different things,” read one of his handouts. At the station, Anirudh Saxena, a tall man in his early 30s with a pencil mustache, stopped and looked Mr. Tripathi straight in the eyes. “Sir, why are you doing this every week?” Mr. Saxena asked. “Read this,” Mr. Tripathi told Mr. Saxena, handing him a small 10-page booklet. “This explains why we should read books and understand history instead of reading WhatsApp garbage and extracting pleasure out of someone’s pain.” Mr. Saxena smiled, nodded his head and put the booklet in his handbag before disappearing into the crowd. If just 10 out of a thousand people read his materials, Mr. Tripathi said, his job is done. “When truth becomes the casualty, you can only fight it on the streets,” he said. Shabnam Hashmi, 66, another activist based in New Delhi, said she had helped distribute about four million pamphlets in the state of Gujarat after sectarian riots there in 2002. More than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, died in the communal violence, which happened under the watch of Mr. Modi, who was the state’s top leader at the time. During that period, she and her colleagues were harassed by right-wing activists, who threw stones at her and filed police complaints. In 2016, months after Mr. Modi became prime minister, the government prohibited foreign funding for her organization. She has continued her street activism nonetheless. “It is the most effective way of reaching the people directly,” she said. “What it does is, it somehow gives people courage to fight fear and keep resisting.” “We might not be able to stop this craziness,” she added, “but that doesn’t mean we should stop fighting.” Even before Mr. Modi’s rise, said Ms. Verma, the activist in Uttar Pradesh, governments never “showered roses” on her when she was doing things like leading marches and bringing together warring factions after flare-ups of religious violence. Over the decades, she has been threatened with prison and bundled into police vehicles. “But it was never so bad,” she said, as it has now become under Mr. Modi. The space for activism may completely vanish, Ms. Verma said, as his party becomes increasingly intolerant of any scrutiny. For now, she said, activists “are, sadly, just giving proof of our existence: that we may be demoralized, but we are still alive. Otherwise, hatred has seeped so deep it will take decades to rebuild trust.”",one recent morning roop rekha verma yearold peace activist former university leader walked north indian neighborhood prone

nytimes,Two Deadly Fires in Rapid Succession Expose India’s Gaps in Safety,"May 26, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/world/asia/india-fire-death-infants-safety.html,"Seven newborn babies lost their lives after their New Delhi neonatal clinic was engulfed in flames. What remained of the two-story building on Sunday morning was its burned facade, a charred spiral staircase and oxygen cylinders covered in soot. Hours earlier, in the western Indian city of Rajkot, an amusement park of trampolines and bowling lanes had turned to an inferno. The families of people who had come to enjoy a discounted offer of all-you-can-play to celebrate the start of summer vacation were left trying to identify bodies among the at least 27 dead, many of them children too charred to be recognizable. As after every such deadly episode, political leaders were quick with messages of condolence, announcements of arrests, creations of inquiries — and finger-pointing. But to analysts and experts who had warned for years about India’s abysmal fire preparedness, the back-to-back disasters on Saturday were the latest reminder that systemic change to make the country safer was still missing. Building safety compliance remains abysmal across India, the world’s most populous nation. The fire services have long faced huge gaps in the numbers of stations, personnel and equipment. Government audits after mass-casualty disasters unearth glaring shortcomings, with little follow-up. Though the number has gone down over the past decade, more than 20 fire-related deaths occur every day in India, according to government statistics. Many of the fires — particularly in crowded urban centers — are caused by short circuits, an alarming prospect as India faces an intense period of heat waves that strains electrical wires. R.C. Sharma, a former fire service chief in Delhi, said that one major problem is that fire regulations go unenforced. Another is that fire-response resources have failed to keep up with urbanization that is happening rapidly and often without regard to safety. “We are not in a good condition,” Mr. Sharma said. “In other countries, you have fire hydrants and everything at all the places. But in India, we don’t even have drinking water around the clock, so we do not think of having firefighting water around the clock.” Data provided to the Indian Parliament in 2019 by the country’s Home Ministry painted a dire state of preparedness, with major deficiencies. India had only 3,377 fire stations when regulations called for 8,559. The shortfall in personnel and equipment was even worse. The fire service had about 55,000 people, when a half-million were called for, and 7,300 vehicles, when it should have had 33,000. It is unclear how much of those gaps have been filled in the five years since. A new $600 million program for expansion and modernization of the fire service announced by India’s central government last year, with additional resources to be pooled from the states, suggests a lot of it remains undone. Government audits have repeatedly flagged the vulnerability of public buildings, particularly hospitals. A study last year of hospitals across India where there had been a fire in the past decade showed that half were not legally compliant on safety measures. Private and public hospitals were about equally bad. Short circuits were the cause of the fires in nearly 90 percent of the episodes. In one state, after a fire killed 10 babies in a neonatal care unit, assessments found that more than 80 percent of the state’s hospitals had never carried out fire safety audits; half had never conducted fire drills; and only a few had fire safety certificates. “The tendency is to comply in letter, not spirit,” said S.A. Abbasi, an emeritus professor at Pondicherry University, who was the lead author of the report. “Lapses and laxity continue to be the norms rather than exceptions.” What caused the fire at the amusement park in Rajkot, in the state of Gujarat, was not known. But the initial police complaint, a copy of which was seen by The New York Times, made clear that the facility lacked both a clearance certificate from the fire department and effective equipment and protocols in case of fire. Ilesh Kher, Rajkot’s chief fire officer, said the fire at the facility had started just before 6 p.m., and the flames were contained in a little over an hour. He did not know how many people were present when the blaze broke out, but witness accounts in local news suggested over 100. The building appeared to be a temporary structure made of iron poles and metal sheets. Daksh Kujadia, a teenager who had gone bowling with a cousin, said the fire had started under an emergency exit. About 30 people became trapped in the bowling lanes. “We didn’t have an option but to tear the metal sheet in a corner,” he told local news media. “Fifteen of us got out by jumping from there.” The two-story Delhi neonatal hospital that caught fire just before midnight was operating out of a residential building. Neighbors described frequent disputes, as trucks often blocked the road outside the hospital to unload large cylinders of oxygen. “A few of us climbed on top of each other and climbed into the building from the back side,” said Ravi Gupta, who lives in the area and helped evacuate a dozen babies from the back of the building as the front caught fire and multiple explosions were heard as oxygen cylinders burst. “We brought ladders and bedsheets from our houses. I carried infants in my hands from the fire and brought them down.” Health care in Delhi, India’s capital, has in recent years has been caught in a messy political fight between the central government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Delhi’s elected local government, run by a smaller opposition party, the Aam Aadmi Party, or A.A.P. The local administration has accused Mr. Modi of using his control over government officials to handicap its efforts. Accusations continued to fly after Saturday’s deadly hospital fire. Pankaj Luthra, a local official affiliated with Modi’s party in the neighborhood where the hospital is, blamed the A.A.P. for giving the hospital its license. There had been, he said, complaints of illegal oxygen cylinder refilling at the hospital. Saurabh Bhardwaj, A.A.P.’s health minister for Delhi, released a statement complaining that the most senior official in Delhi’s health department — a civil servant technically supervised by Mr. Bhardwaj, but in fact answering to the central government — was ignoring his calls and messages. “I got to know about this incident through a media flash,” Mr. Bhardwaj said.",seven newborn baby lost life new delhi neonatal clinic engulfed flame remained twostory building sunday morning burned facade charred spiral staircase oxygen cylinder covered soot hour earlier western indian city rajkot amusement park trampoline bowling lane turned inferno family people come enjoy discounted offer allyoucanplay celebrate start summer vacation left trying identify body among least dead many child charred recognizable every deadly episode political leader quick message condolence announcement arrest creation inquiry fingerpointing analyst expert warned year india abysmal fire preparedness backtoback disaster saturday latest reminder systemic change make country safer still missing building safety compliance remains abysmal across india world populous nation fire service long faced huge gap number station personnel equipment government audit masscasualty disaster unearth glaring shortcoming little followup though number gone past decade firerelated death occur every day india according government statistic many fire particularly crowded urban center caused short circuit alarming prospect india face intense period heat wave strain electrical wire rc sharma former fire service chief delhi said one major problem fire regulation go unenforced another fireresponse resource failed keep urbanization happening rapidly often without regard safety good condition mr sharma said country fire hydrant everything place india dont even drinking water around clock think firefighting water around clock data provided indian parliament country home ministry painted dire state preparedness major deficiency india fire station regulation called shortfall personnel equipment even worse fire service people halfmillion called vehicle unclear much gap filled five year since new million program expansion modernization fire service announced india central government last year additional resource pooled state suggests lot remains undone government audit repeatedly flagged vulnerability public building particularly hospital study last year hospital across india fire past decade showed half legally compliant safety measure private public hospital equally bad short circuit cause fire nearly percent episode one state fire killed baby neonatal care unit assessment found percent state hospital never carried fire safety audit half never conducted fire drill fire safety certificate tendency comply letter spirit said sa abbasi emeritus professor pondicherry university lead author report lapse laxity continue norm rather exception caused fire amusement park rajkot state gujarat known initial police complaint copy seen new york time made clear facility lacked clearance certificate fire department effective equipment protocol case fire ilesh kher rajkots chief fire officer said fire facility started pm flame contained little hour know many people present blaze broke witness account local news suggested building appeared temporary structure made iron pole metal sheet daksh kujadia teenager gone bowling cousin said fire started emergency exit people became trapped bowling lane didnt option tear metal sheet corner told local news medium fifteen u got jumping twostory delhi neonatal hospital caught fire midnight operating residential building neighbor described frequent dispute truck often blocked road outside hospital unload large cylinder oxygen u climbed top climbed building back side said ravi gupta life area helped evacuate dozen baby back building front caught fire multiple explosion heard oxygen cylinder burst brought ladder bedsheets house carried infant hand fire brought health care delhi india capital recent year caught messy political fight central government prime minister narendra modi delhi elected local government run smaller opposition party aam aadmi party aap local administration accused mr modi using control government official handicap effort accusation continued fly saturday deadly hospital fire pankaj luthra local official affiliated modis party neighborhood hospital blamed aap giving hospital license said complaint illegal oxygen cylinder refilling hospital saurabh bhardwaj aaps health minister delhi released statement complaining senior official delhi health department civil servant technically supervised mr bhardwaj fact answering central government ignoring call message got know incident medium flash mr bhardwaj said
nytimes,"I’m an Indian Muslim, and I’m Scared to Say So","May 26, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/opinion/india-muslim-modi-election.html,"I used to answer the phone with “Salam.” Not anymore. I don’t want people to know I’m a Muslim. There is little that would identify me as Muslim to begin with, aside from my name. I don’t wear a skullcap, and in public I avoid wearing the loosefitting Pathani kurta and peppering my speech with Urdu words, all of which are identity markers for Indian Muslims. But in the India of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you can’t take any chances. For 10 years, Mr. Modi’s Hindu-chauvinist government has vilified the nation’s 200 million Muslims as dangerous undesirables. Recently, he took that rhetoric to a new low during the six weeks of voting in India’s national elections — which are widely expected to win him a third consecutive five-year term — directly referring to Muslims as “infiltrators” in a country that he and his followers seek to turn into a pure Hindu state. As offensive as that was, it is sadly familiar to Indian Muslims like me who — after a decade of denigration, violence and murder — live in daily fear of being identified and attacked, forcing us into self-denial to protect ourselves. India is home to one of the world’s largest Muslim populations. Islam came here around 1,300 years ago, and Indian Muslims descend from natives of this land who converted to Islam centuries ago. Many Indian Muslims fought against British colonization, and millions rejected the 1947 partition of the country into a predominantly Hindu India and a mostly Muslim Pakistan. India is our home, and people like me are proud patriots. But Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalism has made us the targets in what might be the largest radicalization of people on the planet. Its seeds were planted with the founding in 1925 of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing Hindu organization that sought the establishment of a fully Hindu state in India and was inspired by the European fascism of that era. When Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party — a political offshoot of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh — won elections in 2014 and he became prime minister, he and his followers saw it as the civilizational moment that Hindus had been waiting for. Mr. Modi was the god-king who would free Hindu civilization from centuries of domination, first by a series of Muslim rulers culminating with the Mughal empire that ruled India for around three centuries and then by the British colonizers who followed. Islamophobia isn’t new to India, and Muslims also faced prejudice and recurring violence during the generations in which the liberal upper-caste Hindu elite dominated the nation’s secular democratic politics. But under Mr. Modi’s right-wing leadership, hatred of Muslims has effectively become state policy. India is now a country where police have been accused of standing by as Hindus attack Muslims, where the killers of religious minorities go unpunished and where Hindu extremists openly call for the genocide of Muslims. Protest, and you run the risk of having a Hindu mob unleashed on you. That’s what happened after Mr. Modi’s government in 2019 pushed through a citizenship law that discriminates against Muslims and his party promised to expel “infiltrators” from the country. When Indian Muslims protested, one of Mr. Modi’s supporters responded with a provocative speech that is blamed for sparking deadly clashes between Hindus and Muslims in Delhi in February 2020. Police were accused of looking the other way as Muslims had their shops destroyed, were assaulted and were even killed. Bulldozers have become a symbol of this state terrorism — rolled out at right-wing rallies, tattooed on the arms of Modi supporters and featured in Hindu nationalist songs — because of their use in areas governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party to illegally knock down the homes and businesses of Muslims who dare to speak up. Some states have essentially made Muslim-Hindu relationships illegal, based on an absurd Hindu conspiracy theory that Muslim men are seducing Hindu women as part of a long-term plan to turn India into a Muslim nation. The liberal Hindu elite, instead of acknowledging its role in enabling the sentiments on which Mr. Modi has capitalized, has done little to help, other than to ineffectually express nostalgia for a lost Hindu tolerance. And there is little that Indian Muslims can do within the political system: Although the Muslim share of India’s population has slowly grown to 14 percent, the percentage of Parliament members who are Muslim has declined to less than 5 percent today, compared with 9 percent in the early 1980s. The Indian Muslim response to our subjugation has largely been a deafening silence. Many of us are simply unwilling to speak out against the Modi government’s bitter bargain: that for us to exist as Indian citizens, we must meekly accept historical revisionism, dehumanization and demonization. This debasement, and the knowledge that you are essentially outside the protection of the law, kills something inside you. You take precautions to protect yourself. My mother no longer packs mutton for me to take back to Delhi after I visit her, as she used to. She’s afraid it will be mistaken for beef: Dozens of Muslims have reportedly been killed or assaulted by Hindu mobs on suspicion of killing cows — which are sacred to Hindus — or for eating or possessing beef. Muslim parents now routinely repeat a litany of don’ts to their children: Don’t appear Muslim in public, don’t reveal your name, don’t enter Hindu areas or travel alone and don’t get pulled into any potential confrontation. While we caution one another to blend in, it’s difficult to reconcile with the whole thing. Each of us has something embedded in our sense of self and expression that is particularly painful to erase. And the sort of physical markers we are trying to hide are not even wholly specific to Muslims in India. My cousin likes to wear his Pathani kurta, but so do many Hindus. My youngest sister prefers to keep her head covered, but so do many Hindu women, although not with a hijab. I’m attached to using certain Urdu words that have long been a feature of India’s syncretic culture and have been used widely by Hindus, too. Self-denial leads to deep frustration. Now during gatherings with friends and family, we avoid politics; discussing the elephant in the room only reminds us of our helplessness. The cumulative weight of all this has created a mental health crisis of fear and depression among Muslims. Yet because of a desperate shortage of mental health professionals in India and a limited understanding of our new reality by many non-Muslim therapists, many Muslims are left to cope on their own. I was hesitant to write this essay. I am not supposed to protest, to speak up. When I sometimes do, posting online about it, the typical response is, “Go to Pakistan.” But why would I leave? I am an Indian. I was born here, as were my ancestors who opposed the religious basis of the partition with Pakistan and believed in the Indian ideals of secular democracy. But many Muslims have fled over the years, emigrating to Australia, Canada, Britain, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia or elsewhere because of the worsening political climate. Many who can’t afford to emigrate are moving out of the predominantly Hindu or mixed neighborhoods where they lived for decades, to poorer Muslim areas for safety. Two of my Muslim friends and I used to own apartments in a suburban area near New Delhi where many upper-caste Hindus lived. But in 2020, after the discriminatory citizenship law was passed, a Hindu mob charged through the neighborhood baying for Muslim blood. My two friends soon moved out. I kept my apartment, but in the elevator one evening in 2022, I overheard two men discussing how many katua (a derogatory term for Muslims that refers to circumcision) lived in the area. I moved out the next day. Sadly, Hindu friends and colleagues of mine also have become colder and more distant and are dropping out of contact. On June 1, India’s voting period comes to a close. It looms as a day of dread for Muslims like me. According to most projections, it will be another victory for Mr. Modi — and further validation of mob rule and the debasement of 200 million Muslims by a hubristic Hindu majority.",used answer phone

nytimes,Free Food? Modi Makes Sure Every Indian Knows Whom to Thank for It.,"May 26, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/world/asia/india-welfare-modi.html,"Durga Prasad, an 80-year-old farmer, was resting under the shade of a tree in front of his home when the party workers came. An app on their smartphones could tell them in an instant who Mr. Prasad was, whom he might vote for — and why he should be grateful to India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. “You get installments of 2,000 rupees, right?” asked a local official from Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. Mr. Prasad concurred. He receives $72 a year through a farmers’ welfare program started and branded by Mr. Modi. “Do you get rations?” the official then asked, though he already knew the answer. He had made his point. Such handouts are among the most distinctive parts of Mr. Modi’s mass appeal. The country’s new airports, diplomatic prestige and booming stock markets may look like Mr. Modi’s calling card, but for the 95 percent of Indians who earn too little to file income taxes, small infusions of cash and household goods matter more. And Mr. Modi’s party is organized to make the most of them in the national election that ends early next month. India’s welfare programs are vast in reach and scope. Under the biggest, 821 million Indians are entitled to five-kilogram (11-pound) sacks of free rice or wheat every month. The government started doling out grain to prevent hunger early in the pandemic and has since committed $142 billion to the program. Mr. Modi’s face began appearing on the sacks in January. Another prime minister-branded program has helped people build 15 million homes since 2015, at a price tag of $3 billion a year; home improvements and additions are covered, too. The government has also footed the cost of millions of toilets, and it is working to provide piped drinking water to every home. The foundation of this expanded welfare system was laid soon after Mr. Modi became prime minister in 2014. Bank accounts, also “P.M.” branded, became available to all Indians who lacked them, meshed with a universal-ID program started by the previous government. The accounts gave the state valuable information about the financial lives of even its poorest citizens. And they opened the way for “direct benefit transfers,” money that bypasses the sometimes corrupt local officials who once distributed welfare — appearing to come instead from Mr. Modi himself. These transfers grew to $76 billion in the last fiscal year. But Mr. Modi’s budgets have not become profligate. That is in part because government spending on education and health care — long-term investments — has shrunk as a share of the economy as branded welfare programs have proliferated. Spending on a guaranteed-employment program associated with Mr. Modi’s opponents has also fallen. Whatever the motivation behind them, the tangible food and household benefits prioritized by Mr. Modi have relieved Indians’ pain as the economy slowed before the pandemic, collapsed during its first year and then recovered unevenly. The Hindu-nationalist government distributes the assistance equally among all religious groups, even if it does not receive many votes from some of them. The handouts are perhaps the most powerful thing Mr. Modi can point to when claiming credit for improving the lives of his fellow Indians, hundreds of millions of whom remain desperate for reliable jobs with decent pay. Vinod Misra, the local B.J.P. official who recently visited Mr. Prasad in Amethi, a district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, explained that in poorer places where people once died of hunger, “our party is working especially for programs that touch everyone.” “All we have to do is go and tell the family, ‘Brother, this roof you got, who made it happen?’” Mr. Misra said. In a country where 80 percent of the population is either rural or poor, people are dead serious about getting something in exchange for their votes, said Pradeep Gupta, the director of Axis My India, a polling outfit. If a politician delivers on promises, “the people elect you again and again and again,” Mr. Gupta said. Everything else is “marketing.” The B.J.P.’s follow-up with voters is the end result of a gargantuan effort that leverages its ideologically committed core membership, its funding, its nationwide organization and, increasingly, its sophisticated management of data. In the temple town of Pushkar, west of Amethi within the Hindi-speaking “cow belt” that is a stronghold of the B.J.P., another local party worker explained the virtue of an app called Saral. With a few swipes and taps, the worker, Shakti Singh Rathore, shared a bird’s-eye view of his neighbors, whom he intended to marshal for Mr. Modi. There are 241 “booths,” or polling stations, in Pushkar’s constituency, each with its own mapped boundaries. Mr. Rathore flicked open the information for one of the booths he was supervising. His targets were not just voters, but beneficiaries, or “labharthis” — an important new term of art in the ground campaign. “The labharthis’ names are all listed here,” Mr. Rathore said. One man he named had received a cooking gas cylinder — “here is his address and postal code and phone number.” Another had gotten cash from the farmers’ welfare program. “All the data is here,” Mr. Rathore said. Anyone can download Saral through the Apple or Google Play stores for campaign updates, though only enlisted B.J.P. workers get to explore its databases. The party’s national leadership has said it uses Saral to connect more than six million of its workers. They can both retrieve and upload data about voters and beneficiaries. Voters do not seem bothered, or are at least not surprised, that so much information about their relationships with the national government is carried door to door by political workers. Mr. Misra said he did not know exactly how all the personal information made its way into the app. Other local-level workers said they assumed that the data had been provided by the government itself, given its accuracy. Amit Malviya, the B.J.P.’s head of information and technology, said at a start-up conference in December that the 30 terabytes of data had been collected manually by the party over the past 10 elections. Saral does many other things that are useful for the party’s ground game. It tracks workers’ outreach and measures them against one another by their performance, in effect “gamifying” the hard slog of canvassing. It also gives the workers the chance to help smooth out voters’ receipt of their benefits, erasing the distinction between partisan politics and government work. Mr. Modi himself said to a TV crew this month that he had told party workers to gather information about voters who had not received their benefits and to “assure them that it’s the Modi guarantee — they will get it in my third term.” Ajay Singh Gaur, a B.J.P. worker who accompanied Mr. Misra for the doorstepping around Amethi, found himself drawn into a long exchange with Dinesh Maurya, a farmer who complained that a faulty electrical wire had fallen onto his wheat field. “My whole crop was burned down, and I haven’t got a single coin’s worth of compensation,” Mr. Maurya said. Mr. Gaur assured Mr. Maurya that he would get him the money the state owed him. “I have spoken to the officer in charge” at the generating station, he said. “I will get it done.”",durga prasad yearold

nytimes,Is Modi Worried? India’s Long-Deflated Opposition Finds Some Momentum.,"May 23, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/world/asia/india-election-modi-opposition.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi entered India’s general election projecting supreme confidence. “Ab ki baar, 400 paar” went his party’s slogan, meaning this time his side was gunning to surpass 400 seats in the lower house of Parliament, a staggering majority. But as the seven-week voting period enters its final stretch, with results expected on June 4, India is witnessing something unusual from its powerful leader. It is seeing him sweat. As Mr. Modi crisscrosses the country for rallies in 100-degree heat, he has often appeared on the defensive, and sometimes rattled. He has frequently set aside his party’s main campaign message — that India is rising under his leadership — to counter his opponents’ portrayal of him as favoring business and caste elites. He has resorted to stoking anti-Muslim sentiments to fend off attempts to split his Hindu support base, only to deny his own words later. Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., is still a heavy favorite. But it is finding that the political opposition, counted out after big losses to Mr. Modi in the previous two national elections, has some fight left in it. The opposition has found traction in challenging Mr. Modi’s control over the national narrative. With the broadcast media cowed by him, opposition leaders have turned to online platforms to find an audience for a pitch focused on economic and social justice, painting the prime minister as a primary culprit in India’s growing inequality. Before the election, often-bickering opposition parties united in a grand alliance to confront a shared threat: what they call Mr. Modi’s mission to cripple them and remake the country into one-party rule. The alliance lost precious time in the months before the vote, bogged down by internal differences. But it has largely held together despite Mr. Modi’s efforts to lure away some of its members and sideline others with legal actions. The alliance hopes that this translates into an improved electoral showing, after scattered votes for opposition parties in the 2019 election worked to Mr. Modi’s advantage. To have any hope of cutting significantly into the governing party’s existing strong majority in Parliament, the opposition will have to flip a large number of seats in the more populous north, where the B.J.P. is well entrenched, and hold its ground in the more prosperous south. “The opposition realized it was now or never,” said Arati Jerath, a political analyst in New Delhi. “It had to fight Modi with all the weapons it could muster or face certain death.” Analysts say elections that focus on local issues favor the opposition. This spring, Mr. Modi has again made a parliamentary election, contested across more than 540 seats, into a presidential-style national referendum on his own huge popularity and his achievements. But it has become clear that, a decade into his rule, his ability to steer elections away from local concerns — and cover for his party’s parochial struggles and infighting — is waning. The opposition has tried to take advantage with an energized ground game. In the lead-up to the vote, Mr. Modi intensified a political crackdown. Chief ministers of two opposition-controlled states were thrown in jail, and the bank accounts of the Indian National Congress, the main opposition party, were essentially frozen. “But people started campaigning door to door, village to village, state to state. So that has become really a groundwork for the opposition,” Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the Congress party, said in an interview. “Now they are frustrated,” he added, referring to the B.J.P. The Congress party is trying to pull itself out of an immense hole. The rise of caste-based regional parties marginalized the once-dominant Congress in India’s electorally crucial north, and Mr. Modi’s ascendence set it back further. Mr. Modi, who had spent a lifetime working his way up from a humble background, easily cast the face of the Congress, Rahul Gandhi, as a detached, lightweight beneficiary of dynastic politics. Just how far the Congress is trying to distance itself from that impression is evident in its election manifesto — both in form and substance. The party’s 2019 manifesto had a fresh-faced Mr. Gandhi front and center, with a message of jobs and economic development. In the 2024 document, he wears a graying beard, a nod to the time he spent connecting with rural India during two cross-country journeys since 2022, one of them covering 2,000 miles by foot. If that was not enough, next to him is the 81-year-old Mr. Kharge, elected in 2022 as the Congress president. His half a century in politics, and his background as a Dalit at the bottom of India’s rigid caste hierarchy, helps offset Mr. Modi’s personal story. The Congress’s campaign promises — from cash transfers to poor women to a “guarantee of first jobs” for young people through one-year paid apprenticeships — shows that it has learned from its successes in India’s southern states, said Sugata Srinivasaraju, the author of a book on Mr. Gandhi’s struggles in leading his party. “This is good,” Mr. Srinivasaraju said. “But the Congress does not have any emotional or cultural argument to counter” the B.J.P., with its Hindu-nationalist ideology. The closest the Congress has come is its effort to fuse two issues: longstanding caste inequality and rising unemployment. India’s Constitution sets aside about half of government jobs and seats in higher education for the middle and lower ranks in the caste system. With the economy struggling to create enough private-sector jobs, these government positions are seen as crucial for any hope of economic mobility. The Congress’s call for a census of Indians by caste — there has been no official national data on the size of each caste for decades — appears to be striking a chord. The party says such an exercise would ensure that marginalized Indians get their rightful share of slots. That push is also furthering two charges aimed at Mr. Modi: that he has overseen an economy that benefits only billionaires, and that his party has an upper-caste bias. While it is true that the B.J.P. was once an upper-caste, urban party, Mr. Modi has broadened its base by bringing in lower castes. But his response to the charge suggests he is nervous that the label may stick. “He’s for the rich,” Mr. Kharge said at a large rally in Mumbai. “He has done nothing for the poor.” Behind Mr. Kharge were the leaders of several parties in the alliance, each of whom would draw on a grievance to depict Mr. Modi as dangerous for India. One of them, Arvind Kejriwal, made a particularly personal case that Mr. Modi is trying to turn the country into something like Russia under President Vladimir V. Putin — “one nation, one leader.” “I am coming straight from jail,” Mr. Kejriwal began his speech. His Aam Aadmi Party holds power in the Delhi region and in the northern state of Punjab. Its expansion is a threat to Mr. Modi, whose government arrested Mr. Kejriwal over corruption allegations just before the election, creating the absurd reality in which India’s capital was being run from a jail cell. Mr. Kejriwal managed to get a three-week bail during the campaigning. As he jumps from rally to rally across the country, his connection with crowds makes clear why Mr. Modi would have liked to keep him behind bars. In Mumbai, he painted India under Mr. Modi as a dystopia where anyone who gets in the prime minister’s way will be locked up. Mr. Kejriwal said he had been kept under the surveillance of multiple cameras in jail — “watching what time I wake up, what time I go to the bathroom, how long I sit on the toilet.” Then he made his final appeal. This election, he said, is a vote for either keeping him in jail or restoring his freedom. He will be watching the results on June 4 from his cell. “You can write me letters,” he said. “Cell No. 25, Jail No. 2, Tihar Jail.”",prime minister narendra modi entered india general election

nytimes,Strangers in Their Own Land: Being Muslim in Modi’s India,"May 18, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/18/world/asia/muslims-india.html,"It is a lonely feeling to know that your country’s leaders do not want you. To be vilified because you are a Muslim in what is now a largely Hindu-first India. It colors everything. Friends, dear for decades, change. Neighbors hold back from neighborly gestures — no longer joining in celebrations, or knocking to inquire in moments of pain. “It is a lifeless life,” said Ziya Us Salam, a writer who lives on the outskirts of Delhi with his wife, Uzma Ausaf, and their four daughters. When he was a film critic for one of India’s main newspapers, Mr. Salam, 53, filled his time with cinema, art, music. Workdays ended with riding on the back of an older friend’s motorcycle to a favorite food stall for long chats. His wife, a fellow journalist, wrote about life, food and fashion. Now, Mr. Salam’s routine is reduced to office and home, his thoughts occupied by heavier concerns. The constant ethnic profiling because he is “visibly Muslim” — by the bank teller, by the parking lot attendant, by fellow passengers on the train — is wearying, he said. Family conversations are darker, with both parents focused on raising their daughters in a country that increasingly questions or even tries to erase the markers of Muslims’ identity — how they dress, what they eat, even their Indianness altogether. One of the daughters, an impressive student-athlete, struggled so much that she needed counseling and missed months of school. The family often debates whether to stay in their mixed Hindu-Muslim neighborhood in Noida, just outside Delhi. Mariam, their oldest daughter, who is a graduate student, leans toward compromise, anything to make life bearable. She wants to move. Anywhere but a Muslim area might be difficult. Real estate agents often ask outright if families are Muslim; landlords are reluctant to rent to them. “I have started taking it in stride,” Mariam said. “I refuse to,” Mr. Salam shot back. He is old enough to remember when coexistence was largely the norm in an enormously diverse India, and he does not want to add to the country’s increasing segregation. But he is also pragmatic. He wishes Mariam would move abroad, at least while the country is like this. Mr. Salam clings to the hope that India is in a passing phase. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, is playing a long game. His rise to national power in 2014, on a promise of rapid development, swept a decades-old Hindu nationalist movement from the margins of Indian politics firmly to the center. He has since chipped away at the secular framework and robust democracy that had long held India together despite its sometimes explosive religious and caste divisions. Right-wing organizations began using the enormous power around Mr. Modi as a shield to try to reshape Indian society. Their members provoked sectarian clashes as the government looked away, with officials showing up later to raze Muslim homes and round up Muslim men. Emboldened vigilante groups lynched Muslims they accused of smuggling beef (cows are sacred to many Hindus). Top leaders in Mr. Modi’s party openly celebrated Hindus who committed crimes against Muslims. On large sections of broadcast media, but particularly on social media, bigotry coursed unchecked. WhatsApp groups spread conspiracy theories about Muslim men luring Hindu women for religious conversion, or even about Muslims spitting in restaurant food. While Mr. Modi and his party officials reject claims of discrimination by pointing to welfare programs that cover Indians equally, Mr. Modi himself is now repeating anti-Muslim tropes in the election that ends early next month. He has targeted India’s 200 million Muslims more directly than ever, calling them “infiltrators” and insinuating that they have too many children. This creeping Islamophobia is now the dominant theme of Mr. Salam’s writings. Cinema and music, life’s pleasures, feel smaller now. In one book, he chronicled the lynchings of Muslim men. In a recent follow-up, he described how India’s Muslims feel “orphaned” in their homeland. “If I don’t pick up issues of import, and limit my energies to cinema and literature, then I won’t be able to look at myself in the mirror,” he said. “What would I tell my kids tomorrow — when my grandchildren ask me what were you doing when there was an existential crisis?” As a child, Mr. Salam lived on a mixed street of Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims in Delhi. When the afternoon sun would grow hot, the children would move their games under the trees in the yard of a Hindu temple. The priest would come with water for all. “I was like any other kid for him,” Mr. Salam recalled. Those memories are one reason Mr. Salam maintains a stubborn optimism that India can restore its secular fabric. Another is that Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalism, while sweeping large parts of the country, has been resisted by several states in the country’s more prosperous south. Family conversations among Muslims there are very different: about college degrees, job promotions, life plans — the usual aspirations. In the state of Tamil Nadu, often-bickering political parties are united in protecting secularism and in focusing on economic well-being. Its chief minister, M.K. Stalin, is a declared atheist. Jan Mohammed, who lives with his family of five in Chennai, the state capital, said neighbors joined in each other’s religious celebrations. In rural areas, there is a tradition: When one community finishes building a place of worship, villagers of other faiths arrive with gifts of fruits, vegetables and flowers and stay for a meal. “More than accommodation, there is understanding,” Mr. Mohammed said. His family is full of overachievers — the norm in their educated state. Mr. Mohammed, with a master’s degree, is in the construction business. His wife, Rukhsana, who has an economics degree, started an online clothing business after the children grew up. One daughter, Maimoona Bushra, has two master’s degrees and now teaches at a local college as she prepares for her wedding. The youngest, Hafsa Lubna, has a master’s in commerce and within two years went from an intern at a local company to a manager of 20. Two of the daughters had planned to continue on to Ph.D’s. The only worry was that potential grooms would be intimidated. “The proposals go down,” Ms. Rukhsana joked. A thousand miles north, in Delhi, Mr. Salam’s family lives in what feels like another country. A place where prejudice has become so routine that even a friendship of 26 years can be sundered as a result. Mr. Salam had nicknamed a former editor “human mountain” for his large stature. When they rode on the editor’s motorcycle after work in the Delhi winter, he shielded Mr. Salam from the wind. They were together often; when his friend got his driver’s license, Mr. Salam was there with him. “I would go to my prayer every day, and he would go to the temple every day,” Mr. Salam said. “And I used to respect him for that.” A few years ago, things began to change. The WhatsApp messages came first. The editor started forwarding to Mr. Salam some staples of anti-Muslim misinformation: for example, that Muslims will rule India in 20 years because their women give birth every year and their men are allowed four wives. “Initially, I said, ‘Why do you want to get into all this?’ I thought he was just an old man who was getting all these and forwarding,” Mr. Salam said. “I give him the benefit of doubt.” The breaking point came two years ago, when Yogi Adityanath, a Modi protégé, was re-elected as the leader of Uttar Pradesh, the populous state adjoining Delhi where the Salam family lives. Mr. Adityanath, more overtly belligerent than Mr. Modi toward Muslims, governs in the saffron robe of a Hindu monk, frequently greeting large crowds of Hindu pilgrims with flowers, while cracking down on public displays of Muslim faith. On the day of the vote counting, the friend kept calling Mr. Salam, rejoicing at Mr. Adityanath’s lead. Just days earlier, the friend had been complaining about rising unemployment and his son’s struggle to find a job during Mr. Adityanath’s first term. “I said, ‘You have been so happy since morning, what do you gain?’” he recalled asking the friend. “Yogi ended namaz,” the friend responded, referring to Muslim prayer on Fridays that often spills into the streets. “That was the day I said goodbye,” Mr. Salam said, “and he hasn’t come back into my life after that.”",lonely feeling know country leader want vilified muslim largely hindufirst india color everything friend dear decade

nytimes,La diplomacia de Musk: cautivar a la derecha mundial para beneficiarse,"May 16, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/05/16/espanol/elon-musk-lideres-mundiales-tesla-beneficios.html,"Unos minutos después de que se hizo evidente que Javier Milei había sido elegido presidente del segundo país más grande de América del Sur, en noviembre, Elon Musk publicó en la red social X (antes conocida como Twitter): “La prosperidad está por venir en Argentina”. Desde entonces, Musk ha seguido usando X, la red social de la que es dueño, para alentar a Milei. El multimillonario ha compartido videos en los que el presidente argentino ataca la “justicia social” con sus 182 millones de seguidores. Musk ha ayudado a convertir al belicoso libertario en uno de los nuevos rostros de la derecha moderna. Pero fuera de línea, ha aprovechado esta relación para ejercer presión y obtener beneficios para sus otras empresas, la fabricante de automóviles eléctricos Tesla y la constructora de cohetes espaciales SpaceX. “Me llamó Elon Musk”, afirmó Milei en una entrevista por televisión unas semanas después de asumir el cargo. “Está sumamente interesado en el litio”. Musk ha declarado que el litio —el elemento blanco-plateado que es el principal componente de las baterías de los autos de Tesla— es “el nuevo petróleo”. Tesla lleva mucho tiempo comprándole litio a Argentina, que es el segundo país con mayores reservas. Ahora, Milei presiona para que las mineras internacionales de litio reciban beneficios importantes, lo que probablemente le daría a Tesla un flujo más estable —y quizá más barato— de uno de los recursos más vitales para la empresa. Milei se ajusta a un patrón que sigue Musk de fomentar relaciones con una constelación de jefes de Estado de derecha, con beneficiarios muy claros: él mismo y sus empresas. Musk, de 52 años, ha utilizado en repetidas ocasiones una pieza de su imperio empresarial —la red social X— para expresar su apoyo a políticos como Milei, Jair Bolsonaro de Brasil y Narendra Modi de India. En la plataforma, Musk ha respaldado sus posturas en temas de género, ha celebrado su oposición al socialismo y ha confrontado con agresión a sus enemigos. Musk incluso cambió personalmente las políticas de contenido de la plataforma X de una forma que pareció beneficiar a Bolsonaro, según dijeron dos exempleados de la plataforma. Musk, a su vez, ha presionado y obtenido ventajas corporativas para sus empresas más lucrativas, Tesla y SpaceX, según un análisis de The New York Times. En India, logró que se le cobraran aranceles menores por la importación de los vehículos de Tesla. En Brasil, abrió un importante mercado nuevo para Starlink, el servicio de internet por satélite de SpaceX. En Argentina, aseguró el acceso al mineral más crucial para las baterías de Tesla. El respaldo de Musk les ha dado a muchos jefes de Estado nacionalistas y de derecha más prestigio internacional, el cual no han dudado en promocionar como una validación de sus políticas y popularidad. Musk, Tesla, SpaceX y la plataforma X no respondieron a nuestras solicitudes de comentarios. En septiembre de 2015, Musk recibió a Modi en la fábrica de Tesla en Fremont, California. Modi, político nacionalista indio, había sido electo primer ministro de India un año antes, cuando su partido, Bharatiya Janata, arrasó para llegar al poder, y visitaba Estados Unidos para reunirse con líderes empresariales. Musk y Modi posaron para las fotos cerca de un flamante automóvil rojo Model S. Comentaron que los “paneles solares y las baterías” podrían brindar electricidad a regiones rurales de India sin necesidad de líneas eléctricas, señaló Musk en ese entonces. “Comprendí su visión”, dijo más tarde Modi. Fue una de las primeras instancias en que Musk sostuvo una reunión en público con un líder nacionalista. Además, fue el principio de un plan a largo plazo con Modi, relación que tardó años en desarrollar y comenzó a redituarle a Musk después de que compró Twitter.. India podría ser un mercado masivo para Tesla, que necesita incursionar en regiones nuevas para crecer. Pero ese país prácticamente prohibió los vehículos eléctricos construidos por fabricantes extranjeros. En años recientes, los aranceles impuestos en India a los vehículos eléctricos importados han aumentado hasta un 100 por ciento. Musk recurrió en un principio a la diplomacia personal tradicional: se reunió con Modi y les ordenó a los empleados de Tesla estrechar relaciones con algunos funcionarios. Después de que Musk compró Twitter en 2022, aprovechó su nueva palanca. La plataforma, renombrada como X, se utiliza ampliamente en India —hasta Modi lo hace y tiene casi 98 millones de seguidores— y es un foro importante de debate político. Musk se reunió en persona con Modi de nuevo en junio pasado, cuando el primer ministro visitó Nueva York. Se identificó como “fan de Modi” y afirmó que Modi estaba “alentándonos a hacer inversiones significativas en India, algo que planeamos hacer”. Para entonces, los empleados de Tesla de nuevo sostenían conversaciones con los asesores de Modi sobre una reducción de los aranceles y una inversión en India, según indicaron dos personas familiarizadas con las conversaciones. Rohan Patel, quien era vicepresidente de política pública y desarrollo comercial de Tesla, viajó a India en varias ocasiones. Por su parte, Piyush Goyal, ministro de Comercio de India, visitó la fábrica de Fremont en noviembre. En enero, Musk publicó en X que India debería recibir un lugar permanente en el Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas, lo que reforzaría la posición internacional de India. “Que India no tenga un lugar permanente en el Consejo de Seguridad, a pesar de ser el país más poblado del planeta, es absurdo”, escribió Musk. Todo parece indicar que Modi se percató del comentario. Dos meses después, India anunció que había decidido reducir algunos aranceles de importación para los fabricantes de automóviles eléctricos que se comprometieran a asignar por lo menos 500 millones de dólares a la producción de vehículos en el país. La política redujo los aranceles del 100 al 15 por ciento del precio de cada automóvil, específicamente para los vehículos eléctricos con un precio superior a 35.000 dólares. La descripción se ajusta a Tesla a la perfección. Sus automóviles Model 3 tienen un precio de 38.990 dólares. Para 2021, Musk ya aplicaba una táctica similar para introducir el servicio de internet de su red de satélites Starlink en Brasil, gobernado en ese entonces por Bolsonaro, presidente populista de derecha elegido tres años antes. En esa época, Starlink estaba en pañales, con menos de 150.000 usuarios en 25 países. En octubre de 2021, Fábio Faria, ministro de Comunicaciones de Brasil y uno de los organizadores de la campaña de reelección de Bolsonaro, le envió una carta a Musk en la que le decía que “Starlink y Brasil pueden ser excelentes aliados”, según consta en correspondencia obtenida por las leyes de transparencia de información del país. Semanas más tarde, Faria visitó a Musk en Texas. Tras su regreso a Brasil, Faria presionó a los reguladores para que aprobaran a Starlink. En cierto momento, instó a la agencia espacial de Brasil a mantenerse al margen de cualquier debate sobre los satélites de SpaceX en el país, según testificó más adelante ante el Congreso Nacional de Brasil. Los reguladores de Brasil aprobaron la operación de Starlink en diciembre de 2021, siete meses después de presentada la primera solicitud del servicio. Fue la más rápida de las cinco aprobaciones que los reguladores les otorgaron a prestadores de servicios de internet por satélite. Musk ayudó más tarde a Bolsonaro, cuando enfrentó una difícil batalla en su campaña de 2022 por la reelección. El 20 de mayo de ese año, Musk hizo un viaje sorpresa a Brasil para hacer un anuncio importante con el presidente. Starlink iba a llegar al país y planeaba ofrecerles acceso a internet a 19.000 escuelas rurales, además del monitoreo ambiental de la Amazonía, según indicaron durante un evento en un complejo hotelero cerca de São Paulo. Bolsonaro le entregó a Musk una medalla y lo llamó una “verdadera leyenda de nuestra libertad” por su oferta de ese año para comprar Twitter.. Pero solo había un inconveniente: el plan de ofrecerles conexión a las escuelas nunca se concretó, explicó Carlos Baigorri, principal regulador de telecomunicaciones de Brasil, quien ayudó a aprobar el ingreso de Starlink en el país. “En realidad no creo que siquiera haya existido”, comentó acerca del plan. Musk y Bolsonaro se beneficiaron de cualquier manera. Musk había atrincherado a SpaceX en un mercado vital, en el que Starlink tiene ahora 150.000 cuentas activas, según la reguladora de telecomunicaciones de Brasil. La campaña de Bolsonaro logró promover la agudeza comercial del presidente y presentarlo como defensor de la Amazonía antes de las elecciones. El favor de Musk no evitó que Bolsonaro perdiera la presidencia ante Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, expresidente de izquierda de Brasil, en octubre de 2022. Pero en unas semanas, Musk, que acababa de concretar su acuerdo para comprar Twitter, intentó de nuevo ayudar a Bolsonaro. Los partidarios de Bolsonaro habían comenzado a impulsar acusaciones en Twitter de que algunos jueces brasileños habían inclinado la balanza en las elecciones cuando les ordenaron a las redes sociales eliminar publicaciones y cuentas con ideología de derecha. Mientras estaban instalados frente a bases militares para exigir la anulación de las elecciones, Musk alimentó sus sospechas dando a entender que los antiguos jefes de Twitter habían contribuido a la derrota de Bolsonaro. “Es posible que algunos empleados de Twitter les hayan dado preferencia a los candidatos de izquierda”, publicó en diciembre de 2022, sin mencionar ninguna evidencia. Más tarde, escribió que la empresa “quizá tenga personas en el equipo de Brasil con un fuerte sesgo político”. En 2022, uno de los proveedores de litio de Tesla anunció una inversión de 1100 millones de dólares para ampliar sus operaciones en Argentina. Desde entonces, Musk ha mostrado gran interés en la política argentina ―particularmente en Milei―, lo que ha generado uno de los bromances o “romance entre hermanos” más evidentes entre las relaciones políticas de Musk. Milei, economista libertario y comentarista de televisión, promovió durante su campaña la idea de sacar al gobierno de la economía y establecer una relación más estrecha entre Argentina y Estados Unidos. Al igual que Musk, insulta con frecuencia a sus críticos, tiene un hábito intenso con las redes sociales y está muy preocupado por la amenaza de la cultura progre. Unos días antes de la toma de posesión de Milei en diciembre, hablaron directamente por primera vez y Musk le preguntó sobre el litio de Argentina. En los meses posteriores, Milei ha impulsado legislación que haría mucho más atractiva la extracción de litio en Argentina para los inversionistas extranjeros. Su proyecto legislativo de gran envergadura, que le otorgaría, durante el año próximo, amplias facultades en situación de emergencia sobre la economía y la energía de Argentina, incluye un gran beneficio para Tesla: incentivos significativos para inversionistas extranjeros con proyectos grandes, en especial en la industria minera. Esas empresas recibirían recortes fiscales sustanciales, exenciones de impuestos aduaneros y beneficios de cambio de divisas, así como certidumbre fiscal y regulatoria por un periodo de 30 años. Es probable que califique el proveedor de litio de Tesla. En tal caso, el plan de Milei le daría a Tesla una estabilidad y predictibilidad inusuales en cuanto a su acceso a litio en Argentina por lo menos hasta 2054. La propuesta fue aprobada en la cámara baja del Congreso de Argentina el 30 de abril. Musk ya ha visto otros dividendos de Milei. En uno de sus primeros actos como presidente, Milei aprobó una orden ejecutiva con 366 disposiciones. Cuando sintetizó los puntos clave de la orden en un discurso por televisión, Milei mencionó solo una marca corporativa específica: Starlink. SpaceX había intentado lograr la aprobación de Starlink en Argentina desde 2022, pero estaba en un atolladero burocrático. Milei no tardó en reducir las regulaciones aplicables al internet por satélite, lo que le permitió a Starlink arrancar operaciones en el país en marzo.",unos minutos despus de que se hizo evidente que

nytimes,The Scrappy World War II Pilots Who Took Flight for a Perilous Mission,"May 14, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/books/review/skies-of-thunder-caroline-alexander.html,"“You and your outfit have been assigned one of the most important military missions ever given to American soldiers — the task of driving the Japanese back to Tokyo.” So begins “A Pocket Guide to India,” prepared for World War II service members in the western base section of the China-Burma-India Theater, commonly known as the C.B.I. “India is a strange, colorful land,” the guide continues. “If you exercise a normal amount of curiosity you’ll learn much that is fascinating; much that will enable you to begin stories to your children or grandchildren in later years, ‘Now, when I was in India. …’” If the guide seems to protest too much, perhaps that’s because the C.B.I. was, as Caroline Alexander explains in her riveting new book, “Skies of Thunder,” under-resourced, improvisational and rife with smugglers, its actual purpose murkier than its symbolic value. It was the war’s “most chaotic theater,” she writes, marked by “competing interests, and contradictions that exposed the fault lines between the Allies.” To some stationed there, C.B.I. stood for “Confusion Beyond Imagination.” My father, who served as an air traffic controller in the C.B.I., didn’t recall reading the “Pocket Guide,” but he did tell me stories of working in Delhi and Agra, a vital supply depot and service point, and traveling to various locations to lay radio-range beacons. The main point of these activities, he explained, was to enable pilots to fly supplies over the Himalayas to China. While it was always easy for me to picture my father in his control tower, those flights over the mountains remained mysterious until I read Alexander’s vivid account. Alexander, the author of books on Shackleton’s Endurance expedition and the fateful voyage of the Bounty, begins with the Allied loss of Burma to the Japanese in April 1942, which sealed off the ground supply corridor from India to China and led to the opening of an “aerial Burma Road.” This treacherous route, known as “the Hump,” supplied Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist government and Allied troops, including the 14th Air Force, commanded by the flamboyant Claire Chennault. Alexander casts her story as an “epic,” yet it is one in which the actors suffer like Job more often than they fight like Achilles. There are stirring episodes of British sang-froid, “American-style glamour” and remarkable courage among the region’s remote tribal peoples, but it is perseverance that assumes heroic proportions: refugees escaping through the Burmese jungle; soldiers and local laborers hacking through that same jungle to build a new road; Assam airfield personnel living in squalor, seared by the sun, swamped by monsoons, but most of all shrouded in a “miasma of cynical indifference.” What unites this book with the author’s previous work is a fascination with human behavior in extremis. While Alexander devotes considerable space to strategic and political issues, her interest lies primarily in the vicissitudes of individual human personality. In places she represents the theater’s dysfunction as a tragicomedy of failed relationships at the highest levels of command: between the mercurial Chiang Kai-shek and the American Joseph Stilwell, the theater’s irascible, insecure commanding general; between Stilwell and the unscrupulous, self-aggrandizing Chennault; between Stilwell and the British allies he loathed. Alexander’s gift for dramatizing these personal animosities occasionally produces seductive yet oversimplified biographical explanations of historical problems, a mode E.H. Carr described as “the Bad King John theory of history.” Ultimately, and rightly, the pilots — intrepid as “sailors of old” crossing “unknown oceans” — are the core of the book. Demeaned as “Hump drivers,” ostensible noncombatants at the bottom of the aviation hierarchy, they flew an inadequately charted route over baffling terrain, its surreality intensified by their frequent refusal to wear oxygen masks. Alexander adroitly explicates technical concepts — flight mechanics, de-icing, night vision — but is at her best rendering pilots’ fear. Besides terrain, its sources included weather, enemy aircraft, insufficient training, night missions and “short rations of fuel” on the return leg. At least a pilot could depend on his plane, the beloved Douglas C-47 Skytrain, until the introduction of unreliable or unsound higher-capacity models turned the machines themselves into another source of terror. Readers thrilled by sagas of flight will marvel at the logistics required to transport a stunning 650,000 tons of cargo by air, the audacity required to fly the Hump, the search-and-rescue operations necessitated by its hazards and the experimental use of aviation involved in the Allied recapture of Burma in 1944. They will also have to reckon with Alexander’s hard-nosed conclusions about the C.B.I. Others who have chronicled its history concentrated on the strategic merits of this deeply imperfect theater, or celebrated its pioneering use of air power. The image that dominates the end of Alexander’s epic is “the aluminum trail” of wreckage — “the hundreds of crashed aircraft that still lie undiscovered in the jungles, valleys and fractured ranges beneath the Hump’s old route.”",outfit assigned one important military mission ever given american soldier task driving japanese back tokyo begin pocket guide india prepared world war ii service member western base section chinaburmaindia theater commonly known cbi india strange colorful land guide continues exercise normal amount curiosity youll learn much fascinating much enable begin story child grandchild later year india guide seems protest much perhaps thats cbi caroline alexander explains riveting new book sky thunder underresourced improvisational rife smuggler actual purpose murkier symbolic value war chaotic theater writes marked competing interest contradiction exposed fault line ally stationed cbi stood confusion beyond imagination father served air traffic controller cbi didnt recall reading pocket guide tell story working delhi agra vital supply depot service point traveling various location lay radiorange beacon main point activity explained enable pilot fly supply himalaya china always easy picture father control tower flight mountain remained mysterious read alexander vivid account alexander author book shackletons endurance expedition fateful voyage bounty begin allied loss burma japanese april sealed ground supply corridor india china led opening aerial burma road treacherous route known hump supplied chiang kaisheks nationalist government allied troop including th air force commanded flamboyant claire chennault alexander cast story epic yet one actor suffer like job often fight like achilles stirring episode british sangfroid americanstyle glamour remarkable courage among region remote tribal people perseverance assumes heroic proportion refugee escaping burmese jungle soldier local laborer hacking jungle build new road assam airfield personnel living squalor seared sun swamped monsoon shrouded miasma cynical indifference unites book author previous work fascination human behavior extremis alexander devotes considerable space strategic political issue interest lie primarily vicissitude individual human personality place represents theater dysfunction tragicomedy failed relationship highest level command mercurial chiang kaishek american joseph stilwell theater irascible insecure commanding general stilwell unscrupulous selfaggrandizing chennault stilwell british ally loathed alexander gift dramatizing personal animosity occasionally produce seductive yet oversimplified biographical explanation historical problem mode eh carr described bad king john theory history ultimately rightly pilot intrepid sailor old crossing unknown ocean core book demeaned hump driver ostensible noncombatant bottom aviation hierarchy flew inadequately charted route baffling terrain surreality intensified frequent refusal wear oxygen mask alexander adroitly explicates technical concept flight mechanic deicing night vision best rendering pilot fear besides terrain source included weather enemy aircraft insufficient training night mission short ration fuel return leg least pilot could depend plane beloved douglas c skytrain introduction unreliable unsound highercapacity model turned machine another source terror reader thrilled saga flight marvel logistics required transport stunning ton cargo air audacity required fly hump searchandrescue operation necessitated hazard experimental use aviation involved allied recapture burma also reckon alexander hardnosed conclusion cbi others chronicled history concentrated strategic merit deeply imperfect theater celebrated pioneering use air power image dominates end alexander epic aluminum trail wreckage hundred crashed aircraft still lie undiscovered jungle valley fractured range beneath hump old route
nytimes,14 Killed as Storm Topples Huge Billboard in India,"May 13, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/world/asia/mumbai-india-storm-deaths.html,"Fourteen people were killed in a suburb of Mumbai, India’s financial capital, on Monday as strong winds from a storm caused the collapse of a huge billboard that officials said had been erected without permission. At least 64 people were injured in the collapse, and rescue workers were searching for more survivors trapped under the debris on Tuesday morning. Videos on social media showed the billboard shaking in the storm before falling on a gas station. An eyewitness, Sunil Gaikwad, said he and his wife had taken shelter with dozens of others in the gas station, on a busy road in the Ghatkopar area, when the rain and wind worsened. Within minutes, he said, the billboard toppled onto the gas station and a parking area. “All of us were stuck for hours before people came and saved us,” Mr. Gaikwad said from a Mumbai hospital, where he was being treated for minor injuries. “It was like a huge building falling on top of us.” Mumbai, home to more than 18 million people, is prone to severe flooding and rain-related accidents during the monsoon season, which runs roughly from June to September. Last year, a landslide triggered by torrential rains killed at least 16 people in Maharashtra, the state that includes Mumbai. Across India, more than 2,000 people were killed last year because of floods and rain-related incidents during the monsoon season, according to data from India’s federal home ministry. Eknath Shinde, the chief minister of Maharashtra, ordered officials to check all billboard structures in Mumbai. His deputy, Devendra Fadnavis, said the government had opened an investigation into the collapse. The rains on Monday were followed by dust storms. The authorities at the Mumbai airport said they had diverted more than a dozen inbound flights and suspended operations for more than an hour. Though the rains brought some relief from the sweltering heat, many parts of the city were inundated, and there were large traffic jams.",fourteen people killed suburb mumbai india financial capital monday strong wind storm caused collapse huge billboard official said erected without permission least people injured collapse rescue worker searching survivor trapped debris tuesday morning video social medium showed billboard shaking storm falling gas station eyewitness sunil gaikwad said wife taken shelter dozen others gas station busy road ghatkopar area rain wind worsened within minute said billboard toppled onto gas station parking area u stuck hour people came saved u mr gaikwad said mumbai hospital treated minor injury like huge building falling top u mumbai home million people prone severe flooding rainrelated accident monsoon season run roughly june september last year landslide triggered torrential rain killed least people maharashtra state includes mumbai across india people killed last year flood rainrelated incident monsoon season according data india federal home ministry eknath shinde chief minister maharashtra ordered official check billboard structure mumbai deputy devendra fadnavis said government opened investigation collapse rain monday followed dust storm authority mumbai airport said diverted dozen inbound flight suspended operation hour though rain brought relief sweltering heat many part city inundated large traffic jam
nytimes,Elon Musk’s Diplomacy: Woo Right-Wing World Leaders. Then Benefit.,"May 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/technology/elon-musk-world-leaders.html,"Minutes after it became clear that Javier Milei had been elected president of South America’s second-largest nation in November, Elon Musk posted on X: “Prosperity is ahead for Argentina.” Since then, Mr. Musk has continued to use X, the social network he owns, to boost Mr. Milei. The billionaire has shared videos of the Argentine president attacking “social justice” with his 182 million followers. One doctored image, which implied that watching a speech by Mr. Milei was better than having sex, is among Mr. Musk’s most viewed posts ever. Mr. Musk has helped turn the pugnacious libertarian into one of the new faces of the modern right. But offline, he has used the relationship to press for benefits to his other businesses, the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX. “Elon Musk called me,” Mr. Milei said in a television interview weeks after taking office. “He is extremely interested in the lithium.” Mr. Musk has declared lithium — the silvery-white element that is the main component in Tesla’s car batteries — “the new oil.” Tesla has long bought lithium from Argentina, which has the world’s second-largest reserves. Now Mr. Milei is pushing for major benefits for international lithium miners, which would likely give Tesla a more stable — and potentially cheaper — flow of one of its most critical resources. Mr. Milei is part of a pattern by Mr. Musk of fostering relationships with a constellation of right-wing heads of state, with clear beneficiaries: his companies and himself. Mr. Musk, 52, has repeatedly used one piece of his business empire — X, formerly known as Twitter — to vocally support politicians like Mr. Milei, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Narendra Modi of India. On the platform, Mr. Musk has backed their views on gender, feted their opposition to socialism and aggressively confronted their enemies. Mr. Musk even personally intervened in X’s content policies in ways that appeared to aid Mr. Bolsonaro, two former X employees said. Mr. Musk, in turn, has pushed for and won corporate advantages for his most lucrative businesses, Tesla and SpaceX, according to an examination by The New York Times. In India, he secured lower import tariffs for Tesla’s vehicles. In Brazil, he opened a major new market for Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite internet service. In Argentina, he solidified access to the mineral most crucial to Tesla’s batteries. Mr. Musk’s endorsement has given many nationalist and right-wing heads of state more international cachet, which they have eagerly promoted as a validation of their policies and popularity. Last month, as India began holding an election, Mr. Modi prepared to host Mr. Musk in New Delhi, calling the billionaire’s visit a testament to his leadership. “People are coming, and they are trusting me,” the Indian prime minister said in a televised interview before Mr. Musk postponed his trip. Mr. Musk, Tesla, SpaceX and X did not respond to requests for comment. No other American megabillionaire businessperson has so publicly fostered ideological relationships with world leaders to advance personal politics and businesses. Bill Gates, Microsoft’s co-founder turned philanthropist, engaged in political diplomacy largely after stepping back from corporate life. Other chief executives typically stay quiet about meetings with politicians. Mr. Musk’s politics have long been guided by his businesses, said five former Tesla and SpaceX executives who worked closely with him and were not authorized to speak publicly. In the 2010s, he built an alliance with President Barack Obama as Tesla and SpaceX welcomed federal assistance and contracts. He remains close to some mainstream leaders, notably President Emmanuel Macron of France. But as populism and nationalism spread, Mr. Musk courted Xi Jinping in China and supported Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni. He began criticizing the “woke mind virus” and what he has declared the failings of the left, which he says have led to issues such as illegal immigration and declining birthrates. “I guess if you consider fighting the woke mind virus, which I consider to be a civilizational threat, to be political, then yes,” Mr. Musk said in a podcast in November when asked if he was becoming more political. “Woke mind virus is communism rebranded.” In September 2015, Mr. Musk welcomed Mr. Modi to Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif. Mr. Modi, a Hindu nationalist politician, had been elected India’s prime minister a year earlier when his Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power, and was visiting the United States to meet business leaders. Standing under Indian and U.S. flags at the factory, Mr. Musk and Mr. Modi posed for photographs near a gleaming red Model S car. They discussed how “solar panels and battery packs” could power rural regions in India without electrical lines, Mr. Musk said at the time. “I understood his vision,” Mr. Modi later said. It was one of the first instances of Mr. Musk’s publicly meeting a nationalist leader. And it was the beginning of a long game between him and Mr. Modi, a relationship that took years to develop — and that started paying off for Mr. Musk after he bought X. India is a potentially massive market for Tesla, which needs to expand to new regions to grow. But the country has virtually barred electric vehicles built by foreign manufacturers. In recent years, the tariff India imposes on imported electric vehicles has risen as high as 100 percent. Mr. Musk initially used traditional personal diplomacy, meeting with Mr. Modi and ordering his staff at Tesla to get close to officials. In 2017, Tesla sent a letter to India’s government to kick-start talks on operating in the country. Another overture to Mr. Modi’s government in 2019 was rebuffed, three people with knowledge of the company said. After Mr. Musk bought Twitter in 2022, he had a new lever. The platform, renamed X, is widely used in India — including by Mr. Modi, who has nearly 98 million followers — and is a major forum of political discussion. Before Mr. Musk owned the platform, Twitter tangled with Mr. Modi’s government. The company, which complies with requests to block certain content in India, had sued the government and challenged its power to censor online material. Under Mr. Musk, X blocked posts last year that linked to a BBC documentary examining Mr. Modi’s role in the 2002 Hindu-Muslim riots in Gujarat, where he was the chief minister at the time. Twitter’s lawsuit against the Indian government was dismissed in July. In a discussion last year with Twitter employees, Mr. Musk intimated that he was personally close with Mr. Modi. He said he could easily call the prime minister to take care of a content issue, two former employees said. It’s unclear if any conversation took place. Mr. Musk met Mr. Modi in person again last June when the prime minister visited New York. He called himself a “fan of Modi” and said Mr. Modi was “pushing us to make significant investment in India, which is something that we intend to do.” By then, Tesla employees were again talking with Mr. Modi’s advisers about a reduction in tariffs and investing in India, two people familiar with the conversations said. Rohan Patel, who was Tesla’s vice president of public policy and business development, traveled to India several times, and Piyush Goyal, India’s commerce minister, visited the Fremont factory in November. In January, Mr. Musk posted on X that India should receive a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, which would boost India’s international standing. “India not having a permanent seat on the Security Council, despite being the most populous country on Earth, is absurd,” he wrote. The timing suggests that Mr. Modi noticed. Two months later, India announced it was reducing some import duties for electric carmakers that committed at least $500 million to produce vehicles in the country. The policy dropped tariffs to 15 percent of a car’s price from 100 percent, specifically for electric vehicles that retail for more than $35,000. The description fit Tesla to a T. Its Model 3 cars ship at $38,990. BYD, the fast-growing Chinese electric vehicle maker, is barred from investing in India on national security grounds. Last month, Tesla scouted potential factory sites in three Indian states, three people familiar with the process said. Mr. Musk had also said he would visit Mr. Modi in New Delhi during the country’s multiweek general election, before delaying the trip, citing obligations with Tesla. Mr. Musk promised not to stay away for long. “I do very much look forward to visiting later this year,” he wrote on X. By 2021, Mr. Musk was employing a similar courtship to bring his Starlink satellite internet service to Brazil, which was then led by Mr. Bolsonaro, the right-wing populist president elected three years earlier. At the time, Starlink was in its infancy, with fewer than 150,000 users across 25 countries. In October 2021, Fábio Faria, Brazil’s communications minister and an organizer of Mr. Bolsonaro’s re-election campaign, sent a letter to Mr. Musk, saying that “Starlink and Brazil can become great partners,” according to correspondence obtained through the country’s open records laws. Weeks later, Mr. Faria visited Mr. Musk in Texas. After returning to Brazil, Mr. Faria pushed regulators to approve Starlink, at one point urging Brazil’s space agency to stay out of any debate about SpaceX’s satellites over the country, he later testified to Brazil's Congress. Brazil’s regulators approved Starlink for operation in December 2021, seven months after the service first applied. It was the fastest of five approvals that regulators granted to satellite internet providers. Mr. Musk later lent a hand to Mr. Bolsonaro, who faced an uphill battle in his 2022 re-election campaign. On May 20 that year, Mr. Musk made a surprise trip to Brazil for a major announcement alongside the president. Starlink was coming to the country, and it would provide internet connectivity to 19,000 rural schools, as well as environmental monitoring of the Amazon, they said at an event in a resort near São Paulo. Mr. Bolsonaro gave Mr. Musk a medal and called him a “true legend of freedom” for his bid that year to buy Twitter. There was just one catch: The plan to connect schools never materialized, said Carlos Baigorri, Brazil’s chief telecommunications regulator, who helped approve Starlink’s entry into the country. “I don’t really think that it even existed,” he said of the plan. Brazilian officials said they had no record of Starlink’s connecting Brazilian schools for free or conducting environmental monitoring. Mr. Musk and Mr. Bolsonaro benefited anyway. Mr. Musk had entrenched SpaceX in a critical market, where Starlink now has 150,000 active accounts, according to Brazil’s telecommunications regulator. Mr. Bolsonaro’s campaign got to promote the president’s business acumen and cast him as a defender of the Amazon before an election. Mr. Musk’s favor did not prevent Mr. Bolsonaro from losing the presidency to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s leftist former president, in October 2022. But within weeks, Mr. Musk, who had just completed his deal for Twitter, tried helping Mr. Bolsonaro again. Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters had started pushing accusations on Twitter that Brazilian judges had tilted the election by ordering social networks to remove right-wing posts and accounts. As they camped outside military bases demanding the election be overturned, Mr. Musk fed their suspicions by suggesting that Twitter’s former bosses had contributed to Mr. Bolsonaro’s defeat. “It’s possible that Twitter personnel gave preference to left wing candidates,” he posted in December 2022, without citing any evidence. He later wrote that the company “may have people on the Brazil team that are strongly politically biased.” Mr. Musk got involved in deciding which posts about Brazil’s election results should stay up or be taken down, two former Twitter employees said. Even after Mr. Musk was briefed about the risk of violence in Brazil that winter, he ordered employees to stop enforcing Twitter’s election rules in the country, including a policy forbidding users to spread misleading claims about election results, they said. He told them to remove only posts that directly incited violence or were subject to a court order. In January 2023, thousands of Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters stormed Brazil’s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices, under the false belief that the election had been stolen. Mr. Musk has since used X to attack one of Mr. Bolsonaro’s main political opponents, Alexandre de Moraes, a Brazilian Supreme Court justice who has overseen investigations into the former president and his supporters. X has blocked more than 100 accounts on orders from Justice Moraes, who has said many of them threatened Brazil’s democracy. “This judge has brazenly and repeatedly betrayed the constitution and people of Brazil,” Mr. Musk posted on X in April. “He should resign or be impeached.” At a rally called by Mr. Bolsonaro in Rio de Janeiro last month, his supporters held signs thanking Mr. Musk. When Mr. Bolsonaro addressed the crowd, he hailed the billionaire as “the man who really preserves true freedom for us all.” In 2022, one of Tesla’s lithium suppliers announced a $1.1 billion investment to expand in Argentina. Since then, Mr. Musk has taken a keen interest in Argentine politics — and particularly Mr. Milei — leading to one of the most pronounced bromances among Mr. Musk’s political relationships. Mr. Milei “would be quite a change,” Mr. Musk wrote on X in September in response to a post from the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who had called the then-candidate “Argentina’s next president.” Mr. Milei, a libertarian economist and TV pundit, campaigned on getting the government out of the economy and tying Argentina more closely to the United States. Like Mr. Musk, he frequently insults critics, has an intense social media habit and is deeply worried about the threat from “woke” culture. Days before Mr. Milei’s inauguration in December, they spoke directly for the first time, and Mr. Musk asked about Argentina’s lithium. In the months since, Mr. Milei has been pushing legislation that would make extracting Argentina’s lithium far more attractive to foreign investors. His sweeping bill, which would grant him broad emergency powers over Argentina’s economy and energy for the next year, includes a major benefit for Tesla: significant incentives for foreign investors in large projects, particularly in mining. Such companies would receive substantial tax cuts, customs exemptions and foreign-exchange benefits, as well as tax and regulatory certainty for the next 30 years. Tesla’s lithium supplier is likely to qualify. If so, Mr. Milei’s plan would give Tesla unusual stability and predictability in its access to lithium in Argentina until at least 2054. The proposal passed Argentina’s lower chamber of Congress on April 30. Mr. Musk has already seen other dividends from Mr. Milei. In one of his first acts as president, Mr. Milei passed an executive order with 366 provisions. When summarizing the highlights of the order in a televised address, Mr. Milei mentioned just one corporate brand by name: Starlink. SpaceX had pushed for Starlink’s approval in Argentina since 2022, but faced a bureaucratic jam. Mr. Milei quickly cut regulations on satellite internet, and Starlink began operating in the country in March. Mr. Milei, in turn, has benefited: Mr. Musk has become his most influential online promoter. In January, Mr. Musk shared videos of Mr. Milei’s speech at the World Economic Forum, in which the leader claimed communism and social justice were the main threats to the West. The posts set off a frenzy of praise for the Argentine across right-wing corners of the internet, including from Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who met with Mr. Milei in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington. Mr. Milei hugged Mr. Trump and told him he was rooting for him. Last month, Mr. Milei traveled to Austin, Texas, to visit Mr. Musk at Tesla’s factory there. The two men agreed to “open markets and defend the ideas of freedom,” according to a statement from Mr. Milei’s office. The statement did not mention lithium. Later, Gerardo Werthein, Argentina’s ambassador to the United States, told the Argentine newspaper La Nación that the pair had indeed discussed Argentina’s mineral reserves. Mr. Musk “had a very good view of everything we have,” Mr. Werthein said, “especially lithium.” On Monday, Mr. Musk and Mr. Milei met again, this time at a conference in Los Angeles. Mr. Milei called the entrepreneur “my friend” in a speech in which he praised Mr. Musk’s effort to reach Mars. A few hours later, Mr. Musk posted a photo of the two men with their thumbs up. “I recommend investing in Argentina,” he wrote.",minute became clear javier milei elected president south america

nytimes,"At Cannes, Indian Filmmakers Show There Is More Than Just Bollywood","May 11, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/11/movies/cannes-film-festival-india.html,"For the first time in 30 years at the Cannes Film Festival, an Indian film will compete for the Palme d’Or in the main competition, alongside new movies from Francis Ford Coppola, Yorgos Lanthimos and Andrea Arnold. The dry spell might come as a surprise for a country with film industries in multiple regions producing hundreds of films per year, including international sensations like last year’s Oscar-nominated “RRR.” But the inclusion of “All We Imagine as Light,” directed by Payal Kapadia, reflects a growing recognition of the independent cinema made in the shadow of the country’s mainstream hits. Thierry Frémaux, the artistic director of Cannes, noted the new generations of filmmakers in India when he announced the lineup in April. These movies offer what the critic Namrata Joshi calls “a young, probing, and provoking gaze at Indian reality.” Indian publications have celebrated the country’s prominent presence at the festival, whose inaugural edition in 1946 included a film from India, Chetan Anand’s “Neecha Nagar,” in its grand prize category. “All We Imagine as Light” joins a generally notable selection of Indian stories and storytellers across this year’s edition, which begins on Tuesday. Santosh Sivan will be the first Indian filmmaker to receive the Pierre Angénieux prize for career achievement in cinematography, and in the Un Certain Regard competition, Sandhya Suri’s “Santosh” follows a widow who takes on her husband’s policeman post. In Directors’ Fortnight, a parallel program during Cannes, Karan Kandhari’s “Sister Midnight” portrays a defiant newly married woman who seeks vengeance. And in ACID (Association for the Distribution of Independent Cinema) — a parallel program at Cannes devoted to independent film — an Indian feature will screen for the first time, “In Retreat,” directed by Maisam Ali. “It’s great because quite often we don’t have so many films from India represented in this way at Cannes,” Kapadia said in an interview from Paris where she was putting finishing touches on her film. Centering on two roommates, “All We Imagine as Light” is, Kapadia says, “about women who’ve come to Mumbai to work.” She returns to Cannes after winning best documentary in 2021 for her university-set reflection on love and protest, “A Night of Knowing Nothing.” But independent Indian productions can face a long road to screens at home because of domestic funding challenges and markets more accustomed to mainstream fare. “If you want to do something that’s a little experimental, it becomes challenging to find funding,” Kapadia said. “There are a few funds, but it’s a really big country and there are a lot of people.” Despite the obstacles, Indian films of modest budgets and artistic ambition have won awards abroad recently in major festivals like Sundance, “All That Breathes” in 2022; Rotterdam, “Pebbles” in 2021; and Venice, “The Disciple” in 2020. The Museum of Modern Art in New York opened a 2022 showcase of independent movies from India by proclaiming: “Indian cinema’s diversity has been energized by a growing number of impressive independent works.” And documentaries have especially garnered the spotlight recently with Academy Award nominations, including “All That Breathes” and “Writing with Fire,” despite having no consistent theatrical distribution within India. “I think the spirit of independent films in India has always been strong,” Deepti DCunha, artistic director of the Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival, said. “But very few people have the access and they can find it difficult to get their movies seen anywhere.” What’s helped many Indian filmmakers are co-productions with European countries, and the chance to get exposure to potential producers at the annual Film Bazaar, an event in Goa with a curated market for Indian films, producers and programmers visiting from abroad, and work-in-progress labs. But another nexus for a recent generation of independent filmmakers is film school. The Film and Television Institute of India (F.T.I.I.) in Pune, which Kapadia attended, is one such bastion, as is Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi. “The F.T.I.I. has provided an indefatigable supply of not only technicians in terms of editors, sound people, D.O.P.s [directors of photography] and so on, but also directors,” Shaunak Sen, who directed “All That Breathes,” said in an interview from Delhi. Sen counts himself lucky: his film about two brothers running a bird clinic in Delhi went to Sundance, Cannes and the Oscars, and was picked up by HBO. But he sees what independent filmmakers can face in India, “where you know you’re staring at this mammoth industry of Bollywood, working in a tiny nook, and trying to will a film into existence.” Kapadia’s film was in development since late 2018, taking time to find funding. She was writing the script for “All We Imagine as Light” while she was still making her documentary “A Night of Knowing Nothing.” The F.T.I.I. was central to Kapadia’s career, and where she met her partner, whom she also works with, and other “go-to film companions.” But an international connection was important: She worked on both films with a young French company, learning together as they moved from small documentary production to a sometimes 80-person crew for “All We Imagine as Light.” (“Big crew, small film!” she said with a laugh.) The French co-production also had support from the Netherlands through the Hubert Bals Fund of the International Film Festival Rotterdam, which supports filmmakers across the globe at various stages of creating their movies. “The independent film industry in Europe is really well designed. They support you at every stage,” Kapadia said, listing off grants for script writing, production, postproduction and distribution. She mused what it would be like if India could adopt the French system of levying taxes on ticket sales that can be used to support independent filmmaking. (She’s not alone in wondering: An editorial in the Indian Express said Kapadia’s inclusion offered “an opportunity to introspect on why it has taken three decades for a film from one of the world’s top film-producing nations to once again make it to this eminent stage.”) These are the challenges that filmmakers like Kapadia must master, not just to make their movies but to find audiences. Programmers at international festivals can help with encouraging independent voices, viewing works in progress in India or through links. In the case of the ACID selection, “In Retreat,” the filmmaker Ali (another F.T.I.I. graduate) submitted the film, which was one of hundreds considered by the programming team. Shot in the high-altitude Ladakh region, it’s the story of a middle-aged man trying to return home to a mountain town for his brother’s funeral. “I didn’t know the director was young, because when you see the film, it’s incredibly deep, really mature,” Pamela Varela, one of ACID’s programmers, said, before bestowing the highest auteurist compliment. “This is really a film by someone. You see it from the first sequence, which is amazing.” The up-and-coming generations of Indian independent filmmakers share a willingness to experiment formally and, outside of the demands of a studio and mass market, might have more freedom to confront political issues of inequality or caste, for example. “Especially if it’s a French co-production,” Kapadia said with a smile. “They are very much for free speech, so they are quite supportive of whatever you want to do.” These filmmakers find kinship both at home and abroad. Kapadia compared making films to “making a quilt, a craft” and mentioned the Indian filmmakers Yashaswini Raghunandan and Ekta Mittal. Like cinephiles globally, filmmakers are in tune with directors from across the world, though Sen also cited the particular “neighborly” bond with other South Asian cinemas that reflect a postcolonial modernity. When it comes to the independent “new wave,” though, don’t call it a comeback: By all accounts, the talent was always there. Cannes just presents a dazzlingly bright spotlight and opportunity. “I don’t think it is that we have recently seen a new wave in talent,” DCunha said. “It’s more that now Europe is paying attention, or America’s paying attention.”",first time year cannes film festival indian film compete palme dor main competition alongside new movie francis ford coppola yorgos lanthimos andrea arnold dry spell

nytimes,Canadian Arrests Highlight Alleged Gang Role in India’s Intelligence Operations,"May 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/world/asia/canada-india-sikh-arrests-gangs.html,"Months after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada accused India’s government of plotting a murder on Canadian soil — plunging diplomatic relations between the two countries to their lowest level ever — the first arrests in the killing, which came on Friday, did little to demystify the basis of his claim. The police didn’t offer clues or present any evidence that India had orchestrated the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh nationalist leader who was gunned down at the temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia, in June. What they did say was that three Indian men had committed the killing and that an investigation into India’s role was ongoing. Before the arrests, Indian officials had maintained that Canada was trying to drag New Delhi into what it described as essentially a rivalry between gangs whose members were long wanted for crimes back in India. After the arrests, a report from the CBC, Canada’s public broadcasting corporation, based on anonymous sources, also said the suspects belonged to an Indian criminal gang. But analysts and former officials said that the possible role of a gang in the killing does not necessarily mean the Indian government was not involved in the crime. India’s external spy agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, or RAW, has long been suspected of tapping into criminal networks to carry out operations in its immediate neighborhood in South Asia while maintaining deniability. Canada’s accusation, if proven, that India orchestrated the Nijjar killing — and a similar accusation made soon after by the United States in a different case — may suggest that RAW is now extending its playbook of working with criminals to carry out operations in Western countries, analysts said. U.S. officials have produced strong evidence in their accusation that an agent of the Indian government participated in a foiled attempt to assassinate a dual American-Canadian citizen. And Canada and allied officials have maintained that Canada has evidence supporting Mr. Trudeau’s claim that Indian agents carried out Mr. Nijjar’s killing. But the Canadian failure to reveal any evidence that India took part, nine months after Mr. Trudeau’s explosive allegation, leaves the killing of Mr. Nijjar in the realm of accusations and counter-accusation in what is a highly tense political environment in both countries, analysts said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been flexing his muscles as a nationalist strongman, pitching himself during his ongoing campaign for a third-term in office as a protector of India who would go as far as it takes to target security threats. During speeches, he has boasted about how his government eliminates enemies by “descending in their homes.” While he has made those references in relation to the country’s archenemy — Pakistan — right wing accounts on social media had celebrated the slaying of Mr. Nijjar in Canada as a similar reach of Mr. Modi’s long arm. Mr. Trudeau, on the other hand, had been facing criticism of weakness in the face of Chinese election interference activities on Canadian soil, and his getting ahead of the Nijjar killing was seen as compensating for that. Canadian police announced on Friday that they had arrested the three Indian men in Edmonton, Alberta, the same day and charged them with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the killing of Mr. Nijjar. The suspects had been living in Canada for three to five years but were not permanent residents of Canada, the police said. The gang that the CBC reported that the hit-men are connected to is led by Lawrence Bishnoi, 31, who is accused of several cases of murder, extortion and narcotics trafficking. He has orchestrated much of it from an Indian jail, where he has been held since 2014. His members are seen as being behind the murder of a popular Punjabi rapper, and threats of attacks on Bollywood celebrities. Indian security officials have frequently arrested criminals connected to Mr. Bishnoi, often with allegations that the gang’s network stretched as far as Canada and overlapped with those promoting from Canadian soil the cause of Khalistan, a once deeply violent separatist movement with the goal of carving out the Indian state of Punjab as an independent nation. A large Sikh diaspora resides in Canada, many of them having migrated there after a violent and often indiscriminate crackdown by the Indian government in the 1980s against the movement for an independent Khalistan. While the cause has largely died down inside India, it continues to have supporters among some segments of the diaspora. The Indian government has accused Canada, and several other Western countries, of not doing enough to crack down on the separatists. Analysts and former security officials said that in India’s immediate geographic neighborhood, RAW has often been willing to venture into murky spaces to recruit killers. Senior officials of Mr. Modi’s administration, including Ajit Doval, the storied former spymaster who now serves as his longtime national security adviser, have in the past been accused of reaching into the underworld to find hit men willing to go after targets both inside the country as well as abroad. Mr. Bishnoi has demonstrated enormous power from behind bars, even giving a television interview from jail last year to pitch himself as a nationalist warrior rather than a criminal mastermind. That, one former security official said, was a signal of his trying to align himself with the spirit of nationalism for a potential deal. “I am a nationalist,” Mr. Bishnoi said in that interview. “I am against Khalistan. I am against Pakistan.” Ajai Sahni, a security analyst who runs the South Asia Terrorism Portal in New Delhi, said the exploitation of criminal gangs by spy agencies to carry out operations with deniability was something that “happens all over the world.” “It is definitely possible for agencies like RAW to use gang rivalries instead of exposing their own covert operators,” Mr. Sahni added. “But just because that is generally how one would expect it to be done, it doesn’t necessarily mean we know this is exactly the case in Nijjar’s killing.” The failed plot on American soil had some of the sloppy hallmarks of an agency trying to extend an old playbook into a different, unfamiliar space. A U.S. indictment in November laid out evidence, including electronic communication and cash transactions between the hired hit man — who turned out to be an undercover cop — a boastful middleman, and an Indian intelligence handler whom The Washington Post recently identified as Vikram Yadav. The Indian government’s response suggested worry: India’s top diplomat said the action was not government policy, while the government announced an investigation into the matter and promised cooperation with the United States. Canada’s case has played out very differently. The country has not publicly disclosed any evidence backing up Mr. Trudeau’s claim, even as allied officials said in September that Canadian officials had found a “smoking gun”: intercepted communications of Indian diplomats in Canada indicating involvement in the plot. Indian officials have pushed back against Mr. Trudeau’s claims with the kind of aggression that suggested it either wasn’t involved or that it was confident of its deniability. The Indian government expelled Canadian diplomats, and doubled down by putting out a list of individuals on Canadian soil that it said were long wanted as part of what it described as a crime and terror nexus. Last week, officials in Mr. Modi’s government jumped on scenes of an event that Mr. Trudeau had attended to say it showed his accusations were simply to appease what they say is a Sikh vote bank for him. They pointed to videos of an event where Mr. Trudeau was the chief guest and where chants of “long live Khalistan” were shouted. Mr. Trudeau, in his speech, said he will always be there “to protect your rights and your freedoms, and we will always defend your community against hatred.” After the speech, the Indian foreign ministry summoned Canada’s second highest ranking diplomat in New Delhi to lodge a complaint. “His remarks to us illustrates once again the kind of political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism and people who practice violence,” Randhir Jaiswal, the foreign ministry spokesman, said at a news conference.",month prime minister justin trudeau canada accused india

nytimes,Biden Calls Japan and India ‘Xenophobic’ in Defending U.S. Immigration,"May 2, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/us/politics/biden-japan-india-immigration.html,"For months, President Biden has been under pressure to prove he can be tough at the border. But at a campaign reception on Wednesday night, he also tried to voice his commitment to America’s long history of immigration. He did so by taking a swipe at two of America’s partners, saying that Japan and India are struggling economically “because they’re xenophobic.” He said the two democratic countries, along with China and Russia, “don’t want immigrants.” “Immigrants are what makes us strong,” the president told the crowd of supporters. “Not a joke. That’s not hyperbole, because we have an influx of workers who want to be here and want to contribute.” The comments have the potential to be a diplomatic irritant for the administration, which has spent years courting the governments of both Japan and India as part of the president’s strategy to counter Chinese aggression in the region. Japan and India are two of the five allies Mr. Biden has hosted with state dinners at the White House since taking office. John F. Kirby, the national security spokesman at the White House, told reporters Thursday that Mr. Biden was trying to make a comment about America’s immigrant “DNA,” not insult other countries. And he insisted that officials in India and Japan understand that. “Our allies and partners know well in tangible ways how President Biden values them, their friendship, their cooperation,” Mr. Kirby said. But the president’s comments also underscore how Mr. Biden is trying to find a politically palatable balance on immigration as he seeks a second term in the White House. In response to anger from Republicans and Democrats about historic surges of migrants at the southern border, the president signed off on the most restrictive immigration legislation in years. That legislation stalled in Congress, but now Mr. Biden is considering whether to use his executive power to enact a severe crackdown on asylum on his own. At the same time, Mr. Biden is trying to assert the moral high ground on the country’s treatment of migrants by drawing a contrast with former President Donald J. Trump and his yearslong assault on immigration. During the 2020 campaign, Mr. Biden repeatedly attacked Mr. Trump for supporting what he called racist and xenophobic policies. On his first day in office, Mr. Biden proposed a comprehensive overhaul of the nation’s immigration system that would have expanded rights for immigrants. Many advocates for immigrants have said they expected explicit support for what the president called a “humane” approach to immigration to continue in Mr. Biden’s White House. But the reality has been more complicated. As the situation on the border worsened, demands for tougher action grew — even from the president’s Democratic allies in big cities like Chicago, New York and Denver. While Mr. Biden has proposed new legal options for some migrants to enter the United States, his policies and rhetoric have become more forceful. In January, as Congress was considering the immigration legislation, Mr. Biden said he was eager to use it to shut down the border. “If given that authority,” he said, “I would use it the day I sign the bill into law.” Maribel Hernández Rivera, the director of policy and government affairs for the border and immigration at the A.C.L.U., said Thursday that she hoped the president’s comments at the fund-raiser indicated that he was reconsidering some of those tougher proposals. “The first thing he did was propose immigration reform, right? So that was a good thing,” she said, referring to Mr. Biden’s early actions as president. “We also, unfortunately, have seen other policies that are not helpful, such as trying to limit asylum, access to asylum for vulnerable people.” She added: “Banning asylum in any way goes against both international and national domestic laws. That is not the solution.” On Thursday, Mr. Kirby sought to emphasize that the president believed in the importance of immigration to the economic success of the United States. “Look, I think the broader point that the president was making, and I think people all around the world recognize this, that the United States is a nation of immigrants and it’s in our DNA,” he said. “We’re better for it. We’re stronger for it. We’re not going to walk away from it. And that’s the broader point that he would make.”",month president biden pressure prove tough border campaign reception wednesday night also tried voice commitment america long history immigration taking swipe two america partner saying japan india struggling economically theyre xenophobic said two democratic country along china russia dont want immigrant immigrant make u strong president told crowd supporter joke thats hyperbole influx worker want want contribute comment potential diplomatic irritant administration spent year courting government japan india part president strategy counter chinese aggression region japan india two five ally mr biden hosted state dinner white house since taking office john f kirby national security spokesman white house told reporter thursday mr biden trying make comment america immigrant dna insult country insisted official india japan understand ally partner know well tangible way president biden value friendship cooperation mr kirby said president comment also underscore mr biden trying find politically palatable balance immigration seek second term white house response anger republican democrat historic surge migrant southern border president signed restrictive immigration legislation year legislation stalled congress mr biden considering whether use executive power enact severe crackdown asylum time mr biden trying assert moral high ground country treatment migrant drawing contrast former president donald j trump yearslong assault immigration campaign mr biden repeatedly attacked mr trump supporting called racist xenophobic policy first day office mr biden proposed comprehensive overhaul nation immigration system would expanded right immigrant many advocate immigrant said expected explicit support president called humane approach immigration continue mr bidens white house reality complicated situation border worsened demand tougher action grew even president democratic ally big city like chicago new york denver mr biden proposed new legal option migrant enter united state policy rhetoric become forceful january congress considering immigration legislation mr biden said eager use shut border given authority said would use day sign bill law maribel hernndez rivera director policy government affair border immigration aclu said thursday hoped president comment fundraiser indicated reconsidering tougher proposal first thing propose immigration reform right good thing said referring mr bidens early action president also unfortunately seen policy helpful trying limit asylum access asylum vulnerable people added banning asylum way go international national domestic law solution thursday mr kirby sought emphasize president believed importance immigration economic success united state look think broader point president making think people around world recognize united state nation immigrant dna said better stronger going walk away thats broader point would make
nytimes,"When My Mom Got Sick, This TV Show Kept Us Going","May 1, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/magazine/indian-idol-cancer.html,"Every family has its archetypes, so here’s mine: My dad and my brother and I are all miserable. None of us are quick to experience joy, and all for different reasons — my dad is irritable, my brother is anxious and I’m bitter. The three of us combined could make one moderately unwell person. Instead, we are planets that orbit a sun more optimistic than we could ever be, and we hope that some of that shine rubs off on us periodically. My mother believes in a positive ethos: that things invariably will improve, that everyone is trying their best, that it’s better to be surprised by harm than anticipating it all the time. In April 2023, I was laid off from my job, and she reassured me immediately. “Everything always works out,” she said. But for the first time, I noticed a slash of worry run across her face. It looked as if she was losing her radiance. I later learned that my mother had been hiding something important from my brother and me for a month: She’d had a biopsy to determine if she had breast cancer. Within weeks of her 69th birthday, she had a lumpectomy. The doctors told her she would need an exhausting surgery, and then exhaustive radiation. For a little under a year, she went through treatment, and steadily she changed — she became sour, nihilistic and impenetrably dark, just like the rest of us. I had never seen it before, and I didn’t know what to do with it other than try to change her mind. Who was this woman? Every few weeks I’d fly home to find my mother again. Cancer robbed my mom of most pleasures. Food was rendered tasteless at best and inedible at worst; she’d push a plate of cheese and crackers away like a child, pantomiming vomiting at every meal. Radiation gave her brain fog, so it was challenging for her to follow along in a book or a movie. She didn’t find anything on TV funny anymore. She didn’t find me very funny either. She was morose and weepy no matter what the day looked like. In her displeasure, she found only blips of joy. Rummy after lunch, a heating pad on the breast, wearing a mastectomy bra that I lied about and said was given to me free in order to avoid arguing about the cost. But nothing brought her consistent pleasure like the Hindi version of “American Idol.” New episodes aired twice a week, and we would record it and watch after dinner. Only during “Indian Idol” was she upright, eyes peeled, singing along. Having just wrapped its 14th season, “Indian Idol” has been on since 2004 and has aired 179 episodes. On the South Asian TV channel my parents paid a premium for (“This,” I used to grumble as a kid, “but not Cartoon Network?”), reruns seemed to play daily, for months. “How come no one is getting kicked off?” I asked my mom after seeing the same contestants on the show for three weeks straight. “Oh, it takes a while,” she said, which was a big deal. It was always a big deal when she spoke at all. “Everyone always seems to get the same number of votes.” If you watch “American Idol” — or “Canadian Idol,” as I did growing up — you’ll know that the most interesting parts of the show are the brutal, often cruel criticisms contestants face. But that doesn’t happen on “Indian Idol,” where every competitor is genuinely one of the most amazing singers you’ve ever heard (the show typically features contestants who very capably sing a catalog of vocally demanding Bollywood tunes). The show is structured in such a way that weeks can go by without an elimination — there are noncompetitive audition and coaching phases which stretch for long periods. Viewers, it seems, appreciate the chance to watch months and months of really excellent karaoke, no matter who wins at the end. I don’t like reality competition shows, but I grew to appreciate “Indian Idol.” I valued the repetition, week after week — the rules didn’t make sense, the music was redundant and there was no real tension. When I watched with my mom, the judges hardly spoke an ill word about anyone’s performance. In fact, there was no friction at all. The worst thing the show did was engage in some vague poverty porn, portraying most of its contestants as low-income desperates who think of nothing but family and religion. But I was grateful for the absence of conflict. We tuned in to a world where everyone was a winner. In the episodes we watched together, all the contestants survived another week. It was that sameness of “Indian Idol” that anchored us as we navigated the unpredictable reality of her illness: Would my mother eat today? Would her pain be so debilitating that she would wail through the afternoon? Would she sleep? Would the drugs make lucidity impossible? Is today a day for her, or for her cancer? Who cares! During “Indian Idol,” I could coax her with a THC edible or two, maybe a piece of fruit. Her eyes would open. We could forget that we had lost the routine we used to take for granted. My mother just turned 70, and is now in remission. I flew back home to see her for her birthday. She refused most of my overtures: no big party, no big banquet, no big attention. “Dim sum might be nice,” she said about a dinner reservation for just us, our sun and her ugly little planets. It was the first time since her diagnosis that food sounded like it could offer her pleasure again. I can trick myself into believing things can remain this way. We have so few guarantees in life, but there are two I know for sure: My mother, for now, is cancer-free; and this week, no one’s going to be kicked off “Indian Idol.”",every family archetype here mine dad brother miserable none u quick experience joy different reason dad irritable brother anxious im bitter three u combined could make one moderately unwell person instead planet orbit sun optimistic could ever hope shine rub u periodically mother belief positive ethos thing invariably improve everyone trying best better surprised harm anticipating time april laid job reassured immediately everything always work said first time noticed slash worry run across face looked losing radiance later learned mother hiding something important brother month shed biopsy determine breast cancer within week th birthday lumpectomy doctor told would need exhausting surgery exhaustive radiation little year went treatment steadily changed became sour nihilistic impenetrably dark like rest u never seen didnt know try change mind woman every week id fly home find mother cancer robbed mom pleasure food rendered tasteless best inedible worst shed push plate cheese cracker away like child pantomiming vomiting every meal radiation gave brain fog challenging follow along book movie didnt find anything tv funny anymore didnt find funny either morose weepy matter day looked like displeasure found blip joy rummy lunch heating pad breast wearing mastectomy bra lied said given free order avoid arguing cost nothing brought consistent pleasure like hindi version american idol new episode aired twice week would record watch dinner indian idol upright eye peeled singing along wrapped th season indian idol since aired episode south asian tv channel parent paid premium used grumble kid cartoon network rerun seemed play daily month come one getting kicked asked mom seeing contestant show three week straight oh take said big deal always big deal spoke everyone always seems get number vote watch american idol canadian idol growing youll know interesting part show brutal often cruel criticism contestant face doesnt happen indian idol every competitor genuinely one amazing singer youve ever heard show typically feature contestant capably sing catalog vocally demanding bollywood tune show structured way week go without elimination noncompetitive audition coaching phase stretch long period viewer seems appreciate chance watch month month really excellent karaoke matter win end dont like reality competition show grew appreciate indian idol valued repetition week week rule didnt make sense music redundant real tension watched mom judge hardly spoke ill word anyones performance fact friction worst thing show engage vague poverty porn portraying contestant lowincome desperate think nothing family religion grateful absence conflict tuned world everyone winner episode watched together contestant survived another week sameness indian idol anchored u navigated unpredictable reality illness would mother eat today would pain debilitating would wail afternoon would sleep would drug make lucidity impossible today day cancer care indian idol could coax thc edible two maybe piece fruit eye would open could forget lost routine used take granted mother turned remission flew back home see birthday refused overture big party big banquet big attention dim sum might nice said dinner reservation u sun ugly little planet first time since diagnosis food sounded like could offer pleasure trick believing thing remain way guarantee life two know sure mother cancerfree week one going kicked indian idol
nytimes,India’s Master of Nostalgia Takes His Sweeping Vision to Netflix,"May 1, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/world/asia/netflix-heeramandi-bhansali.html,"In the small Bombay theater that showed big films, his father brought him — over and over again — to see the biggest of them all. With every one of his 18 viewings of “Mughal-e-Azam,” a hit 1960 musical about a forbidden romance between a prince and a courtesan, the young boy fell more in love. The rays of light, beamed in black and white, opened to him a world at once majestic and lost. The dialogue, crisp and poetic, lingered in his thoughts. The music swept him to places that only later in life would he fully understand. Bombay would eventually change, to Mumbai. India, cinema and music — they would all change, too. But more than half a century later, Sanjay Leela Bhansali — now 61 and a rare remaining master of the grand old style of Indian filmmaking — has not let go of his seat at that small cinema, Alankar Talkies, on the hem of the city’s red-light district. His mind remains rooted there even as his work moves beyond the theater walls. His latest project, released on Wednesday, is an eight-episode musical drama on Netflix that gives a “Game of Thrones” treatment to an exalted milieu of courtesans in pre-independence India. The show, “Heeramandi,” affords more space for Mr. Bhansali’s expansive and exacting approach than any two-hour movie. But it also presents a tricky challenge. How, with big-budget texture and color, do you bring the splendor and grandiosity of royalty — in his imagination, the courtesans lived like queens — to an audience that, at least in his home country of India, will largely be watching on tiny mobile screens? One answer is technical: more close-up shots. The other is personal: a vision all his own. With his decades of commercial success, he has the license to hold tight to the kind of cinema — song-filled nostalgia mixed with obsessive attention to light and detail — he fell in love with early, and forever. “I am still in Alankar Talkies,” he said in an interview last summer, between shoots. “I am seeing it on that big screen over there.” Outside, Mumbai was drenched in monsoon rains. Inside, under the hangar that covered the three-acre set, Mr. Bhansali was lost in a city born as much of imagination as research. Hundreds of workers had toiled for nearly 10 months to create his Lahore of the early 1900s. The furniture was vintage. The curtains and the miniature patterns on the corridor walls were hand-painted, then aged. The slogans on the city walls, the store signs — all calligraphy, aged and faded. When his friend Moin Beg brought him a 14-page concept for the project about 20 years ago, Mr. Bhansali sat on it. There were too many characters, too many things going on, for a feature film. In the years that followed, Mr. Bhansali felt as if he was training himself “to handle big scale.” He made successful films — more recently in a shrinking environment for artistic expression that made him the subject of violent attack — that dealt with dancing girls and royal courts. A consistent theme was complex, powerful, beautiful women. Another big step: He began creating the music for his own movies. Some of his deepest artistic questions since childhood were triggered by music. Through music came a belief that any artist is a 200-year-old or 300-year-old soul. The artistic process is a slow discovery of what the soul already knows. Inside Alankar Talkies, the boy would forget about the actors on the screen and be transported by the voice of the Indian singer Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. “Somewhere, the soul started responding to it,” he said, “‘that I kind of understand this, I know where my father is trying to take me because I’ve traveled somewhere in the past.’” His heart was set on “Heeramandi” because so much came together in one world: refined taste, classical music and dance, power politics and powerful women. Before independence in 1947, India was a collection of princely states under British rule. Elite patronage had given rise to quarters of courtesans, and an ecosystem of music, dance and fashion grew around them. Heeramandi was one such place in the city of Lahore, which after India’s partition became part of Pakistan. The Urdu-language writer Shorish Kashmiri described Heeramandi even in its decline as “an art gallery where the nights remain awake and the days sleep.” The Netflix series captures a Heeramandi where the courtesans know they are the last of their kind. But in Mr. Bhansali’s vision, their end is not a slow march to nothingness. He merges the women into the whirlwind of India’s freedom movement. “I always grant my characters a lot more than they actually deserved in life,” he said. “I wanted them to be bathed in fountains — big corridors and big mirrors, so that the reflections seem larger than life.” On his sets, it is complete surrender to a vision that keeps changing in Mr. Bhansali’s head. Some actors have described his process as torturous, his temper difficult. Others have likened it to film school. “What my role started as, and what it became — a lot of it happened on paper, and a lot of it happened on the set,” said Sonakshi Sinha, a lead actress in the series. Ms. Sinha was shooting two small segments that day. First was the final bit of a song. In its climax, Ms. Sinha’s character sways through a crowd of party guests in her drawing room, toward her veranda, drink in hand. She stares at a rival madam across the street, raises her glass and tosses it down. In take after take, Mr. Bhansali drove a point home: Every move, every gesture, had to be done so that the eyes, the glare, remained the focus. “If you arrive and just pour, then there is no joy,” he told Ms. Sinha. “Take a beat.” The segment they shot next demonstrated how Mr. Bhansali thinks, and how he obsesses. It was supposed to be simple: Ms. Sinha’s character would put out some candles, symbolizing a closing down at Heeramandi so the courtesans could join the freedom fight. During a bathroom break, Mr. Bhansali walked past a chandelier. As he stood at the urinal, he had a new vision: Ms. Sinha’s character would use a pulley to pull up the chandelier, wrapped in a drape, then walk away as the lights went out. It took five hours to light and complete the shot, for a 10-second scene. Frustrated that it was not quite right, Mr. Bhansali turned to what helps connect him to his abstraction: music. He asked an assistant to play an old song, a ghazal, on an iPad. The voice softly filled the air — then another take. When his father, a producer who never made it, was on his deathbed, he had a peculiar request: He dispatched his son to get a cassette of a tribal singer who, after India was split, had ended up on the other side, where their own family had roots. He wanted to hear the song “Hayo Raba” by Reshma — a voice raw, untrained. By the time young Sanjay returned with the cassette, his father was unconscious. He stood there watching his dilated eyes — a scene that still plays out in his mind. “He had gone into a coma,” Mr. Bhansali said. “I had no place to play ‘Hayo Rabba,’ and my mother kept saying, ‘Play “Hayo Rabba”!’” Why that song? The closest he comes to an answer is that in his father’s state of hallucination, he was connecting with his ancestors. “Life is so fascinating,” he said. “Can films ever capture this?” He has spent his life seeing if it can. When he was about 6, his father took him to a film set. He told him to wait in a corner while he talked to his friends. A cabaret was being shot. “A skimpily dressed woman was eating an apple and throwing it on a semi-naked man,” he recalled. As he looked up — to the catwalk with hanging ropes and lights and screens — he was lost in wonderment. “I realized I don’t want to be on the cricket ground, I don’t want to be in school, I don’t want to be anywhere. I want to be here. This is my place,” he said. “That woman biting that apple, throwing it on the man — I think that kid was seduced.”",small bombay theater showed big film father brought see biggest every one viewing

nytimes,Australian Journalist Says She Was Pushed Out of India,"April 24, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/world/asia/india-australia-journalist-avani-dias.html,"A senior journalist with Australia’s national broadcaster says she was effectively pushed out of India after her reporting on Sikh separatism angered the Indian government, accusing the authorities of hindering her from going to events, seeking to have her reporting taken down and refusing for weeks to renew her visa. Avani Dias, the South Asia correspondent for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, said on social media that Indian officials told her last month that her application for a resident journalist visa extension would not be approved because a television segment she had produced on accusations that India was responsible for the killing of a Sikh activist in Canada had “crossed the line.” She was eventually granted a temporary visa extension at the last minute after lobbying by the Australian government, less than a day before she was scheduled to leave the country, Ms. Dias said in her podcast, “Looking for Modi.” But she said that she ultimately decided to leave because “it felt too difficult to do my job in India.” “I was struggling to get into public events run by Modi’s party,” Ms. Dias said on the podcast, which was about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Indian government has disputed Ms. Dias’ account and said she was assured by high ranking officials that her visa would be renewed. Her departure came amid a broader crackdown on free speech in the country and raids on journalists reporting on sensitive topics. During his 10 years leading the nation, Mr. Modi has consolidated power in India and across its institutions, challenging the founding principles of modern India, like secularism and freedom of the press. He is seeking a third term in parliamentary elections that begun this month. In March, Ms. Dias produced a television segment about the accusations made by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada last year that agents acting on behalf of the Indian government were behind the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist, on Canadian soil. The half-hour documentary examined the movement, which advocates for a separate Sikh state called Khalistan to be carved out of the Indian state of Punjab. During the half-hour documentary, which was broadcast in Australia and uploaded on social media, she detailed how permission for her and her crew to film at the border between Punjab and Pakistan had suddenly been revoked by Indian officials without explanation, and how she had been quizzed by Indian officials about her crew and the places she had visited to report on the story. “It’s clear that we’re being really monitored and that there’s concern about the story that we’re doing,” she said. On March 26, less than a week after the documentary was broadcast, the Indian government successfully sought to have YouTube block the video from showing in India. The next day, Ms. Dias was told by a representative of the Ministry of External Affairs that her application for a visa extension would not be renewed, according to a person directly familiar with the situation but who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the issue. Ms. Dias notified the Australian government, and Australian diplomats began to lobby for her visa, the person said. After weeks of bureaucratic back and forth, Ms. Dias received her visa extension on the evening of Apr. 18, the person said. But with her flight back to Australia departing the next day, and having already packed up her life in India, she made the decision to leave, Ms. Dias said in her podcast. She left on the first day of voting in India’s national election. A senior Indian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, refuted her account, saying Ms. Dias had been told well in advance that her visa would be extended. The official said that Ms. Dias had violated terms of her previous visa by attempting to film at the India-Pakistan border, which requires permission. Ms. Dias previously said she had sought and been granted that permission before it was revoked at the last minute. Ms. Dias had not been prevented from covering India’s election, but had her accreditation delayed because she had not yet received her visa extension, the Indian official said, adding that her colleagues at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation had been given accreditation to cover the elections. Ms. Dias’ departure adds to mounting concerns about press freedom in India, where Indian journalists have come under heavy pressure from the Modi administration. Foreign journalists in India are reporting more pressure, as well. In February, Vanessa Dougnac, a French freelance correspondent, said she had been forced to leave India, where she had lived for 25 years, after the authorities told her that they intended to withdraw her permanent residency permit. The authorities accused her of producing reporting that was “malicious and critical in manner,” and creating a “biased negative perception about India.” They said that she had worked as a journalist without holding a valid permit, after revoking her work permit in September 2022 without a clear reason.",senior journalist australia national broadcaster say effectively pushed india reporting sikh separatism angered indian government accusing authority hindering going event seeking reporting taken refusing week renew visa avani dia south asia correspondent australian broadcasting corporation said social medium indian official told last month application resident journalist visa extension would approved television segment produced accusation india responsible killing sikh activist canada crossed line eventually granted temporary visa extension last minute lobbying australian government le day scheduled leave country m dia said podcast looking modi said ultimately decided leave felt difficult job india struggling get public event run modis party m dia said podcast prime minister narendra modi indian government disputed m dia account said assured high ranking official visa would renewed departure came amid broader crackdown free speech country raid journalist reporting sensitive topic year leading nation mr modi consolidated power india across institution challenging founding principle modern india like secularism freedom press seeking third term parliamentary election begun month march m dia produced television segment accusation made prime minister justin trudeau canada last year agent acting behalf indian government behind killing hardeep singh nijjar sikh separatist canadian soil halfhour documentary examined movement advocate separate sikh state called khalistan carved indian state punjab halfhour documentary broadcast australia uploaded social medium detailed permission crew film border punjab pakistan suddenly revoked indian official without explanation quizzed indian official crew place visited report story clear really monitored there concern story said march le week documentary broadcast indian government successfully sought youtube block video showing india next day m dia told representative ministry external affair application visa extension would renewed according person directly familiar situation spoke condition anonymity sensitive nature issue m dia notified australian government australian diplomat began lobby visa person said week bureaucratic back forth m dia received visa extension evening apr person said flight back australia departing next day already packed life india made decision leave m dia said podcast left first day voting india national election senior indian official speaking condition anonymity refuted account saying m dia told well advance visa would extended official said m dia violated term previous visa attempting film indiapakistan border requires permission m dia previously said sought granted permission revoked last minute m dia prevented covering india election accreditation delayed yet received visa extension indian official said adding colleague australian broadcasting corporation given accreditation cover election m dia departure add mounting concern press freedom india indian journalist come heavy pressure modi administration foreign journalist india reporting pressure well february vanessa dougnac french freelance correspondent said forced leave india lived year authority told intended withdraw permanent residency permit authority accused producing reporting malicious critical manner creating biased negative perception india said worked journalist without holding valid permit revoking work permit september without clear reason
nytimes,Why Did Modi Call India’s Muslims ‘Infiltrators’? Because He Could.,"April 23, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/world/asia/india-modi-muslims.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his power at home secured and his Hindu-first vision deeply entrenched, has set his sights in recent years on a role as a global statesman, riding India’s economic and diplomatic rise. In doing so, he has distanced himself from his party’s staple work of polarizing India’s diverse population along religious lines for its own electoral gain. His silence provided tacit backing as vigilante groups continued to target non-Hindu minority groups and as members of his party routinely used hateful and racist language, even in Parliament, against the largest of those groups, India’s 200 million Muslims. With the pot kept boiling, Mr. Modi’s subtle dog whistles — with references to Muslim dress or burial places — could go a long way domestically while providing enough deniability to ensure that red carpets remained rolled out abroad for the man leading the world’s largest democracy. Just what drove the prime minister to break with this calculated pattern in a fiery campaign speech on Sunday — when he referred to Muslims by name as “infiltrators” with “more children” who would get India’s wealth if his opponents took power — has been hotly debated. It could be a sign of anxiety that his standing with voters is not as firm as believed, analysts said. Or it could be just a reflexive expression of the kind of divisive religious ideology that has fueled his politics from the start. But the brazenness made clear that Mr. Modi sees few checks on his enormous power. At home, watchdog institutions have been largely bent to the will of his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. Abroad, partners increasingly turn a blind eye to what Mr. Modi is doing in India as they embrace the country as a democratic counterweight to China. “Modi is one of the world’s most skilled and experienced politicians,” said Daniel Markey, a senior adviser in the South Asia program at the United States Institute of Peace. “He would not have made these comments unless he believed he could get away with it.” Mr. Modi may have been trying to demonstrate this impunity, Mr. Markey said, “to intimidate the B.J.P.’s political opponents and to show them — and their supporters — just how little they can do in response.” The prime minister sees himself as the builder of a new, modern India on the march toward development and international respect. But he also wants to leave a legacy that is distinctly different from that of the leaders who founded the country as a secular republic after British colonial rule. Before joining its political offshoot, he spent more than a decade as a cultural foot soldier of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., a right-wing organization founded in 1925 with the mission of making India a Hindu state. The group viewed it as treason when an independent India agreed to a partition that created Pakistan as a separate nation for Muslims, embraced secularism and gave all citizens equal rights. A onetime member went so far as to assassinate Mohandas K. Gandhi in outrage. Over his decade in national power, Mr. Modi has been deeply effective in advancing some of the central items of the Hindu-right agenda. He abolished the semi-autonomy of the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir. He enacted a citizenship law widely viewed as prejudiced against Muslims. And he helped see through the construction of a grand temple to the Hindu deity Ram on a plot long disputed between Hindus and Muslims. The violent razing in 1992 of the mosque that had stood on that land — which Hindu groups said was built on the plot of a previous temple — was central to the national movement of Hindu assertiveness that ultimately swept Mr. Modi to power more than two decades later. More profoundly, Mr. Modi has shown that the broader goals of a Hindu state can largely be achieved within the bounds of India’s constitution — by co-opting the institutions meant to protect equality. Officials in his party have a ready rebuttal to any complaint along these lines. How could Mr. Modi discriminate against anyone, they say, if all Indian citizens benefit equally from his government’s robust welfare offerings — of toilets, of roofs over heads, of monthly rations? That argument, analysts say, is telling in showing how Mr. Modi has redefined democratic power not as leadership within checks and balances, but as the broad generosity of a strongman, even as he has redefined citizenship in practice to make clear there is a second class. Secularism — the idea that no religion will be favored over any other — has largely been co-opted to mean that no religion will be allowed to deny Hindus their dominance as the country’s majority, his critics say. Officials under Mr. Modi, who wear their religion on their sleeves and publicly mix prayer with politics, crack down on public expressions of other religions as breaching India’s secularism. While right-wing officials promote conversion to Hinduism, which they describe as a “return home,” they have introduced laws within many of the states they govern that criminalize conversion from Hinduism. Egged on by such leaders, Hindu extremists have lynched Muslim men accused of transporting cows or beef and hounded them over charges of “love jihad” — or luring Hindu women. Vigilantes have frequently barged into churches and accosted priests they believe have engaged in proselytizing or conversion. “What they have done is to create a permissive environment which encourages hate and valorizes hate,” said Harsh Mander, a former civil servant who is now a campaigner for social harmony. In reference to Mr. Modi’s speech on Sunday, he added: “This open resort to this kind of hate speech will only encourage that hard-line Hindu right in society.” Tom Vadakkan, a spokesman for the B.J.P., said the prime minister’s comments on Muslims had been misinterpreted. Mr. Modi, Mr. Vadakkan said, was referring to “intruders” or “illegal migrants” who the party claims are being used by the political opposition to “redefine the demography.” Privately, Western diplomats in New Delhi do little to hide their discomfort with some of Mr. Modi actions as a democratic ally, from the targeting of minorities to his crackdowns on opposition and dissent. But they acknowledge that he is exploiting a particularly open season in the global order, with many of their own capitals providing a less positive example than they once did, and with so much focus on China and trade deals. Mr. Markey, the Washington-based analyst, said the U.S. government was holding back from voicing concerns publicly for several reasons beyond its national interest in having India serve as an economic and geopolitical counterweight to China. The United States, he said, realizes the growing limits of its public criticism in changing partner nations’ behavior. That was demonstrated most recently by the repeated instances in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel ignored President Biden’s demands that the Israeli military change its conduct within the war in Gaza. Criticism of Mr. Modi, Mr. Markey added, could also backfire for U.S. politicians who “do not want to get crosswise with Indian diaspora groups.” But Mr. Modi may not remain immune as he pursues closer partnerships with the United States in areas like joint weapons manufacturing, transfer of high technology and sharing of intelligence. “My sense is that Washington’s increasing discomfort with Modi’s domestic politics is gradually lowering the ceiling of potential U.S. cooperation with India,” Mr. Markey said. “The question is just how far Washington is willing to trust India. Will India be treated as an ally in everything but name, or as a partner more like Vietnam or Saudi Arabia?”",prime minister narendra modi power home secured hindufirst vision deeply entrenched set

nytimes,Man Accused in Plot to Assassinate Sikh Separatist Pleads Not Guilty,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/nyregion/nikhil-gupta-india-assassination-plot.html,"An Indian man pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of orchestrating a failed assassination plot against a Sikh separatist in New York, a plan that prosecutors say he devised on behalf of an unnamed official in India’s government. The defendant, Nikhil Gupta, 52, was arrested in the Czech Republic a year ago, and was extradited last week to make his first appearance in Manhattan federal court. He is accused of trying to arrange the murder of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American citizen and lawyer for a New York-based Sikh secessionist group. The murder attempt, which played out against a backdrop of doubt about India’s commitment to democracy, spanned several countries and mirrored the successful killing of another separatist in Canada, prosecutors say. On Monday morning, Mr. Gupta entered the Lower Manhattan courtroom in a blue cardigan and yellow patterned shirt and appeared relaxed as he spoke to his lawyer, Jeffrey Chabrowe, at the defense table. He has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since landing in the United States on Friday afternoon. In a statement to reporters after the arraignment, Mr. Chabrowe called the case a “complex matter"" for India and the United States. “Background and details will develop that may cast government allegations into an entirely new light,” he said. Mr. Gupta is charged with murder for hire and conspiracy to commit murder for hire. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison for each charge. He was sent back to the detention center after Monday’s arraignment and is set to appear in court again on June 28. In a statement Monday, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said Mr. Gupta will “now face justice” in an American courtroom. “This extradition makes clear that the Justice Department will not tolerate attempts to silence or harm American citizens,” he said. In an indictment unsealed in November, Manhattan federal prosecutors described an audacious plot that began around May 2023 when an Indian government employee enlisted Mr. Gupta to organize the killing of Mr. Pannun, who was living in New York at the time. Mr. Pannun is the general counsel of Sikhs for Justice, an organization that supports the secession of Punjab, a state in northern India. He is a vocal critic of the Indian government and has been banned from the country, prosecutors say. Mr. Gupta, who lived in India, had told the government official about “his involvement in international narcotics and weapons trafficking,” according to the indictment. At the direction of the Indian government employee, Mr. Gupta contacted a man who he believed would help him hire a hit man in New York, but who was, in fact, an agent for the American government. That agent introduced Mr. Gupta to an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration officer who pretended to be the hit man. In deals brokered by Mr. Gupta, the Indian government official agreed to pay the D.E.A. officer $100,000 to kill Mr. Pannun, including a $15,000 cash advance for the job, prosecutors said. Mr. Gupta then shared personal information about Mr. Pannun with the undercover officer, including Mr. Pannun’s address in New York and his phone number. When the Indian official asked for updates, Mr. Gupta relayed surveillance photos of Mr. Pannun that the agent had sent him. Mr. Gupta instructed the undercover officer to carry out the assassination as soon as possible, but asked him not to do it around the time of high-level meetings between U.S. and Indian officials, according to the indictment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington and met with President Biden in June 2023. Then, prosecutors said, on June 18 of that year, gunmen killed Hardeep Singh Nijjar, another Sikh separatist leader, in British Columbia, Canada. Mr. Nijjar knew Mr. Pannun and was also an outspoken critic of the Indian government. Soon after, prosecutors said, Mr. Gupta told the undercover officer that Mr. Nijjar “was also the target” and that “we have so many targets.” Mr. Gupta then told the officer — the pretend hit man — that there was “now no need to wait” to kill Mr. Pannun, prosecutors said. On Monday, Mr. Pannun said in a statement that he had “full faith” that the United States would hold Mr. Gupta and his co-conspirators accountable. “The attempt on my life on American soil is the blatant case of India’s transnational terrorism challenging America’s sovereignty and unequivocally proves that Modi’s India believes in using violence to suppress the dissenting political opinion,” he said. A spokesman for the Indian Embassy in Washington, D.C., could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. Mr. Gupta’s case has threatened to complicate the delicate relations among Washington, Ottawa and New Delhi. During his presidency, Mr. Biden has courted India’s leaders to counter the influence of Russia and China, despite growing concerns about India’s commitment to democracy. Mr. Modi, who has been in office since 2014, was re-elected as India’s prime minister in June, even as his Bharatiya Janata Party lost its majority in Parliament.",indian man pleaded guilty monday charge orchestrating failed assassination plot sikh separatist new york plan prosecutor say devised behalf unnamed official india government defendant nikhil gupta arrested czech republic year ago extradited last week make first appearance manhattan federal court accused trying arrange murder gurpatwant singh pannun american citizen lawyer new yorkbased sikh secessionist group murder attempt played backdrop doubt india commitment democracy spanned several country mirrored successful killing another separatist canada prosecutor say monday morning mr gupta entered lower manhattan courtroom blue cardigan yellow patterned shirt appeared relaxed spoke lawyer jeffrey chabrowe defense table held metropolitan detention center brooklyn since landing united state friday afternoon statement reporter arraignment mr chabrowe called case complex matter india united state background detail develop may cast government allegation entirely new light said mr gupta charged murder hire conspiracy commit murder hire convicted would face maximum year prison charge sent back detention center monday arraignment set appear court june statement monday attorney general merrick b garland said mr gupta face justice american courtroom extradition make clear justice department tolerate attempt silence harm american citizen said indictment unsealed november manhattan federal prosecutor described audacious plot began around may indian government employee enlisted mr gupta organize killing mr pannun living new york time mr pannun general counsel sikh justice organization support secession punjab state northern india vocal critic indian government banned country prosecutor say mr gupta lived india told government official involvement international narcotic weapon trafficking according indictment direction indian government employee mr gupta contacted man believed would help hire hit man new york fact agent american government agent introduced mr gupta undercover drug enforcement administration officer pretended hit man deal brokered mr gupta indian government official agreed pay dea officer kill mr pannun including cash advance job prosecutor said mr gupta shared personal information mr pannun undercover officer including mr pannuns address new york phone number indian official asked update mr gupta relayed surveillance photo mr pannun agent sent mr gupta instructed undercover officer carry assassination soon possible asked around time highlevel meeting u indian official according indictment prime minister narendra modi visited washington met president biden june prosecutor said june year gunman killed hardeep singh nijjar another sikh separatist leader british columbia canada mr nijjar knew mr pannun also outspoken critic indian government soon prosecutor said mr gupta told undercover officer mr nijjar also target many target mr gupta told officer pretend hit man need wait kill mr pannun prosecutor said monday mr pannun said statement full faith united state would hold mr gupta coconspirator accountable attempt life american soil blatant case india transnational terrorism challenging america sovereignty unequivocally prof modis india belief using violence suppress dissenting political opinion said spokesman indian embassy washington dc could immediately reached comment monday mr guptas case threatened complicate delicate relation among washington ottawa new delhi presidency mr biden courted india leader counter influence russia china despite growing concern india commitment democracy mr modi office since reelected india prime minister june even bharatiya janata party lost majority parliament
nytimes,Train Crash in India Leaves at Least 8 Dead and Dozens Injured,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/world/asia/india-train-crash.html,"A freight train collided with a passenger train in eastern India on Monday, killing at least eight people and injuring 50 others, officials said. The episode occurred at around 9 a.m. when the Kanchanjunga Express, which was carrying passengers to the state of West Bengal from the state of Tripura, was leaving the Rangapani station. Four coaches of the popular and often-crowded passenger train derailed when it was rammed from behind by the commercial train. Images from the accident site showed one of the passenger coaches lifted off the railway track and balancing on a coach of the freight train. The death toll was likely to rise. Local news outlets, citing police officials, reported at least 15 people dead. The driver and the assistant driver of the freight train and a guard on the passenger train were among those killed. Jaya Varma Sinha, the chairperson of India’s railway board, said rescue operations were completed. Ashwini Vaishnaw, India’s railway minister, was en route to the site. The relatively low number of casualties could be attributed to the fact that the rear portion of the Kanchanjunga Express, which took the biggest impact from the collision, comprised cargo coaches and the guard’s coach. Passengers were in compartments far forward from the impact. While an investigation has been ordered to look into the cause of the collision, Ms. Sinha said human error such as disregarding a railway signal could have caused the crash. The accident again brings to the fore the issue of rail safety in a country whose millions of poor residents rely on railways for transport. India’s rail network is one of the world’s largest and is crucial to the country’s economy and its people’s lives and livelihood. The country has, in recent years, invested heavily on rail safety after a long history of deadly accidents. Although the overall number of rail accidents has lessened over the past decade, incidents with mass casualties have persisted. Last June, 290 people were killed when two passenger trains collided after one of them struck a stationary freight train at full speed and derailed in the state of Odisha. After that incident, opposition leaders demanded the resignation of Mr. Vaishnaw, the railway minister. He has said he was trying to expand a safety system, called Kavach, that is meant to prevent accidents when two trains are moving on the same track. Ms. Sinha said the technology had not yet been deployed on the route of the Kanchanjunga Express.",freight train collided passenger train eastern india monday killing least eight people injuring others official said episode occurred around kanchanjunga express carrying passenger state west bengal state tripura leaving rangapani station four coach popular oftencrowded passenger train derailed rammed behind commercial train image accident site showed one passenger coach lifted railway track balancing coach freight train death toll likely rise local news outlet citing police official reported least people dead driver assistant driver freight train guard passenger train among killed jaya varma sinha chairperson india railway board said rescue operation completed ashwini vaishnaw india railway minister en route site relatively low number casualty could attributed fact rear portion kanchanjunga express took biggest impact collision comprised cargo coach guard coach passenger compartment far forward impact investigation ordered look cause collision m sinha said human error disregarding railway signal could caused crash accident brings fore issue rail safety country whose million poor resident rely railway transport india rail network one world largest crucial country economy people life livelihood country recent year invested heavily rail safety long history deadly accident although overall number rail accident lessened past decade incident mass casualty persisted last june people killed two passenger train collided one struck stationary freight train full speed derailed state odisha incident opposition leader demanded resignation mr vaishnaw railway minister said trying expand safety system called kavach meant prevent accident two train moving track m sinha said technology yet deployed route kanchanjunga express
nytimes,"G7 Leaders, Expanding the Circle, Shift Focus to Migration and the South","June 14, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/world/europe/g7-summit-ai-china-india.html,"The Group of 7 countries threw open the doors of their club on Friday to India, Brazil, Turkey and other non-Western countries, acknowledging a shifting global landscape as they tried to enlist these nations’ leaders in causes ranging from climate change to managing the economic competition with China. While diplomats from the Group of 7 hammered out a communiqué that pledged support for Ukraine in its war against Russia and greater ambition in curbing carbon emissions, the focus was on Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and other leaders from outside the G7, whose support is increasingly critical to achieving any of these goals. Among the thorny questions on the second day of the summit: migration, which has helped fuel a recent resurgence of populism and far-right parties in Europe and the United States. The leaders also discussed the war in Gaza and China’s state subsidies of industries like electric vehicles, which has prompted the United States and the European Union to impose tariffs on Chinese exports. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, who is hosting the gathering, said the goal of her expanded guest list was to “strengthen dialogue with the nations of the Global South.” She insisted that the Group of 7 was “not a fortress closed in itself” but “an offer of values that we open to the world.” Ms. Meloni recruited Pope Francis to speak to the leaders about the dangers posed by artificial intelligence. Francis urged them to regulate the technology, of which he was himself a victim when A.I.-generated fake images of him clad in a white puffer jacket and a jewel-encrusted crucifix went viral last year. “The benefits and the damages it causes will depend on the way it is used,” the pope declared, warning of the risks of A.I.’s uncontrolled development. He called for lethal autonomous weapons, which are unmanned and uncontrolled by a human hand, to be banned, saying, “No machine should ever decide whether to take the life of a human being away.” The pope’s appearance was the emotional highlight of a day of carefully staged summitry that seemed to concede that the West is less dominant demographically and economically than in the past — and that it is listening to calls for more equity and balance in global decision-making. As Ms. Meloni guided the pope, in a wheelchair, around a circular table to meet the leaders, he was greeted by a visibly moved President Biden and got an enthusiastic hug from Argentina’s flamboyant president, Javier Milei, whose election last November was viewed as another sign of the rising tide of populism across the Americas and Europe. This is not the first time non-Western leaders have been invited to a Group of 7 meeting, but rarely have they been so conspicuous. In part that reflects the issues that Ms. Meloni has highlighted: Africa and the Mediterranean. The leaders of Algeria, Kenya and Tunisia were on hand at a luxury resort hotel on Italy’s southern coast, as was President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. “Inviting key developing country leaders reflects the reality that confronting China and Russia requires the cooperation of more than the G7,” said Daniel M. Price, who was a top trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “And Brazil, India and Turkey are as concerned about Chinese predatory trade practices and overcapacity as are Japan, Europe and the U.S.” The final G7 communiqué voiced concern about what the leaders called China’s “persistent industrial targeting and comprehensive nonmarket policies and practices that are leading to global spillovers, market distortions and harmful overcapacity.” The communiqué endorsed Mr. Biden’s effort to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. France and Canada had pushed for stronger language on Israel’s conduct of the war, according to people familiar with the negotiations, but the United States and Germany resisted. In a victory for Ms. Meloni, a conservative who opposes abortion, the communiqué did not include an explicit reference to abortion, in a passage that pledged to promote “comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.” A communiqué released by the Group of 7 leaders after their last summit in Hiroshima, Japan, referred specifically to abortion rights. The issue injected a briefly discordant note into the gathering after President Emmanuel Macron of France told an Italian journalist that some politicians did not share France’s “vision of equality between women and men.” Ms. Meloni criticized Mr. Macron, who recently called a snap parliamentary election, as seeking to politicize the issue at a “precious forum like the G7.” For the most part, however, the meeting underscored harmony among the leaders, many of whom are embattled by their own domestic politics. It also served as a platform for Ms. Meloni, 47, who has overcome initial qualms about her political roots in a party built on the ashes of fascism to win respect for her steadfast support of Ukraine. Presiding over the two days of meetings, she was able to put a spotlight on several of her pet issues. How to control migration has vexed the United States and Europe, compounded by the effects of climate change and warfare in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Ukraine. It is a particularly delicate issue for Ms. Meloni, who has campaigned hard to fight what she has called “uncontrolled immigration” to Italy and other parts of Europe from Africa and the Middle East. While Europe has welcomed thousands of Ukrainians, especially women and children, fleeing the Russian invasion, Ukrainian officials have urged European countries to help them repatriate men of fighting age. “Turkey is a critical player on global migration,” said Peter Westmacott, who served as Britain’s ambassador to Turkey, France and the United States. He noted that there are about three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds and Afghans. “If Europe wants to control migration from these countries,” Mr. Westmacott said, “Turkey is an indispensable partner.” Mr. Erdogan, he said, could also yet play a role in brokering an end to Ukraine’s war with Russia. As a Black Sea power, Turkey has kept open its commercial and political links to Russia. But it is also a NATO member and has supplied cheap, highly effective drones to help the Ukrainian resistance. Some of the invitations reflected diplomatic protocol, according to Italian officials. Brazil, India and South Africa were automatically included as current or future presidents of the Group of 20 industrialized nations. Argentina was invited, these officials said, because Mr. Milei has recognized the connections and interdependence between East and West. He and Ms. Meloni have also cultivated close personal ties, sharing a right-wing populism that includes opposition to abortion and gay rights.",group country threw open door club friday india brazil turkey nonwestern country acknowledging shifting global landscape tried enlist nation leader cause ranging climate change managing economic competition china diplomat group hammered communiqu pledged support ukraine war russia greater ambition curbing carbon emission focus prime minister narendra modi india president luiz incio lula da silva brazil leader outside g whose support increasingly critical achieving goal among thorny question second day summit migration helped fuel recent resurgence populism farright party europe united state leader also discussed war gaza china state subsidy industry like electric vehicle prompted united state european union impose tariff chinese export prime minister giorgia meloni italy hosting gathering said goal expanded guest list strengthen dialogue nation global south insisted group fortress closed offer value open world m meloni recruited pope francis speak leader danger posed artificial intelligence francis urged regulate technology victim aigenerated fake image clad white puffer jacket jewelencrusted crucifix went viral last year benefit damage cause depend way used pope declared warning risk ai uncontrolled development called lethal autonomous weapon unmanned uncontrolled human hand banned saying machine ever decide whether take life human away pope appearance emotional highlight day carefully staged summitry seemed concede west le dominant demographically economically past listening call equity balance global decisionmaking m meloni guided pope wheelchair around circular table meet leader greeted visibly moved president biden got enthusiastic hug argentina flamboyant president javier milei whose election last november viewed another sign rising tide populism across america europe first time nonwestern leader invited group meeting rarely conspicuous part reflects issue m meloni highlighted africa mediterranean leader algeria kenya tunisia hand luxury resort hotel italy southern coast president recep tayyip erdogan turkey inviting key developing country leader reflects reality confronting china russia requires cooperation g said daniel price top trade adviser president george w bush brazil india turkey concerned chinese predatory trade practice overcapacity japan europe u final g communiqu voiced concern leader called china persistent industrial targeting comprehensive nonmarket policy practice leading global spillover market distortion harmful overcapacity communiqu endorsed mr bidens effort broker ceasefire israel hamas gaza france canada pushed stronger language israel conduct war according people familiar negotiation united state germany resisted victory m meloni conservative opposes abortion communiqu include explicit reference abortion passage pledged promote comprehensive sexual reproductive health right communiqu released group leader last summit hiroshima japan referred specifically abortion right issue injected briefly discordant note gathering president emmanuel macron france told italian journalist politician share france vision equality woman men m meloni criticized mr macron recently called snap parliamentary election seeking politicize issue precious forum like g part however meeting underscored harmony among leader many embattled domestic politics also served platform m meloni overcome initial qualm political root party built ash fascism win respect steadfast support ukraine presiding two day meeting able put spotlight several pet issue control migration vexed united state europe compounded effect climate change warfare afghanistan middle east ukraine particularly delicate issue m meloni campaigned hard fight called uncontrolled immigration italy part europe africa middle east europe welcomed thousand ukrainian especially woman child fleeing russian invasion ukrainian official urged european country help repatriate men fighting age turkey critical player global migration said peter westmacott served britain ambassador turkey france united state noted three million syrian refugee turkey well hundred thousand iraqi kurd afghan europe want control migration country mr westmacott said turkey indispensable partner mr erdogan said could also yet play role brokering end ukraine war russia black sea power turkey kept open commercial political link russia also nato member supplied cheap highly effective drone help ukrainian resistance invitation reflected diplomatic protocol according italian official brazil india south africa automatically included current future president group industrialized nation argentina invited official said mr milei recognized connection interdependence east west m meloni also cultivated close personal tie sharing rightwing populism includes opposition abortion gay right
nytimes,Fire in Kuwait Worker Housing Leaves at Least 49 Dead,"June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/world/middleeast/fire-kuwait-migrant-worker-housing.html,"At least 49 people were killed and dozens of others injured in the Persian Gulf country of Kuwait, the state news agency said, when a fire broke out on Wednesday in a building that housed scores of low-income workers, many of them Indian nationals. The fire began during the morning in a coastal area called Mangaf, about half an hour’s drive from the center of the capital, Kuwait City. The Kuwaiti authorities have held the building owner for questioning as they investigate the cause of the fire and try to determine whether “any shortcoming or neglect” played a role, the state news agency reported. The authorities promised to begin a campaign to tackle building code violations. The public prosecutor’s office also planned to inspect the site and interview survivors. Speaking to journalists at the site of the fire, Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Al Sabah — Kuwait’s deputy prime minister and interior minister — blamed “the greed of property owners” for the disaster and said that the owner of the company employing the workers would also be detained, the Reuters news agency and Kuwaiti newspapers reported. Jayashankar, an Indian salesman who survived the fire, said that he awoke to screams around 4 a.m. local time. He and his roommates opened the door to their fourth-floor apartment and found that thick black smoke had enveloped the corridor, burning their lungs, he said in a phone interview, asking to be identified by his first name only for fear of retribution. Instead of trying to escape, he said, they locked the door, opened a window and waited for help. Two of his roommates who left the apartment to find an exit later died, he said. Witnesses told local news outlets that the fire had begun at the bottom of the seven-story building, sending smoke billowing upward. In a televised interview, an official in Kuwait’s firefighting force, Col. Sayed Hassan Al-Moussawi, said, “In a building like this, you’re supposed to go up to the roof, but unfortunately the door to the roof was locked.” Ramesh, an Indian worker who lives in a building next door and who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said in an interview that he saw people trying to jump out of windows to escape. The fire’s high death toll highlighted the perils faced by low-income immigrants to Gulf countries, who often toil under exploitative contracts and live in overcrowded housing, with regulatory protections that are limited or poorly enforced. Foreigners make up about two-thirds of the population of Kuwait, an oil-rich nation with one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds. Many are low-paid workers from South Asian countries who perform jobs including construction, restaurant service and street cleaning. More than 50 people hurt during the fire were sent to hospitals around Kuwait, with injuries including burns, broken bones from jumping out of the building and carbon monoxide poisoning from smoke inhalation, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. Nine were in critical condition, it said. Many of the workers affected were from India, the country’s embassy in Kuwait said on social media. On Wednesday, India’s ambassador to Kuwait, Adarsh Swaika, visited several hospitals where workers were taken, the embassy said in its posts. In a post on X, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India said that the fire was “saddening” and that the Indian Embassy would monitor the situation closely and work with the authorities “to assist the affected.” In a video published by the Kuwaiti news media, Sheikh Fahad was shown at the location of the fire, questioning an unidentified man about who lived in the building. The man told him that 196 people had lived there. The video cut off after Sheikh Fahad told the authorities to detain the man for questioning. Officials working in the municipality overseeing the area were also suspended from work pending an investigation, Kuwait’s state news agency reported. Building codes in Gulf countries are often laxly put in place, and smoke detectors and fire escapes are not common in residential properties. At the site of the fire on Wednesday afternoon, municipal employees were already putting up notices of violations on nearby buildings, including for partitioning rooms with gypsum board. Mangaf is predominantly inhabited by migrant workers, with apartment blocks housing men from India, Bangladesh and Egypt. Interviewed by The New York Times near the fire location, workers who lived nearby gave varying accounts of the numbers of men typically housed in each room, ranging from three to 12. Jayashankar, the survivor, said that nine people, all Indians, had shared his three-bedroom apartment. The building bore a sign saying it was a workers’ camp for a company called NBTC Group, a contracting firm headquartered in Kuwait with business in construction, industry, logistics and related fields. Phone calls to the company on Wednesday went unanswered, and an employee at the company’s offices said that staff members had been detained by officials that day. Another Indian worker who lived on the second floor of the building said that he and his roommates had survived because they had been out working an overnight shift. The worker, Sami, 45, who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said he had not yet been able to go inside to retrieve his belongings and inspect the damage because the police had closed off entrances to the building. Shahrukh Kha, who is from Bihar, India, said that he had spent all day trying to reach his brother, Kalu, who lived in the building, but that his brother’s phone was off. “We have not gotten any kind of information about whether he is injured or dead,” he said in a phone interview. Kalu Kha, a 30-year-old salesman who works in a fruit and vegetable shop, had been planning to travel home to India next month, his brother said; his wedding date is set for July 22.",least people killed dozen others injured persian gulf country kuwait state news agency said fire broke wednesday building housed score lowincome worker many indian national fire began morning coastal area called mangaf half hour drive center capital kuwait city kuwaiti authority held building owner questioning investigate cause fire try determine whether shortcoming neglect played role state news agency reported authority promised begin campaign tackle building code violation public prosecutor office also planned inspect site interview survivor speaking journalist site fire sheikh fahad yusuf al sabah kuwait deputy prime minister interior minister blamed greed property owner disaster said owner company employing worker would also detained reuters news agency kuwaiti newspaper reported jayashankar indian salesman survived fire said awoke scream around local time roommate opened door fourthfloor apartment found thick black smoke enveloped corridor burning lung said phone interview asking identified first name fear retribution instead trying escape said locked door opened window waited help two roommate left apartment find exit later died said witness told local news outlet fire begun bottom sevenstory building sending smoke billowing upward televised interview official kuwait firefighting force col sayed hassan almoussawi said building like youre supposed go roof unfortunately door roof locked ramesh indian worker life building next door also asked identified first name fear retribution said interview saw people trying jump window escape fire high death toll highlighted peril faced lowincome immigrant gulf country often toil exploitative contract live overcrowded housing regulatory protection limited poorly enforced foreigner make twothirds population kuwait oilrich nation one world largest sovereign wealth fund many lowpaid worker south asian country perform job including construction restaurant service street cleaning people hurt fire sent hospital around kuwait injury including burn broken bone jumping building carbon monoxide poisoning smoke inhalation ministry health said statement nine critical condition said many worker affected india country embassy kuwait said social medium wednesday india ambassador kuwait adarsh swaika visited several hospital worker taken embassy said post post x prime minister narendra modi india said fire saddening indian embassy would monitor situation closely work authority assist affected video published kuwaiti news medium sheikh fahad shown location fire questioning unidentified man lived building man told people lived video cut sheikh fahad told authority detain man questioning official working municipality overseeing area also suspended work pending investigation kuwait state news agency reported building code gulf country often laxly put place smoke detector fire escape common residential property site fire wednesday afternoon municipal employee already putting notice violation nearby building including partitioning room gypsum board mangaf predominantly inhabited migrant worker apartment block housing men india bangladesh egypt interviewed new york time near fire location worker lived nearby gave varying account number men typically housed room ranging three jayashankar survivor said nine people indian shared threebedroom apartment building bore sign saying worker camp company called nbtc group contracting firm headquartered kuwait business construction industry logistics related field phone call company wednesday went unanswered employee company office said staff member detained official day another indian worker lived second floor building said roommate survived working overnight shift worker sami also asked identified first name fear retribution said yet able go inside retrieve belonging inspect damage police closed entrance building shahrukh kha bihar india said spent day trying reach brother kalu lived building brother phone gotten kind information whether injured dead said phone interview kalu kha yearold salesman work fruit vegetable shop planning travel home india next month brother said wedding date set july
nytimes,"At the Ambani Wedding Celebrations, a Dazzling Display of Jewels","June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/fashion/weddings/ambani-jewels.html,"When Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India abruptly changed her country’s constitution in 1971 and abolished the Privy Purse, a government allowance for the country’s former princely rulers, she also moved to nationalize their storied treasuries. Among the maharajahs, nizams and nabobs that once ruled the subcontinent, this set off a frenzy as they scurried to bury the family jewels. For centuries, the rarity, scale and grandeur of Indian jewels was so great that many became iconic objects. Take the Patiala Necklace, a tiered ornament resembling draperies of gems. Designed by Cartier, it featured an astounding 2,930 diamonds and centered on a single rock the size of a walnut. Or consider the Indore Pears, two stupendous and closely matched diamonds owned by Maharajah Yeshwant Rao Holkar II, a glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom was in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Indian princely patronage long set a global standard of splendor for both artistry and ostentation in the jewel trade. Yet in the decades after the Privy Purse, most of the big rocks seemed to have vanished underground. Legend has it that members of formerly royal families stashed their jewels in Swiss vaults, pawned them on the black market or hid them in flower pots. Bling on a royal scale largely disappeared. Or so it seemed until a fresh cadre of princes heaved into view: oligarchs. The richest of these by orders of magnitude is Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of his family’s megacompany Reliance Industries. Mr. Ambani’s personal fortune is estimated by Forbes at a staggering $115 billion. Despite his vast wealth, few outside India had heard of him — that is, until March 1, when he hosted a three-day party to celebrate his son Anant’s wedding in July. Everything about the prewedding affair was on a princely scale: the guest list of 1,000, including boldface names like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump; a glass palace specially constructed in the Ambani’s hometown, Jamnagar, in the western state of Gujarat; and Rihanna’s first public performance in years. Rihanna’s reported $6 million payday hogged the headlines, but what lit up at least one obsessive corner of the internet was the Ambani jewelry. This included necklaces and earrings and rings and hair ornaments of a size and grandeur seldom seen publicly since the days of the Raj. “It was almost like the time of maharajahs 100 years down the line,” said Pramod Kumar, an archivist and a founder of the museum consultancy EKA. He is also keeper of topophilia.india, an erudite Instagram account that is catnip for Indophile aesthetes. Mr. Kumar’s sleuth work traced a possible source of the two most gobsmacking gems seen at the Ambani prewedding celebration: massive step-cut Colombian emeralds roughly the size of Popsicles. Draped one below the other as pendants to a diamond necklace, they were worn one evening by the bridegroom’s mother, Nita Ambani. The bigger one was “of 562 carats,” Mr. Kumar wrote in an Instagram post, adding that the weight of the smaller stone was a mere 303 carats. Whatever their source, those emeralds were just two among many gems on display throughout an event at which the jewels often had greater star power than their wearers. “That emerald necklace was what caught everyone’s attention at first, but it was all almost unfathomable,” said Stellene Volandes, the editor in chief of Town & Country. She noted the scarcity represented by ropes of the rarest natural pearls from the Arabian Sea; necklaces in the heavy, ornate rani haar style studded with diamonds; and headpieces known as maang tikka, made with deep green emeralds from the storied Muzo mines. “You’d be very hard-pressed to find comparables for the sheer size and horsepower” of the jewels at the Ambani prewedding party, said Nico Landrigan, the president of the Verdura jewelry house in New York. “The Indians are a jewelry-obsessed culture in a category all their own. So you can only imagine what the actual wedding will bring out.” Before the wedding, scheduled for July 12 to 14 in Mumbai, there was yet another lavish preparatory celebration and opportunity to flaunt big rocks — a cruise from the Tyrrhenian Sea in Palermo, Italy, to the Mediterranean in Cannes, France, on an ocean liner whose 2,400 staterooms had been retrofitted for the Ambanis as three-bedroom suites for 800 invited guests. “Basically, what the Ambanis are doing is displaying a kind of old-style Hollywood glam,” said Mr. Kumar of EKA. “You don’t see that with any other current billionaire moguls in Europe or America, at least not in the public realm.” For Daniela Mascetti, the former chairwoman of Sotheby’s jewelry division in Europe and an author of “Understanding Jewelry,” a bible of the trade, the group more aptly compared to the Ambanis is the robber barons of the Industrial Age. “You have to look back to Vanderbilt or Gould, who also wanted big door-stoppers,” Ms. Mascetti said from London. “Let’s put it in a nice way,” she added. “If you are new money and you want to display wealth, you go big.” Yet it is not altogether that simple. Certain Ambani jewels were crafted using the whopper stones, but that is not to suggest that the determining factor in commissioning them was size. “There is tremendous artistry in the work,” said Ms. Volandes of Town & Country. Much of the Ambani jewels were designed by Viren Bhagat, among the more refined high jewelers, though also an assiduously private one. More than the size of individual stones like the stepped-cut emeralds, few save a detective like Mr. Kumar could predict their origins. “Being one-off is of the greatest importance in that world,” Francesca Amfitheatrof, the creative director of high jewelry and watches at Louis Vuitton, said recently from St.-Tropez, France, where she was debuting her latest collection. “To be able to source things that are so unique and outstanding, honestly, only an emperor has that possibility anymore,” she said. “It’s completely maharajah-like. It’s imperial.”",prime minister indira gandhi india abruptly changed country constitution abolished privy purse government allowance country former princely ruler also moved nationalize storied treasury among maharajah nizams nabob ruled subcontinent set frenzy scurried bury family jewel century rarity scale grandeur indian jewel great many became iconic object take patiala necklace tiered ornament resembling drapery gem designed cartier featured astounding diamond centered single rock size walnut consider indore pear two stupendous closely matched diamond owned maharajah yeshwant rao holkar ii glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom central indian state madhya pradesh indian princely patronage long set global standard splendor artistry ostentation jewel trade yet decade privy purse big rock seemed vanished underground legend member formerly royal family stashed jewel swiss vault pawned black market hid flower pot bling royal scale largely disappeared seemed fresh cadre prince heaved view oligarch richest order magnitude mukesh ambani chairman family megacompany reliance industry mr ambanis personal fortune estimated forbes staggering billion despite vast wealth outside india heard march hosted threeday party celebrate son anants wedding july everything prewedding affair princely scale guest list including boldface name like mark zuckerberg bill gate ivanka trump glass palace specially constructed ambanis hometown jamnagar western state gujarat rihannas first public performance year rihannas reported million payday hogged headline lit least one obsessive corner internet ambani jewelry included necklace earring ring hair ornament size grandeur seldom seen publicly since day raj almost like time maharajah year line said pramod kumar archivist founder museum consultancy eka also keeper topophiliaindia erudite instagram account catnip indophile aesthete mr kumars sleuth work traced possible source two gobsmacking gem seen ambani prewedding celebration massive stepcut colombian emerald roughly size popsicle draped one pendant diamond necklace worn one evening bridegroom mother nita ambani bigger one carat mr kumar wrote instagram post adding weight smaller stone mere carat whatever source emerald two among many gem display throughout event jewel often greater star power wearer emerald necklace caught everyones attention first almost unfathomable said stellene volandes editor chief town country noted scarcity represented rope rarest natural pearl arabian sea necklace heavy ornate rani haar style studded diamond headpiece known maang tikka made deep green emerald storied muzo mine youd hardpressed find comparables sheer size horsepower jewel ambani prewedding party said nico landrigan president verdura jewelry house new york indian jewelryobsessed culture category imagine actual wedding bring wedding scheduled july mumbai yet another lavish preparatory celebration opportunity flaunt big rock cruise tyrrhenian sea palermo italy mediterranean cannes france ocean liner whose stateroom retrofitted ambanis threebedroom suite invited guest basically ambanis displaying kind oldstyle hollywood glam said mr kumar eka dont see current billionaire mogul europe america least public realm daniela mascetti former chairwoman sothebys jewelry division europe author understanding jewelry bible trade group aptly compared ambanis robber baron industrial age look back vanderbilt gould also wanted big doorstopper m mascetti said london let put nice way added new money want display wealth go big yet altogether simple certain ambani jewel crafted using whopper stone suggest determining factor commissioning size tremendous artistry work said m volandes town country much ambani jewel designed viren bhagat among refined high jeweler though also assiduously private one size individual stone like steppedcut emerald save detective like mr kumar could predict origin oneoff greatest importance world francesca amfitheatrof creative director high jewelry watch louis vuitton said recently sttropez france debuting latest collection able source thing unique outstanding honestly emperor possibility anymore said completely maharajahlike imperial

nytimes,"India-Pakistan Cricket World Cup Match Brings 34,000 Fans to Long Island","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/nyregion/india-pakistan-cricket-world-cup.html,"Normally at this time of year, the grassy southeastern corner of Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, N.Y., is a place for softball games, family picnics and a few cricket players enjoying a warm weekend afternoon. On Sunday, that space was transformed into a stage for one of the most-watched global sporting events of the year. More than 34,000 fans and cricket dignitaries squeezed into a temporary stadium built in the last three months in the Long Island park to watch the most anticipated match of the T20 Cricket World Cup: India versus Pakistan. For about three hours, fans in blue and orange India shirts mingled with their (vastly outnumbered) rivals in the dark green of Pakistan, producing a festive and vibrant atmosphere. They roared at every big play, shouting and waving signs and flags. They ate South Asian food sold at the concession stands, jumped, chanted, high-fived with fellow supporters and — after a bit of rain — soaked up the sunshine on a historic day at the usually quiet park. “It was electric,” said Chandu Talla, an India fan and entrepreneur from Tampa, Fla., who came to the match with his son Aryan, a high school junior. “We paid $2,500 per ticket and no regrets,” he added. “It was a dream come true to see India here.” After a slow start, India came back strong to win, and when Pakistan’s Naseem Shah hit the last ball from India bowler Arshdeep Singh, the India fans erupted in cheers. “It was pretty good,” said India bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who was named the player of the match. “Always, when India and Pakistan play, a lot of emotion does come in. It did feel like we had a lot of support.” People in the New York area may have been mostly oblivious to it, but any match between India and Pakistan, two of the greatest cricketing nations, is a monumental event, at least in South Asia and other cricket-loving parts of the world. The previous time the teams played, last fall, viewership reached 398 million in India alone, according to the International Cricket Council. (This year’s Super Bowl had 123 million viewers.) Sunday’s attendance (34,028) constituted the largest at an international cricket match in the United States, according to the I.C.C. Attendees included such cricketing legends as Yuvraj Singh of India, Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi and Australia’s Ricky Ponting. For Omar Minaya, the Yankees’ special adviser and the former general manager of the Mets, the cricket match was his first. “It’s amazing,” he said. “The atmosphere is great. It’s like the World Baseball Classic, or the Dominican Baseball League.” The T20 World Cup, held every two years, is a 20-nation tournament featuring a shorter form of cricket. This year, for the first time, the event is being held in the United States and several Caribbean nations where cricket is revered. The U.S. matches are also being held in Dallas and Lauderhill, Fla., but New York was designated for the marquee matchup. Cricket is part of the cultural fabric in both India and Pakistan, but political tensions over the decades have forced the countries to play each other in other places. “Oh, it’s contentious, a real battle of sentiments,” said Narinder Kapoor, 84, a retired U.S. Treasury Department agent, originally from New Delhi. “When these countries play, it’s a real hot potato.” A former amateur cricket player who emigrated to Syosset, N.Y., in 1972, Mr. Kapoor had not seen a cricket match live since 1974, although he watches the sport constantly on TV. He went to the game between Ireland and Canada on Friday and had hoped to attend Sunday’s big encounter, but his knees were ailing him, so he stayed home, according to his son, Sandeep Kapoor. The elder Mr. Kapoor said that he enjoyed the sparsely attended match on Friday, but added that the temporary stadium did not have enough accommodations for people with disabilities and that it was difficult for older people to ascend the steps. “But once you are inside, the field and the view is excellent,” he said. “World class.” Security was tight for the match, especially after a website purportedly affiliated with the terrorist organization ISIS called for attacks on the event. Mounted police, SWAT units, sniffer dogs, helicopters and large numbers of police officers swarmed the area, and long lines formed at entrances as people went through security scanners. Bruce Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, said that the I.C.C. had defrayed some of the cost of the security, which he said included local, state and federal agencies, including the F.B.I. “I want to commend the fans,” Mr. Blakeman said, adding, “Everybody has been so polite and respectful, and they followed instructions so they could be safe and healthy.” There was at least one exception. An airplane trailing a sign that said “Release Imran Khan” breached restricted airspace over the stadium before the match. (Mr. Khan, a former Pakistani cricket star and former prime minister of Pakistan, is serving a prison sentence there.) Mr. Blakeman said the plane was eventually intercepted. The mood at the park was generally upbeat, even for Pakistan fans on the losing end. “India-Pakistan is a very big deal,” said Temu Martin, an airfreight transport official from New Jersey and a Pakistan supporter. “But it’s not war. It’s a game.” He said that after Pakistan lost to the United States last week in a major upset in Dallas, ticket prices for Sunday’s match in East Meadow plummeted from over $2,000 to $600. He said he was planning to travel to Barbados for Pakistan’s next match and then to attend a knockout-stage match in Antigua. There are three more matches scheduled in New York, with the final one on Wednesday between India and the United States. The stadium will then be dismantled and the pieces sent out to other sporting events around the country. Mr. Blakeman predicted that Nassau County would make $150 million on the eight New York games of the tournament — 10 times what the county spent on infrastructure, planning and security, he said. Cricket officials had told him that there could be as many as 600 million viewers worldwide for Sunday’s match, he added. He said that he had heard from investors who want to bring the sport, perhaps with New York’s franchise in Major League Cricket, to Nassau County. “The way things have gone here these last couple of weeks, I think cricket has found a home,” Mr. Blakeman said.",normally time year grassy southeastern corner eisenhower park east meadow ny place softball game family picnic cricket player enjoying warm weekend afternoon sunday space transformed stage one mostwatched global sporting event year fan cricket dignitary squeezed temporary stadium built last three month long island park watch anticipated match cricket world cup india versus pakistan three hour fan blue orange india shirt mingled vastly outnumbered rival dark green pakistan producing festive vibrant atmosphere roared every big play shouting waving sign flag ate south asian food sold concession stand jumped chanted highfived fellow supporter bit rain soaked sunshine historic day usually quiet park electric said chandu talla india fan entrepreneur tampa fla came match son aryan high school junior paid per ticket regret added dream come true see india slow start india came back strong win pakistan naseem shah hit last ball india bowler arshdeep singh india fan erupted cheer pretty good said india bowler jasprit bumrah named player match always india pakistan play lot emotion come feel like lot support people new york area may mostly oblivious match india pakistan two greatest cricketing nation monumental event least south asia cricketloving part world previous time team played last fall viewership reached million india alone according international cricket council year super bowl million viewer sunday attendance constituted largest international cricket match united state according icc attendee included cricketing legend yuvraj singh india pakistan shahid afridi australia ricky ponting omar minaya yankee special adviser former general manager mets cricket match first amazing said atmosphere great like world baseball classic dominican baseball league world cup held every two year nation tournament featuring shorter form cricket year first time event held united state several caribbean nation cricket revered u match also held dallas lauderhill fla new york designated marquee matchup cricket part cultural fabric india pakistan political tension decade forced country play place oh contentious real battle sentiment said narinder kapoor retired u treasury department agent originally new delhi country play real hot potato former amateur cricket player emigrated syosset ny mr kapoor seen cricket match live since although watch sport constantly tv went game ireland canada friday hoped attend sunday big encounter knee ailing stayed home according son sandeep kapoor elder mr kapoor said enjoyed sparsely attended match friday added temporary stadium enough accommodation people disability difficult older people ascend step inside field view excellent said world class security tight match especially website purportedly affiliated terrorist organization isi called attack event mounted police swat unit sniffer dog helicopter large number police officer swarmed area long line formed entrance people went security scanner bruce blakeman nassau county executive said icc defrayed cost security said included local state federal agency including fbi want commend fan mr blakeman said adding everybody polite respectful followed instruction could safe healthy least one exception airplane trailing sign said release imran khan breached restricted airspace stadium match mr khan former pakistani cricket star former prime minister pakistan serving prison sentence mr blakeman said plane eventually intercepted mood park generally upbeat even pakistan fan losing end indiapakistan big deal said temu martin airfreight transport official new jersey pakistan supporter war game said pakistan lost united state last week major upset dallas ticket price sunday match east meadow plummeted said planning travel barbados pakistan next match attend knockoutstage match antigua three match scheduled new york final one wednesday india united state stadium dismantled piece sent sporting event around country mr blakeman predicted nassau county would make million eight new york game tournament time county spent infrastructure planning security said cricket official told could many million viewer worldwide sunday match added said heard investor want bring sport perhaps new york franchise major league cricket nassau county way thing gone last couple week think cricket found home mr blakeman said
nytimes,"Modi, Striking a Modest Tone, Is Sworn In for a Third Term","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/world/asia/india-changed-modi-swearing-in.html,"As a humbled Narendra Modi was sworn in on Sunday for a third term as India’s prime minister, the political air in New Delhi appeared transformed. The election that ended last week stripped Mr. Modi of his parliamentary majority and forced him to turn to a diverse set of coalition partners to stay in power. Now, these other parties are enjoying something that for years was singularly Mr. Modi’s: relevance and the spotlight. Their leaders have been swarmed by TV crews while on their way to present demands and policy opinions to Mr. Modi. His opponents, too, have been getting more airtime, with stations cutting live to their news conferences, something almost unheard-of in recent years. Above all, the change can be seen in Mr. Modi himself. For now, at least, the messianic air is gone. He pitches himself as the modest administrator that voters showed they wanted. “To run the government, a majority is necessary. But to run the nation, a consensus is necessary,” Mr. Modi said in a speech on Friday to members of his coalition ahead of his swearing in. “The people want us to deliver better than before.” A visibly emotional Mr. Modi took the oath of office on Sunday evening, only the second prime minister to be elected for a third consecutive term in the seven decades of India’s republic. The ceremony, at the country’s presidential palace, was attended by about 8,000 supporters and dignitaries, including the leaders of India’s neighboring nations. To many, Mr. Modi’s shift in approach can mean only good things for the country’s democracy — a move toward moderation in a hugely diverse nation that was being whipped into a Hindu-first monolith in the image of one man. The question is whether Mr. Modi can truly become something he has not been during his two-plus decades in elected office: a consensus builder. “He is a pragmatic politician and, for his own survival and for the survival of his party, he will be a little mellowed,” said Ashutosh, a New Delhi-based analyst who uses only one name and is the author of a book on how Indian politics have changed under Mr. Modi. “But to assume a qualitative change in his style of governance is expecting too much.” A trademark of Mr. Modi’s leadership in recent years has been the use of power levers at his disposal — from pressure of police cases to the lure of a share in power and its perks — to break his opponents and get them to switch to his side. A bruised governing party may well try such tactics to peel away some lawmakers to his side, analyst say, to buttress his place at the top. But in the days leading up to the swearing-in, a change in approach was evident. When members of the new coalition packed into the hall of India’s old Parliament building on Friday for deliberations on forming the government, every time a senior ally seated next to him stood up to start his speech, Mr. Modi also stood up. When it was time for Mr. Modi to be garlanded as the coalition’s choice for prime minister, he waited for the leaders of the two main coalition partners to arrive by his side before the congratulatory wreath of purple orchids was placed around his neck. His hourlong address contained none of his usual references to himself in the third person. His tone was measured. He focused on the coalition’s promise of “good governance” and “the dream of a developed India,” and he acknowledged that things would be different from the past 10 years. The last time Mr. Modi came to the Parliament complex for a closely watched event, last May when he inaugurated a new, more modern building for the assembly, he made an entrance some observers compared with that of a king: with markings on his forehead as a sign of piety and a scepter in his hand, as shirtless, chanting Hindu monks walked ahead of and behind him. This time, he went straight to a copy of the Constitution, which declares that India is a secular and socialist democracy, bowing before it and lifting it to his forehead. For the first time in his more than two decades in elected office, Mr. Modi finds himself in uncharted territory. Until now, as long as he has been at the helm — whether at the state level as the chief minister of Gujarat or at the national level — his Bharatiya Janata Party has always had a majority. Analysts say that history of never having been in the opposition has shaped his heavy-handed approach to politics. When he left Gujarat, after 13 years, he had established such a firm grip and had so routed the opposition that the state had effectively become one of single-party rule. His first national victory in 2014, with a majority for his B.J.P., ended decades of coalition governance in India, in which no party had been able to capture the 272 seats in Parliament necessary for a majority. In 2019, he was re-elected with an even bigger majority. Mr. Modi’s enormous power helped swiftly carry out what had for decades been his right-wing party’s agenda, including construction of a lavish Hindu temple on a long-disputed site that once held a mosque, and the revocation of the special status long enjoyed by the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir. A separatist insurgency has long troubled the Himalayan Kashmir region. As the inauguration ceremony began in New Delhi on Sunday, a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims in the Reasi district fell into a gorge after gunmen opened fire on it. At least eight people were killed, the police said. A trademark of Mr. Modi’s governance was a disregard for parliamentary procedures and for debates on legislation. His unexpected, overnight demonetization in 2016 — which invalidated India’s currency in an effort to crack down on corruption — threw the country into chaos and dealt a blow to a still cash-driven economy. Similarly, rushing to enact laws aimed at overhauling the agriculture market resulted in a year of protests that choked Delhi, forcing Mr. Modi to retreat. Before the election results came out, Mr. Modi’s party had predicted that his coalition would win 400 seats in India’s 543-seat Parliament. The opposition would be reduced to sitting “in the spectators’ gallery,” Mr. Modi said. Officials in his government had made clear that in his new term he would seek to put in place the only main item remaining on his party’s agenda: legislating a “uniform civil code” across this diverse country to replace varying laws of different religions that currently govern issues like marriage and inheritance. His party leaders spoke of Mr. Modi not only as their leader for the current term, but also for the next election in 2029, when he would be 78. “He has been trying to transform the country,” Sudesh Verma, a B.J.P. official who wrote a book on Mr. Modi’s rise, said in an interview before the election results were announced. “I look forward to him working like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, who worked into his 90s.” But under a coalition government, Mr. Modi’s traditional approach will be difficult. Two of the main coalition parties that helped him achieve the minimum number of Parliament seats to form a government are secular, in contrast to Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist ideology. N. Chandrababu Naidu, whose party holds 16 seats, has been scathing in the past in his criticism of Mr. Modi’s treatment of the Muslim minority. He has also openly criticized Mr. Modi for using the central investigating agencies to target his opponents and taking “steps to subvert all democratic institutions.” Neerja Chowdhury, a political analyst in Delhi and the author of the 2023 book “How Prime Ministers Decide,” said, “The contentious ideological issues, like the enactment of the uniform civil code, may be put on the back burner if the allies are not comfortable with it.” Mr. Modi’s popular image is built on two strong pillars. He is a champion of economic development, with an inspiring biography of a rise from a humble caste and relative poverty. He is also a lifelong Hindu nationalist, with decades as a foot soldier in a movement seeking to turn India’s secular and diverse state into an overtly Hindu-first place. At the peak of his power, the Hindu nationalist aspect increasingly dominated. Analysts say that the recent rebuke by voters might be a lucky break for the nation: prompting Mr. Modi to tap into his development champion side, and to focus on a legacy of economic transformation that could improve the lives of all Indians.",humbled narendra modi sworn sunday third term india prime minister political air new delhi appeared transformed election ended last week stripped mr modi

nytimes,"India’s Modi, Humbled by Voters, Faces Potent Economic Struggles","June 7, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/business/india-election-modi-economy.html,"Before the Indian election results emerged this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was widely viewed as a charismatic and popular strongman celebrated by the business world for elevating its importance, even as he failed to solve a vexing problem: how to turn swift economic growth into critically needed jobs. After the election, Mr. Modi finds himself staring at that same monumental puzzle, yet relegated to an uncomfortable new status. He is the head of a party that has been chastened at the polls, forcing him to forge a coalition to maintain power. Mr. Modi’s governing authority is likely to be constrained by the complexities of keeping his coalition partners on his side. He could not solve India’s most deep-seated economic challenge when he wielded a monopolistic hold on power. Now, he is a weakened leader who must balance additional interests, while still lacking an obvious way to improve living standards. “There has been a sense that employment growth has been weak in the last four, five years,” said Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic adviser to the Modi administration, who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “How do you create more jobs? This is really India’s central economic challenge, but I think the government will find itself with relatively limited tools.” The humbling of Mr. Modi’s party resonates in part as an expression of popular frustration that India remains a land of economic peril for hundreds of millions of people, as well as a country defined by astonishing contrasts in wealth. In major cities, five-star hotels boasting sumptuous spas look down on teeming slums that lack plumbing. In rural areas, malnutrition prevails under many roofs, and families struggle to find the money to keep children in school.",indian election result emerged week prime minister narendra modi widely viewed charismatic popular strongman celebrated business world elevating importance even failed solve vexing problem turn swift economic growth critically needed job election mr modi find staring monumental puzzle yet relegated uncomfortable new status head party chastened poll forcing forge coalition maintain power mr modis governing authority likely constrained complexity keeping coalition partner side could solve india deepseated economic challenge wielded monopolistic hold power weakened leader must balance additional interest still lacking obvious way improve living standard sense employment growth weak last four five year said arvind subramanian former chief economic adviser modi administration senior fellow peterson institute international economics washington create job really india central economic challenge think government find relatively limited tool humbling mr modis party resonates part expression popular frustration india remains land economic peril hundred million people well country defined astonishing contrast wealth major city fivestar hotel boasting sumptuous spa look teeming slum lack plumbing rural area malnutrition prevails many roof family struggle find money keep child school
nytimes,The World Heads to the Polls,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/climate/global-elections-climate-change-policy.html,"One of the busiest election cycles in history is coming to an end on Sunday. Hundreds of millions of people have gone to the polls in South Africa, India and Mexico in recent days, and millions more will do the same in the European Union this weekend. As Somini Sengupta has explained in a series of articles this week, among the issues that the new leaders of these countries will face: how to transition away from coal, how to adapt to record-breaking heat and, in Europe’s case, how to address a growing backlash against environmental policies. Today, I want to lay out some the most pressing environmental challenges in these areas, and what the results announced in the past few days point to. Keep in mind that whatever happens in the United States election in November will affect many of these countries, too. The biggest takeaway from India’s elections, as my colleagues who cover the country put it, is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “lost his aura of invincibility.” His Bharatiya Janata Party still won far more seats than any other party, and Modi is set to take up his third consecutive term as prime minister. But his party didn’t win an outright majority and now needs coalition partners to stay in power. Many critics of the current government see the result as good news for democracy, because Modi will be forced to seek support from more moderate allies. It could also bring some relief to activists like Ritwick Dutta, an environmental lawyer whose efforts to defend nature in India have made him a target of the government. But it’s unclear how fewer seats in Parliament will affect Modi’s environmental policies. The main challenges facing the next Indian government are what to do about the effects of climate change, including heat waves that have killed dozens of people. During the elections, at least 33 poll workers were among them, and the heat also closed schools in several states,",one busiest election cycle history coming end sunday hundred million people gone poll south africa india mexico recent day million european union weekend somini sengupta explained series article week among issue new leader country face transition away coal adapt recordbreaking heat europe case address growing backlash environmental policy today want lay pressing environmental challenge area result announced past day point keep mind whatever happens united state election november affect many country biggest takeaway india election colleague cover country put prime minister narendra modi lost aura invincibility bharatiya janata party still far seat party modi set take third consecutive term prime minister party didnt win outright majority need coalition partner stay power many critic current government see result good news democracy modi forced seek support moderate ally could also bring relief activist like ritwick dutta environmental lawyer whose effort defend nature india made target government unclear fewer seat parliament affect modis environmental policy main challenge facing next indian government effect climate change including heat wave killed dozen people election least poll worker among heat also closed school several state
nytimes,Narendra Modi’s India,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/briefing/modis-india.html,"Narendra Modi has just won re-election as India’s prime minister, though by a far narrower margin than expected. With his third consecutive term, the charismatic strongman has still sealed his position as the country’s most significant leader in generations. Despite having led India for a decade, Modi has in some ways kept his country guessing about his vision. On major issues — India’s relationships, its economy, its society and its government — it’s still unclear what sort of country Modi wants India to be. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain four of the big questions. India has spent recent years deepening its relationship with the United States. It has gotten closer to American allies, including Japan and Australia, and ordered high-end American weapons systems — the kind that create dependence down the road. And it is unlikely to side with China. In 2020, Chinese troops crossed into territory controlled by India and killed 20 soldiers in a skirmish. Modi has kept Beijing at arm’s length since then. But Modi, 73, has signaled that he doesn’t want to be a U.S. ally. Some officials in his inner circle still regard the United States warily. American diplomats complain about New Delhi’s apparent efforts to erode democratic norms and the rights of minority groups. So India keeps its options open. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States tried in vain to persuade India to take a stand against the war. India still processes Russian oil (picking up the slack created by international sanctions). It still buys weapons from Russia. India spent the Cold War trying to position itself as a nonaligned power. Old habits die hard. India recently overtook China as the most populous country and the fastest-growing large economy. Still, most of the country remains poor. Some 800 million people need help filling their stomachs. Modi’s ideas about how to help them can be contradictory — they’re both globally minded and protectionist.",narendra modi reelection india prime minister though far narrower margin expected third consecutive term charismatic strongman still sealed position country significant leader generation despite led india decade modi way kept country guessing vision major issue india relationship economy society government still unclear sort country modi want india today newsletter ill explain four big question india spent recent year deepening relationship united state gotten closer american ally including japan australia ordered highend american weapon system kind create dependence road unlikely side china chinese troop crossed territory controlled india killed soldier skirmish modi kept beijing arm length since modi signaled doesnt want u ally official inner circle still regard united state warily american diplomat complain new delhi apparent effort erode democratic norm right minority group india keep option open russia invaded ukraine united state tried vain persuade india take stand war india still process russian oil picking slack created international sanction still buy weapon russia india spent cold war trying position nonaligned power old habit die hard india recently overtook china populous country fastestgrowing large economy still country remains poor million people need help filling stomach modis idea help contradictory theyre globally minded protectionist
nytimes,"In Global Elections, Strongmen Are Taken Down a Notch","June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/world/global-elections-india-turkey-democracy.html,"In India, a powerful leader wins another term but sees his party’s majority vanish. In South Africa, the governing party is humbled by voters for the first time since the end of apartheid. In Britain, a populist insurgent barges into an election that is shaping up to be a crushing defeat for the long-ruling Conservatives. If there is a common thread halfway through this global year of elections, it is a desire by voters to send a strong signal to the powers that be — if not quite a wholesale housecleaning, then a defiant shake-up of the status quo. Even in Mexico, where Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and the handpicked successor of the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was elected in a landslide last Sunday, voters were rewarding the forces that had uprooted the country’s entrenched establishment only six years earlier. With a billion-plus people going to the polls in more than 60 countries, some analysts had feared that 2024 would pose a fateful test for democracy — one that it might fail. For years, populist and strongmen leaders have chipped away at democratic institutions, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of elections, while social media has swamped voters with disinformation and conspiracy theories. In some of the biggest, most fragile democracies, leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey had been regarded as close to invincible, using appeals to nationalism or sectarianism to mobilize supporters and bending institutions to suit their purposes. Yet now, Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan have both had their wings clipped. Soaring inflation, chronic unemployment and uneven economic growth have widened inequality in India, Turkey and elsewhere, frustrating voters who have shown a willingness to buck the establishment. “We do have electoral systems that are producing outcomes the governing parties didn’t want,” said Ben Ansell, a professor of comparative democratic institutions at the University of Oxford. “They’ve all been destabilized by a tricky economic environment, and behaving like strongmen hasn’t saved them.” Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan remain in power, each now in his third term. But Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., lost dozens of seats and will have to govern in a coalition with two secular parties. Turkey’s opposition struck a blow against Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party in April, winning a string of local elections and solidifying its control of important cities like Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. “In a lot of countries where there’s been talk of backsliding, that’s where we’ve seen a bounce back,” Professor Ansell said. “For Modi and Erdogan, taking the sheen off their infallibility was very important.” With so many elections in so many countries, it is dangerous to generalize. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia rolled up 88 percent of the vote in a landslide re-election victory in March that spoke less to Russian public sentiment and more to the ability of an autocrat, facing no meaningful opposition, to stage-manage a show of support for his war in Ukraine. In Europe, far-right parties are expected to perform well in European Parliament elections, which began on Thursday. Analysts said they did not believe this would jeopardize the political center that has governed Europe in the post-World War II era. And Poland provided a source of reassurance last fall, when voters pushed out its nationalist Law and Justice Party in favor of a more liberal opposition. Still, the success of far-right figures like Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy, attests to the enduring appeal of populism. “Populists and right-wingers will continue to make gains and strike fear into the European political establishment,” the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said in its analysis of the top risks of 2024. Britain’s general election was shaken up on Monday when Nigel Farage, a populist politician, pro-Brexit campaigner and ally of former President Donald J. Trump, announced he would run for a seat in Parliament under the banner of his Reform U.K. party, which has a strident anti-immigration message. That will add to the headache for the Conservative Party, which has lagged the opposition Labour Party by double digits in polls for nearly 18 months. Reform, which is fielding candidates across the country, could siphon off Conservative votes among those who blame the party for a weak economy and rising immigration numbers since Britain left the European Union in 2020. Some critics argue that the Conservative Party’s problems stem from its free-market policies, which they say have disillusioned voters in disadvantaged parts of Britain and set it apart from right-wing parties in Europe or Mr. Trump’s Make America Great Again movement in the United States. More fundamentally, though, the Conservatives have been in power for 14 years, and they face the same pent-up dissatisfaction with the status quo that fueled the recent elections in India, South Africa and Turkey. In some countries, the urge to break with the past has led voters to make unorthodox choices: Javier Milei, a flamboyant libertarian economist, swept to power in Argentina last November with a promise to close its central bank and wage an all-out assault on what he described as a corrupt political “caste.” Some analysts argue that similarly disruptive forces are driving the presidential race in the United States, where a comparatively healthy economy and the advantages of incumbency have not spared President Biden, who faces a neck-and-neck challenge from Mr. Trump even after the former president was convicted of multiple felonies. “It’s not about left versus right, it’s about the status quo versus change,” said Frank Luntz, an American political strategist who has lived and worked in Britain. “You can’t buy a house in the U.K., the N.H.S. doesn’t work,” he said, referring to the National Health Service. “In the United States, you can’t afford housing or health care. It’s about broken promises, year after year after year.” That sense of betrayal is even more acute in countries like South Africa, where the African National Congress, or A.N.C., has governed since the start of democracy there in 1994, piling up majorities even as the economy and social infrastructure crumbled. Last week, voters finally rebelled, driving down the A.N.C.’s vote share to 40 percent, from 58 percent in the last national election in 2019. Among their biggest complaints is the lack of job opportunities: South Africa’s unemployment rate — at 42 percent, including those who have stopped looking for work — is one of the highest in the world. Stagnation has widened the country’s already profound inequality. South Africans flock to cities looking for work. But many end up in decrepit buildings and slapdash shack communities, often without running water or sanitary toilets. Regular power outages leave streets dark and residents of many communities vulnerable to crime. South Africa’s murder rate is six and a half times as high as that of the United States and 45 times as high as Germany’s. Jacob Zuma, the scandal-scarred former president, has benefited from this misery, helping start a new party, umKhonto weSizwe, or M.K., which won nearly 15 percent of the vote, mostly at the expense of his former party, the A.N.C. Mr. Zuma attracts a feverish following among disillusioned A.N.C. supporters, who accuse the party of selling out to wealthy white businesspeople and not moving aggressively enough to redistribute wealth to the Black majority after apartheid. India’s election was a comparable anti-incumbent revolt, even if Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. is still the largest party in Parliament by a wide margin. The party’s campaign spending was at least 20 times as much as that of its main opposition, the Congress Party, which had its bank accounts frozen by the government in a tax dispute on the eve of the election. The country’s news outlets have been largely bought off or bullied into silence. And yet, the results showed Mr. Modi, 73, losing his majority for the first time since he took office in 2014. Analysts said that reflected widespread dissatisfaction with how the fruits of India’s economy have been shared. While India’s steady growth has made it the envy of its neighbors — and created a conspicuous billionaire class — those riches have not flowed to the hundreds of millions of India’s poor. The government has handed out free rations of wheat, grain and cooking gas. It offers home water connections, subsidizes building supplies and gives farmers cash. But it has not tackled India’s inflation or unemployment, leaving hundreds of millions of people, especially women, chronically out of work. There is also some evidence that Mr. Modi’s appeals to Hindu nationalism were not as potent as in previous elections. The B.J.P.’s candidate did not even win the constituency that is home to the lavish Ram temple, built on grounds disputed by Hindus and Muslims. Mr. Modi inaugurated the temple just before the campaign started, hoping it would galvanize his Hindu political base. The economy figured into Mexico’s election as well, but in a very different way. While overall growth was disappointing — averaging only 1 percent a year during Mr. López Obrador’s term — the government doubled the minimum wage and strengthened the peso, lifting millions of Mexicans out of poverty. “People vote with their wallets, and it’s very obvious there’s more money in the wallets of almost everybody in Mexico,” said Diego Casteñeda Garza, a Mexican economist and historian at Uppsala University in Sweden. Still, analysts said, there was also a desire among voters to cement the change that Mr. López Obrador, a charismatic outsider, symbolized when he came to power in 2018. Even as Ms. Sheinbaum, 61, vowed to continue her mentor’s policies, she cast herself — Mexico’s first female and Jewish president — as a change agent. For Jacqueline González, 33, who works at a cargo transportation company and viewed Mexico’s previous governments as corrupt, that made voting for Ms. Sheinbaum an easy decision. “With Obrador we have already seen, although some people don’t want to admit it, some change,” Ms. González said. “Let’s hope it continues with Sheinbaum.”",india powerful leader win another term see party majority vanish

nytimes,"Rahul Gandhi, Long on the Ropes, Looks Set for an Unexpected Comeback","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-congress-rahul-gandhi.html,"Just last year, Rahul Gandhi and the once-powerful party he led, the Indian National Congress, seemed to be on the ropes and little threat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s consolidation of political power. Congress had not been a competitive factor in national elections in years, winning fewer and fewer votes each time Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party was elected. And Mr. Gandhi himself had been convicted on a slander charge and barred from holding a seat in Parliament. But on Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi and a broad opposition coalition led by his Congress party registered a far stronger showing than expected in India’s elections, setting the stage for an unlikely comeback. “He has finally arrived,” said Rasheed Kidwai, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi. “This time he has improved his vote share by at least 17 million votes, which is very substantial.” On Wednesday, Mr. Modi’s party announced that it had reached an agreement to form a governing coalition, including two parties that do not necessarily share its vision. Congress won 99 seats in the 543-seat Parliament, a gain of 47 seats, and the alliance of which it is the leading part won a total of 232. Congress and its alliance of over two dozen political groups have presented the results as a “moral victory” over a B.J.P. government that they say was trying to change the country’s Constitution and have portrayed as anathema to India’s identity as a multifaith and secular country. “The fight was to save the Constitution,” Mr. Gandhi, the son, grandson and great-grandson of Congress prime ministers, said as the results poured in. The first major sign that Congress might be able to contend came in May 2023, just a couple of months after Mr. Gandhi’s conviction for slander, when his party won the state government of Karnataka, in the south of India, from the B.J.P. The lift was temporary; Congress soon lost power in three states it governed to the B.J.P. But at the same time, political experts say, Mr. Gandhi was pushing for changes within the party, India’s oldest, which had long resisted overhauling an archaic organizational structure that kept its top leaders isolated from the grass-roots workers who deliver votes. Feelings that Congress’s leaders were corrupt and out of touch resulted in a string of defeats over a number of years and then degenerated into messy infighting within the party. For the past two years, party members say, Mr. Gandhi has tried to reverse the decline of Congress by surrounding himself with young policy analysts to help him understand the challenges facing India, as well as party veterans with their ears to the ground in towns and villages that Congress was targeting. The party has in addition improved its social media game, trumpeting its messages on platforms like WhatsApp and YouTube. Mr. Gandhi also raised his profile by embarking on two walks across India — meeting farmers in their fields and vegetable sellers on city streets; and drinking tea with recent graduates and gig workers — in an effort to show common cause with ordinary people. Perhaps most important, Congress focused on a strategy of reaching out to and cooperating with key regional players across the country whose influence had dimmed under B.J.P. rule. Congress leaders made a series of “seat-sharing” agreements with regional leaders, big and small, that strengthened the alliance against Mr. Modi’s party. To avoid splitting the anti-B.J.P. vote, Congress had its own candidates contest fewer seats. And Mr. Gandhi campaigned vigorously alongside the leaders of like-minded political groups across India. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Gandhi also won support, party leaders say, by characterizing Mr. Modi as a leader who would destroy India’s secular character. “It is a victory not just for him and our alliance partners but for the millions of poor Indians who voted to protect the secular fabric of this country,” said Srinivas B.V., another Congress leader, about Mr. Gandhi. “People showed Modi: ‘You are not God, and you can be replaced.’” Since being voted to power in 2014, Mr. Modi has sought to position Hinduism, the religion of some 80 percent of Indians, at the center of the country’s official identity. He also promised to end corruption, overhaul the economy and help India become a “developed nation” by 2047. But after his re-election in 2019, he leaned into Hindu themes to a greater extent. Mr. Gandhi’s efforts to contrast his vision for India with Mr. Modi’s largely paid off, analysts say, even if some members of his party jumped ship and sided with the B.J.P. Many of the politicians who defected from Congress to the B.J.P. lost their seats, including in West Bengal and Maharashtra, where Congress and its partners did especially well. Throughout the campaign Mr. Gandhi persistently linked Mr. Modi with Gautam Adani, Asia’s richest man, saying the prime minister was working for his tycoon friends, not for the vast majority of Indians who are poor. As if to vindicate this line of attack, over the two days after the election results were announced, the price of Mr. Adani’s flagship stock fell by 14 percent. (It then recovered somewhat on Wednesday.) “People directly correlate Adani Ji with Modi Ji — directly,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters after the results, using Hindi honorifics for the two men. Researchers who traveled across India during the voting said Mr. Gandhi had beaten Mr. Modi on his own turf in many places by focusing on issues like the millions of Indians without jobs and the economic difficulties faced by farmers. He also accused the B.J.P. of governance failures and worked with local political groups fighting for social justice and for the empowerment of lower-caste Indians. Uttar Pradesh, where Mr. Modi made dozens of visits to campaign for local candidates, is one state where the changing fortunes of the two largest political groupings was evident. The state is India’s largest, and accounts for 80 of the Parliament’s 543 seats. The B.J.P. recorded its worst performance there since 2009, in part because Mr. Gandhi was able to craft an alliance with a powerful local leader, Akhilesh Yadav. In addition to the 37 seats picked up by Mr. Yadav’s Samajwadi Party, Congress won six, helped by aggressive campaigning by Mr. Gandhi’s sister, Priyanka Vadra, who helped defeat a former soap-opera actress who had served as a minister in Mr. Modi’s government. The B.J.P. won 33 seats, down from 62 in the previous Parliament. The election results announced on Wednesday have given a major lift to hundreds of thousands of Congress workers across the country, who were growing tired of the internal infighting that has plagued their party for years. Outside Congress headquarters in New Delhi, Bansi Lal Meena, a veteran Congress member from the state of Rajasthan, was exultant about his party’s performance. “In villages and on the ground, the B.J.P. spread lies for years against us — saying that we are anti-Hindu,” he said. “They used my religion as a weapon against me to win votes.” He added: “We will show them now because our people are also in Parliament.”",last year rahul gandhi oncepowerful party led indian national congress seemed rope little threat prime minister narendra modis consolidation political power congress competitive

nytimes,Narendra Modi Fell to Earth After Making It All About Himself,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-election-modi.html,"When everything became about Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, his party and its century-old Hindu-nationalist network were propelled to unimagined heights. On the back of his singular charisma and political skill, a onetime-fringe religious ideology was pulled to the center of Indian life. Landslide election victories remade India’s politics, once dominated by diverse coalitions representing a nation that had shaped its independence on secular principles. But there were always risks in wrapping a party’s fortunes so completely in the image of one man, in inundating a country of many religions, castes and cultures with that leader’s name, face and voice. Voters could start to think that everything was about him, not them. They could even revolt. On Tuesday, Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., fell back to earth. After having promised their biggest election romp yet, they lost more than 60 seats. Mr. Modi will remain in office for a third term, but only with the help of a contentious coalition of parties, some of which are opposed to his core beliefs and want power of their own. With the result, India’s strained democracy appeared to roar back to life, its beaten-down political opposition reinvigorated. And after a decade in which Mr. Modi’s success in entrenching Hindu supremacy had often felt like the new common sense, India is seeing its leader and itself in a new light, and trying to understand this unexpected turn. Most fundamentally, the opposition, newly coalesced for what it called a do-or-die moment as Mr. Modi increasingly tilted the playing field, found a way to use the cult of personality around him to its advantage. Opposition leaders focused on bread-and-butter issues, often at granular levels in particular constituencies. They hammered Mr. Modi over persistent unemployment and stark inequality. But the B.J.P., with Mr. Modi from on high its only spokesman, was often left with just one answer: Trust in “Modi’s guarantee.” “The ‘Modi’s guarantee’ slogan turned out to be our undoing,” said Ajay Singh Gaur, a B.J.P. worker who had campaigned in the party stronghold of Uttar Pradesh, the northern state where Mr. Modi suffered his biggest blow on Tuesday, losing nearly half of the B.J.P. seats. “The opposition made that sound like this was not about him having delivered, or trying to deliver,” Mr. Gaur said, “but about him being an arrogant politician.” Mr. Modi gave his adversaries a lot to work with, even declaring that he may not be “biological” and that he had been sent by God. He has still emerged better so far than other Indian leaders who deeply centralized power. He remains in control of levers of power that could help him and his party restore their dominance. Indira Gandhi, who had also glorified herself and went so far as to suspend India’s democracy after declaring a national emergency, was voted out at the peak of her powers before returning three years later. But Mr. Modi’s B.J.P., the world’s largest political party, finds itself in a tough spot after years of centralization and reliance on a government machinery put to the service of one man, analysts say. The huge advantage the party has built in numbers and resources is undercut by a lack of internal consultation and delegation of authority. That was a key reason for its failure in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, with 240 million people, and surrounding states. Local B.J.P. leaders were disenchanted by a top-down approach toward choosing candidates, as well as what they called a misguided belief that Mr. Modi’s popularity could allow the party to sidestep potent local issues and caste factors. With Mr. Modi sucking up all the oxygen at the top, other senior leaders of the party have been left to fight for relevance and a voice. His relentless self-promotion has also alienated the leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., the B.J.P.’s right-wing fountainhead. During election seasons, the R.S.S. activates its vast grass-roots network in support of B.J.P. candidates. While Mr. Modi, a former foot soldier in the organization, has advanced many of its goals, his consolidation of power goes against its regimented nature and its focus on ideology over individual personalities. One R.S.S. insider, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking, said that Mr. Modi’s exalting of himself had created such resentment inside the group that some of its leaders welcomed any sort of reality check for him, short of his ouster. Sudheendra Kulkarni, a political analyst who served as an aide to the first B.J.P. prime minister in the 1990s, said Mr. Modi had pushed through unpopular legislation — in particular farm laws that prompted a yearlong protest that choked New Delhi — without consulting with party officials in the affected states. They were left to cope with the ramifications. “The B.J.P. was never a one-leader party,” Mr. Kulkarni said. “All that changed with Narendra Modi in 2014. He sought to promote a new authoritarian idea of one nation, one leader.” Hypothesizing that Mr. Modi’s popularity had peaked, the opposition saw an opening to go after a decisive section of votes in the Indian political formula. For decades before his rise in 2014, neither the B.J.P. nor the Indian National Congress, the country’s two largest parties, could muster majorities on its own. Mr. Modi expanded his party’s backing by consolidating right-wing Hindu voters and drawing in new supporters with his personal story of a humble caste and economic background and a promise to change lives through robust development. A decade later, in this year’s election, the opposition found traction in painting a very different picture of Mr. Modi — as an autocratic friend of billionaires. Since Mr. Modi had achieved everything he had set out to do, the opposition argued, his pursuit of a resounding majority could only mean that he would seek radical change to the Constitution. That claim stirred anxiety among India’s Dalits and other underprivileged groups, who see the Constitution as their only protection in a deeply unequal society, guaranteeing them a share of government jobs and seats in higher education as well as elected bodies. The opposition was able to push the message harder when some in Mr. Modi’s right-wing support base, long seen as having an upper-caste bias, called for revoking the quotas. Caste identity was a major driving factor for voters in many states, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, with its 80 parliamentary seats. The decline of a Dalit party in the state meant that about 20 percent of the votes were potentially up for grabs. In Ayodhya, the constituency where Mr. Modi inaugurated a grand Ram temple earlier this year in an effort to consolidate his Hindu support base, the opposition put up a Dalit candidate. He handily defeated the B.J.P.’s two-term incumbent. In other cases, voters showed their anger over the B.J.P.’s perceived sense of impunity. In Kheri, a constituency where the son of a B.J.P. minister rammed his S.U.V. into a crowd of protesting farmers, killing several, the minister also lost. Mr. Modi’s election campaign took its most divisive turn in Banswara, in the desert state of Rajasthan, where he called India’s 200 million Muslims “infiltrators” and raised fears that the opposition would give them India’s wealth, including Hindu women’s necklaces. Banswara’s B.J.P. incumbent was routed in the election. While the loss was most likely attributable to local issues, the national discussion noted that Mr. Modi’s comments had not helped. In his own constituency of Varanasi, in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Modi’s winning margin of nearly half a million votes in 2019 shrank to about 150,000 — a disappointing showing after he had dispatched some of the B.J.P.’s most senior leaders to camp out there to help him achieve an even bigger victory. Jai Prakash, a tea and samosa seller in Varanasi, said some of the prime minister’s work, particularly his improvement of roads, was popular. But Mr. Modi was losing the plot, Mr. Prakash said, by turning to issues disconnected from people’s day-to-day lives. “Prices are skyrocketing; so is unemployment,” Mr. Prakash said. “He has done some good. But people cannot worship him endlessly.”",everything became prime minister narendra modi india party centuryold hindunationalist network propelled unimagined height back singular charisma political

nytimes,"India Keeps Its Glorious, Messy Tradition Alive","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/opinion/india-election-modi-bjp-democracy.html,"Back in January, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India looked all but unstoppable, he visited the small city of Ayodhya for the unofficial start of his campaign to win a third term. The location was freighted with symbolism. For decades, Hindu nationalists had sought to build a temple in Ayodhya, at a spot they believe to be the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. The only problem was that there was already a house of worship on the spot, a mosque built by a Mughal emperor in 1528. A Hindu mob had dismantled the mosque in 1992, setting off riots that killed 2,000 people, most of them Muslims. The ruins were a flashpoint of religious tensions in India for decades. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party promised to build the temple, and the lavish event at which Modi officially opened it was a showcase for that achievement. At the time it seemed like strong election-year messaging for a politician who built his career on the twin planks of Hindu nationalism and building a muscular new India. Unlike other politicians, the event implied, Modi made promises and kept them. “It is the beginning of a new era,” he declared. Feeling supremely confident, Modi had boldly asked the Indian electorate for something akin to a blank check to remake the country — control of 400 seats in Parliament in elections that began in April and concluded on June 1. And why shouldn’t he have been confident? India’s economy was the fastest-growing in the world. India had overtaken China as the world’s most-populous country. World leaders sought Modi’s support on issues ranging from the war in Ukraine to the climate crisis, cementing India’s ascent in global affairs. But the ever unpredictable electorate of the world’s largest democracy responded to Modi’s demand for still more power resolutely: No thanks. In a stunning rebuke, election results released on Tuesday showed that India’s voters have reduced the parliamentary share of Modi’s party by more than 60 seats, not enough for an outright majority, never mind the supermajority he had sought. It struck me as particularly apt that despite all the fanfare about the glorious new temple in Ayodhya, Modi’s party lost the city’s parliamentary seat to a political opposition that had been all but left for dead. There appears to be a clear ceiling to the appeals to Hindu identity on its own. “We are very happy with the temple, but people were fed up with the B.J.P.,” a local business leader, Rakesh Yadav, told Reuters. “People will not always fall for the caste or temple-mosque politics. They also want to see development.” This is a big year for democracy, almost a referendum of sorts on the very idea. Dozens of countries are holding elections, representing roughly half of the world’s population. But authoritarianism has been on the march. The latest report from Freedom House found that by many measures, global freedom has declined for the 18th straight year. India, despite its status as the world’s most-populous democracy, has been a poster child for this decline under Modi: His government has taken aim at just about every form of freedom. He has attacked and grievously weakened the independence of India’s once boisterous press. He has jailed critics and political opponents. He has sharpened religious animosity, referring during this campaign to Muslims, who make up 14 percent of India’s population, as “infiltrators” who seek to steal wealth and power from the Hindu majority. It’s an Indian edition of the nationalist, populist playbook playing out around the world. That a newly unified opposition managed to prevent Modi’s party from winning an outright majority under these conditions took everyone, including me, by surprise. And it suggests that even when would-be authoritarians attempt to tilt the playing field, voters can and will state their will, no matter the autocrat’s preferences. “The B.J.P. had positioned itself as a new hegemonic power,” Yamini Aiyar, a scholar and analyst of Indian democracy who has been a frequent target of Hindu nationalist rage, told me. “The beauty of an election is that politicians have to go to the people, and the people get an opportunity to express their anxieties and their perspectives.” Express them they did. Looking back, the weakness of the B.J.P.’s re-election case is clear: Yes, India’s economy was growing fast. But despite the flashy new infrastructure projects and deals to increase high-tech manufacturing, the growth was not creating nearly enough jobs, and inflation remained stubbornly high, especially for food, which hits the poorest hardest. Much of the wealth generated by growth has gone to India’s richest tycoons, and inequality has soared. “The reality is that the real economy has been hurting for a very long time, and they have systematically sought to ignore it,” Aiyar said. India has managed to lift millions of people out of poverty since Modi came to power 10 years ago, but particularly in rural areas, where most Indians live, that has meant social welfare rather than jobs. There were other issues too — Modi’s allies had floated the idea of changing India’s Constitution in various ways, including removing its commitment to secularism and enshrining Hinduism as the national faith. These kinds of appeals have helped the B.J.P. in the past but seem to have had less power this time around. One clear sign was its heavy losses in Uttar Pradesh, which is not just India’s most populous state; it is also part of the heavily Hindu heartland of northern India. It also seems that the opposition may finally have gotten its act together. India’s main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, has been in decline for years and had struggled to make common cause with other opposition parties in previous elections. But this year the opposition parties managed to make a much stronger coalition. They focused on kitchen table issues and highlighted the Modi government’s ties to big business and high-flying billionaires. The opposition didn’t shy away from making the stakes for Indian democracy clear. But the relentless focus on what voters said mattered most offers lessons for those battling revanchist movements elsewhere, including in the United States. Sometimes you need to meet voters where they are. This vote wasn’t a total rebuke of Modi and his policies. He is all but certain to get his third term as prime minister by making a coalition with allied parties. But it is a clear and salutary check on his authoritarian project. This election is also a rebuke of Indian elites — in business and media especially — who had willingly surrendered to a kind of inevitability of Modi’s long-term consolidation of power, making peace with it or even celebrating it. Activists, analysts and journalists who had the temerity to speak plainly about Modi’s revanchist project and the threat he posed to the world’s biggest democracy and its long history of tolerance, secularism and free speech have been hounded out of public life. I hope that this troubling slide ends now. As the results rolled in on Tuesday, I remembered my own reporting trip to Ayodhya in 2009, when I was a correspondent for The Times based in India. An explosive new government report had just been issued about the destruction of the mosque and the role of Hindu nationalist groups in stirring up violence. But when I got there, I was surprised to find that on the hotly contested spot itself there was hardly any hoopla. The crowds of Hindu nationalist volunteers who for years had routinely shown up to build the temple with their bare hands had disappeared. India was going through a period of hopeful prosperity. Voters had just returned the Indian National Congress party and its allies to power with a larger majority, and a brilliant, teetotaling economist named Manmohan Singh was prime minister. With the future looking so alluring, no one seemed all that interested in litigating the past. These hopes were ultimately dashed amid scandals over political corruption and mismanagement. The Congress party, which once seemed unstoppable, lost power in 2014 for failing to deliver on its promise to bring India to its long-awaited place among the world’s richest and most powerful nations. The years ahead will, with any luck, be ones of negotiation and compromise. This will be a return to form for India, a vastly diverse nation whose unruly polity has resisted autocracy at every turn since it shrugged off British colonial rule in 1947. The whole world should breathe a sigh of relief that India’s voters have spoken, loudly, in favor of continuing that glorious, messy tradition.",back january prime minister narendra modi india looked

nytimes,The New Kingmakers Who Could Make or Break Modi’s Government,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-elections-modi-coalition.html,"After his first two national election victories, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India easily set his own terms, with his Bharatiya Janata Party winning clear majorities. The result was different in this vote. It was still a victory, but one that left him dependent on a host of coalition partners — particularly on politicians from two regional parties who could make or break Mr. Modi’s ability to form a government. Of the more than a dozen parties that make up the B.J.P.’s coalition, known as the National Democratic Alliance, most won just one or two seats, leaving the party in a difficult predicament. On Wednesday, the B.J.P. said it had reached an agreement to form a coalition government that includes those two regional parties — the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United. They will be the biggest junior partners, but they are also avowedly secular and removed from Mr. Modi’s Hindu-nationalist ideology. Cameras on Wednesday followed every word, meeting and movement of the leaders of the two parties, N. Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party, and Nitish Kumar of Janata Dal-United. Their combined 28 seats in Parliament will give the prime minister the votes he needs to stay in power and push through his agenda. Here is what to know about the men who unexpectedly found themselves as kingmakers, and about the parties they lead. Though some of the members of the B.J.P.’s coalition this year share Mr. Modi’s hard-line vision, both the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United are moderate, secular parties that have a diverse support base. Speculation in India was focusing on what terms the men were demanding for their support, which are unlikely to be rooted in ideology. Both Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar are known to be pragmatic, deal-making politicians whose priorities will be practical concessions for their state, or perhaps cabinet positions. Mr. Kumar has earned a reputation in India for his willingness to switch allegiances over the past decade. He has gone between aligning himself with the B.J.P.-led coalition to supporting its rivals no fewer than five times. Most recently, in January, he returned to Mr. Modi’s alliance just 18 months after he’d left it and with just months to go until the election. He has said his switching of political loyalties was in the interest of his state, Bihar. Mr. Naidu has also at times broken with Mr. Modi, cutting ties with the B.J.P. in 2018 and joining forces with its chief rival, Indian National Congress, ahead of the 2019 elections. He has said that his party has aligned with the B.J.P. out of “political compulsion.” Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar have both been in politics for decades, and have been mentioned as potential candidates for prime minister. Mr. Naidu of the T.D.P., based in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, is a technocrat who has aggressively pushed for investment from information technology companies in his region.

nytimes,"Modi se reelige en India, pero pierde mayoría parlamentaria: 4 claves de las elecciones","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/06/05/espanol/elecciones-india-modi.html,"[Estamos en WhatsApp. Empieza a seguirnos ahora] La primera década de Narendra Modi como primer ministro de India ha estado plagada de sorpresas. Ninguna, sin embargo, se comparó con lo que ocurrió el martes por la mañana, cuando Modi ganó su segunda reelección, pero su partido perdió la mayoría en el Parlamento. Con esa derrota, el aire de invencibilidad de Modi también pareció desvanecerse por primera vez desde que asumió el cargo en 2014. Los resultados de las elecciones fueron particularmente interesantes porque, tras casi siete semanas de votaciones en todo el país, las encuestas a pie de urna publicadas pocos días antes del recuento final mostraban que el Partido Popular Indio de Modi ganaría de forma aplastante, como ya había hecho en dos ocasiones anteriores. Sin embargo, el Partido Popular Indio solo obtuvo 239 escaños, muy por debajo de los 272 necesarios para formar gobierno. La alianza de la oposición, liderada por el Partido del Congreso Nacional Indio, obtuvo 235 escaños. Con los 52 escaños obtenidos por los aliados del Partido Popular Indio, Modi seguirá a la cabeza. Pero su atractivo ha disminuido y su liderazgo ha cambiado radicalmente. Cuando Modi llegó al poder en 2014, prometió progreso económico, el fin de la corrupción y la promoción del hinduismo como elemento central de la identidad india. Con todo ello, se presentó como un líder singularmente fuerte, capaz de reunir a sus seguidores para trabajar por la nación. Esto contrastaba con el gobierno anterior. Antes de que Modi fuera elegido por primera vez, India llevaba 25 años gobernada por coaliciones. Los primeros ministros del Partido del Congreso, del Partido Popular Indio y de terceros partidos más pequeños se alternaban para dirigir India por comités. Modi rompió con esa tradición y lideró un nuevo sistema de partido único dominado por el Partido Popular Indio. Como líder, Modi mostró poco interés en compartir el poder. Cuando invalidó la mayor parte del papel moneda de India en 2016, ni siquiera su ministro de Finanzas conocía la decisión de antemano. Cuando decidió imponer la ley marcial en Jammu y Cachemira, el único estado de mayoría musulmana de India, presentó el plan al Parlamento como un hecho, sin pedir su aprobación. Pero esos días han terminado. Los dos mayores partidos que han surgido como nuevos socios de coalición del Partido Popular Indio están liderados por N. Chandrababu Naidu y Nitish Kumar, legisladores veteranos a quienes se conoce como tecnócratas moderados. Es probable que ambos exijan más autoridad en el Parlamento. De hecho, ambos han sido señalados como posibles candidatos a primer ministro, si se produjera otra coalición que no estuviera liderada ni por el Partido Popular Indio ni por el Congreso Nacional Indio. Cuando el martes se dieron a conocer los primeros mapas electorales nacionales que mostraban el número de escaños ganados y perdidos en el Parlamento, se observó una nueva y sorprendente configuración. Los mapas mostraban que el partido de Modi había perdido zonas de territorio en los estados del norte de habla hindi, considerados bastiones del Partido Popular Indio. Al mismo tiempo, el su partido avanzó en regiones que se habían resistido a Modi en el pasado. Perdió decenas de escaños en el estado septentrional de Uttar Pradesh, pero ganó muchos en el estado oriental de Odisha y en el estado meridional de Telangana. La única parte del país que ahora parece unificada por un partido es el “cinturón tribal”, que atraviesa los estados centrales. Sus comunidades relativamente pobres han sido hábilmente puestas en la mira de la política hinduista y los beneficios sociales del Partido Popular Indio. Los inversores de los mercados bursátiles indios de Mumbai respondieron con entusiasmo a las primeras encuestas a pie de urna. El lunes, se lanzaron a la compra, haciendo subir los precios de las llamadas acciones de Modi, aquellas asociadas a las prioridades de gasto del primer ministro o que se cree que se benefician de sus políticas fiscales. Cuando se conocieron los resultados de las urnas, esas acciones se desplomaron. Las acciones del buque insignia del Grupo Adani perdieron cerca del 19 por ciento de su valor en un solo día de cotización. El índice bursátil perdió cerca del 6 por ciento, casi anulando las ganancias de los cinco primeros meses del año. Modi sigue siendo popular entre los magnates de India, pero los inversores deben averiguar qué empresas se beneficiarán del nuevo gobierno. Chris Wood, responsable mundial de estrategia de renta variable del banco de inversión Jefferies, advirtió el año pasado que si Modi perdía, “cabría esperar una corrección del 25 por ciento, si no más”, en el mercado bursátil indio. Históricamente, a las empresas indias les ha ido igual de bien durante los periodos de gobierno de coalición. Por lo tanto, Wood dijo que, incluso sin Modi en el poder, espera que las acciones “se recuperen bruscamente” sobre la base de la fortaleza de la economía del país en su conjunto. Esta nueva era en el Parlamento empezará seguramente con algunas rondas de retribuciones políticas. Los políticos que no hayan conseguido escaños para sus jefes serán despedidos. Es probable que los partidos más pequeños exijan puestos en el gabinete, lo que significará sustituir a miembros del Partido Popular Indio. Habrá que revisar las políticas. ¿Se inclinará India por la exportación de manufacturas, con el objetivo de sustituir a China como la fábrica del mundo? ¿Protegerá ahora a las industrias locales que temen la competencia extranjera? Milan Vaishnav, investigador de la Fundación Carnegie para la Paz Internacional, advirtió que India no puede volver exactamente a la política de coalición que precedió a Modi. Es probable que sus nuevos socios exijan un estilo autoritario similar al que Modi ejerce desde Nueva Delhi. El tipo de líderes estatales que necesita ahora como socios de coalición “son tan absolutistas como el gobierno nacional”, dijo Vaishnav. Podrían, por ejemplo, pedir a la policía federal que detuviera a sus oponentes, como ha hecho Modi. Las elecciones de India fueron las mayores celebradas en la historia de la democracia, con más de 600 millones de votantes en seis fases. Esta vez no hubo quejas sobre las máquinas de votación electrónica, ni temores de que India se hubiera convertido en una dictadura bajo el mandato de Modi. En un discurso difícil pronunciado el martes por la noche desde la sede del Partido Popular Indio, Modi calificó las elecciones de “celebración de la democracia”.",estamos en whatsapp empieza

nytimes,Modi Struggles to Stay on Top: 4 Takeaways From India’s Election,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-election-2024-takeaways.html,"Narendra Modi’s first decade as India’s prime minister came with its fair share of surprises. None, however, looked anything like what happened on Tuesday morning when he won his second re-election, but lost his party’s majority in Parliament. With that loss, Mr. Modi’s air of invincibility also appeared to be fading for the first time since he took office in 2014. The election results were especially shocking because, after nearly seven sweaty weeks of voting across the country, exit polls released just days before the final tally showed that Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party would win in a landslide, as it had twice before. Instead, the Bharatiya Janata Party won only 240 seats, well short of the 272 needed to form a government. The opposition alliance, led by the Indian National Congress Party, took 235 seats. With the 52 seats won by B.J.P. allies, Mr. Modi will remain on top. But his allure has been diminished, and his leadership has fundamentally changed. When Mr. Modi came to power in 2014, he promised economic progress, an end to corruption and to promote Hinduism as being central to India’s identity. Through it all, he presented himself as a uniquely strong leader, capable of marshaling his followers to work for the nation.",narendra modis first decade india prime minister came fair share surprise none however looked anything like happened tuesday morning second reelection lost party majority parliament loss mr modis air invincibility also appeared fading first time since took office election result especially shocking nearly seven sweaty week voting across country exit poll released day final tally showed mr modis bharatiya janata party would win landslide twice instead bharatiya janata party seat well short needed form government opposition alliance led indian national congress party took seat seat bjp ally mr modi remain top allure diminished leadership fundamentally changed mr modi came power promised economic progress end corruption promote hinduism central india identity presented uniquely strong leader capable marshaling follower work nation
nytimes,"Needing Help to Stay in Power, Modi Loses His Aura of Invincibility","June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/modi-india-election.html,"Suddenly, the aura of invincibility around Narendra Modi has been shattered. In an Indian election in which his party’s slogan had promised a landslide victory and Mr. Modi even repeatedly referred to himself as sent by God, the results announced on Tuesday were unexpectedly sobering. Mr. Modi, 73, is set to take up a third consecutive term as prime minister, after the Election Commission gave final confirmation early Wednesday that the parties that make up his coalition had collectively passed the majority mark in Parliament. It is a feat that only one other Indian leader has accomplished, and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., won far more seats than any other party. But instead of a runaway win, the B.J.P. lost dozens of seats. It now finds itself at the mercy of its coalition partners — including one politician notorious for how often he has switched sides — to stay in power, a sharp reversal a decade into Mr. Modi’s transformational tenure. As the results came into view, the country’s stock markets plunged. Opposition parties, newly unified in what they had called an effort to save the country’s democracy, rejoiced. And India, while extending Mr. Modi’s firm hold on power, learned that there are limits to his political potency, even as he made the election, usually fought seat by seat, squarely about himself. Mr. Modi took a more positive view in a statement on X declaring that his coalition had won a third term. “This is a historical feat in India’s history,” he said. For Mr. Modi, a generous reading of the outcome could be that only with his personal push could his party overcome its unpopularity at the local level and scrape by. Or it could be that his carefully cultivated brand has now peaked, and that he can no longer outrun the anti-incumbency sentiment that eventually catches up with almost any politician. How Mr. Modi will react is uncertain — whether he will harden his effort to turn away any challenge to his power, or be chastened by the voters’ verdict and his need to work with coalition partners that do not share his Hindu-nationalist ideology. “Modi is not known as a consensual figure. However, he is very pragmatic,” said Arati Jerath, a political analyst based in New Delhi. “He will have to moderate his hard-line Hindu-nationalist approach to issues. Perhaps we can hope for more moderation from him.” Few doubt, however, that Mr. Modi will try to deepen his already considerable imprint on the country over the next five years. On his watch, India, the world’s most populous nation, has enjoyed newfound prominence on the global stage, overhauled its infrastructure for the needs of its 1.4 billion people, and been imbued with a new sense of ambition as it tries to shed the legacy of its long colonial past. At the same time, Mr. Modi has worked to turn a vastly diverse country held together by a secular democratic system into an overtly Hindu-first state, marginalizing the country’s large Muslim minority. His increasingly authoritarian turn — with a crackdown on dissent that has created a chilling environment of self-censorship — has pushed India’s vociferous democracy closer to a one-party state, his critics say. And the country’s economic growth, while rapid, has mostly enriched those at the top. Mr. Modi rose from a humble background as the son of a tea seller, becoming India’s most powerful and popular leader in decades by building a cult of personality, spending big on infrastructure and welfare, and tilting India’s democratic institutions in his favor. The ultimate goal was to cement his standing as one of the most consequential prime ministers in India’s nearly 75 years as a republic and make the B.J.P. the country’s only plausible national governing force. But the results on Tuesday pointed to a sharp turnaround for India’s beleaguered main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, which had been seen by many as irrevocably weakened after big losses in the previous two elections. The once-dominant Congress, long positioned at India’s political center, struggled for years to find a direction and offer an ideological alternative to the B.J.P. But it and its coalition partners found traction in this election by attacking Mr. Modi’s government over issues like unemployment, social justice and the prime minister’s ties to India’s billionaires. Last year, as Rahul Gandhi, the public face of the Congress party, sought to burnish his standing by leading long marches across India, the B.J.P. ensnared him in a court case that led to his expulsion from Parliament. He was later returned to his seat by India’s highest court, and was set to win re-election on Tuesday. Speaking as early returns came in, Mr. Gandhi, 53, said the fight was not just against the B.J.P. It was also, he said, against all the government institutions that had stood with Mr. Modi in trying to hamstring the opposition through arrests and other punitive actions. “This was about saving the Constitution,” he said, lifting a small copy that he had been carrying with him and displaying during speeches on the campaign trail. Exit polls released on Saturday, after more than six weeks of voting in the world’s largest democratic exercise, indicated that Mr. Modi’s party was headed toward an easy victory. But there had been signs during the campaign that Mr. Modi was worried about the outcome. He crisscrossed the country for more than 200 rallies over about two months and gave dozens of interviews, hoping to use his charismatic appeal to paper over any weaknesses in his party. In speeches, he often veered from his party’s message of a rising India to counter accusations that he privileged business and caste elites. He also abandoned his once-subtle dog whistles targeting India’s 200 million Muslims, instead demonizing them directly, by name. As things stood by nightfall, Mr. Modi would need at least 33 seats from allies to cross the 272 minimum for forming a government. Two regional parties in particular would be kingmakers: the Telugu Desam Party, in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, with 16 seats, and the Janata Dal (United) party in the eastern state of Bihar, with 12. Both parties are avowedly secular, raising hopes among Mr. Modi’s opponents that their influence could slow down his race to turn India’s democracy into a Hindu-first state. Some of Mr. Modi’s biggest losses came in India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh in the north, with about 240 million people. His party leads the state government and had won 62 of the state’s 80 seats in the national Parliament’s lower house in the previous election, in 2019. As counting entered its last stretch in the evening on Tuesday, the B.J.P. was leading in only 33 seats there. In his own constituency, Varanasi, Mr. Modi’s victory margin was reduced from half a million last time to about 150,000. The loss in Faizabad constituency, in particular, told the story of how some of the prime minister’s biggest offerings had struggled to connect with voters. The constituency is home to the lavish Ram temple in Ayodhya, built on grounds disputed between Hindus and Muslims. Its construction was a cornerstone of the nearly century-old Hindu-nationalist movement that had swept Mr. Modi to power. He hoped that its grand inauguration just before the election campaign began would both unite his Hindu support base and bring new supporters into the fold. Some B.J.P. workers said that the party’s flaunting of the temple may have made a large section of Hindus at the bottom of the rigid caste hierarchy uncomfortable. The opposition had painted Mr. Modi as pursuing an upper-caste agenda that denied underprivileged Hindus opportunities to reverse centuries of oppression. “Because of overemphasis on the Ram temple issue, the opposition got united,” said Subhash Punia, 62, a farmer from the state of Rajasthan who supports Mr. Modi and was waiting outside the B.J.P. headquarters in Delhi on Tuesday. To offset potential losses in his Hindi-speaking northern stronghold, Mr. Modi had set a lofty goal for this election: to gain a foothold in the country’s more prosperous south. He broke some new ground in Kerala, a state dominated by the political left and long hostile to his ideology. But overall in the south, he struggled to improve on the 29 seats, out of 129, that his party had won in the previous election. Perhaps the biggest disappointment for the B.J.P. in southern India was that it once again appeared not to have won any of the 40 seats in Tamil Nadu, a state with its own strong cultural and linguistic identity. Mr. Modi had campaigned aggressively there, even visiting one coastal town for two days of meditation as the voting neared its conclusion. “Mr. Modi’s and the B.J.P.’s antics cannot win my Tamil heart,” said S. Ganesan, a waiter at a hotel in Kanniyakumari, the town Mr. Modi visited.",suddenly aura invincibility around narendra modi shattered indian election party slogan promised landslide victory mr modi

nytimes,Modi Will Feel the Heat in a Third Term. And Not Just Politically.,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/climate/modi-climate-india-election.html,"India, the world’s most populous country, is also among the most vulnerable to climate hazards. That’s not only because of the heat and floods that global warming has exacerbated, but also because so many of the country’s 1.4 billion people are vulnerable to begin with. Most people are poor, by global standards, and they have no safety net. Narendra Modi, the Hindu nationalist prime minister who claimed victory Tuesday for a third five-year term, will face major challenges fueled by climate change. The six-week process of voting took place amid a scorching heat wave in several parts of the country. In the northern states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, at least 33 people, including poll workers, died of complications from the heat last week, according to government authorities cited by Reuters. Rohit Magotra, deputy director of Integrated Research and Action for Development, called on national election officials to reschedule elections in the future to avoid such calamities. He pointed out that workers from every political party suffer in the heat, and so do voters, who often have to line up under the sun. “I definitely see the momentum building up, and elections are unlikely to be scheduled in peak summer in future,” said Mr. Magotra, whose organization has advocated heat solutions in Indian cities. The Election Commission this year did set up a task force to monitor weather conditions, but only after voting got underway amid abnormally high temperatures. It also sent election workers a list of heat precautions prepared by the National Disaster Management Agency. However, according to a report published in Scroll, an Indian news site, political-party campaigners were not told to do anything differently because of the heat. While parliamentary elections are traditionally scheduled in summer in India, climate change is making summers increasingly dangerous. This year, one weather station in Delhi broke the all-time temperature record with a reading above 52 degrees Celsius (127 degrees Fahrenheit) in late May. It was the third consecutive year of abnormally high temperatures in India, all made worse by climate change, according to scientific studies of the heat waves. Several cities and states have heat action plans, at least on paper. But as one independent analysis concluded last year, they are mostly underfunded and lack concrete ways to identify and protect the most vulnerable. Mr. Modi’s government has faced some of the most potent opposition in recent years from farmers’ organizations. And many of their concerns are rooted in climate issues. Their agitation reflects a deep malaise in agriculture, a major slice of the Indian economy. More than half of all Indians depend on farming to make a living. Groundwater is in short supply in many important agricultural regions. Farmers are in deep debt in many parts of the country. On top of that, extreme weather and unpredictable rains have wrecked harvests repeatedly in recent years. In 2020, hundreds of thousands of farmers, mostly from India’s breadbasket region of Punjab and Haryana, erected encampments outside of New Delhi and rolled their tractors into the capital in protests that turned violent. Their initial grievance was over Mr. Modi’s efforts to open up more private investment in agriculture, which the farmers said would make them vulnerable to low prices driven by corporate profit motives. In the face of the uprising, the government backed down, a rarity for Mr. Modi, but also a move that signals the seriousness with which his administration took the protests. Again this year, farmers marched on the capital, this time demanding higher government-set prices for wheat and rice. The global image of India is often associated with its fast-growing economy, its vibrant cities and its huge, young work force. But a majority of its people still depend on farm incomes, most of its 770 million poor people live in the countryside, and the government has been unable to create anywhere near the number of jobs outside agriculture that its booming youth population demands. Fixing agriculture in the era of climate change is likely to be among Mr. Modi’s most profound challenges in the coming years. “Definitely, increasing extreme weather events (floods, heat waves, storms) are the most important climate challenge facing the government,” said M. Rajeevan, a former secretary in the Earth Sciences Ministry who is now vice chancellor at Atria University in Bengaluru. Climate change is driven principally by the burning of fossil fuels, the dirtiest of which is coal. At international summits, Mr. Modi has emphasized his push to build renewable energy infrastructure. At the same time though, his government has continued to expand coal. That’s driven by both political and economic considerations. Coal is the incumbent fuel. Public and private companies, many of them politically connected, are invested in coal. The government’s main interest is in keeping electricity prices low. Coal remains the country’s biggest source of electricity. Coal use grew this year, partly driven by climate change itself. Higher temperatures drive up demand for air-conditioners and fans, which drives up demand for electricity. India’s power-sector emissions soared in the first quarter of 2024, according to Ember, a research organization that tracks emissions.

nytimes,India’s Stock Market Tumbles on Close-Run Election Result,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-stock-market-election.html,"Traders in Mumbai started the day with a shock as India began tallying votes from a seven-week election and it became clear that the government of Narendra Modi was not doing nearly as well as expected. By the end of trading on Tuesday, the markets were down 6 percent, nearly wiping out the year’s gains. India’s stock market had been on a tear, buoyed by economic growth and confidence that Mr. Modi, the most powerful prime minister in generations, was sure to secure a third term in office. Investors looking to India yearn for political stability and many have done especially well during the first 10 years of Mr. Modi’s pro-business leadership. Even after Tuesday’s decline, the blue-chip Nifty 50 index has nearly tripled since Mr. Modi became prime minister. But the Indian market’s main indexes have entered choppier waters on the way to the election. Some companies, namely those considered “Modi stocks,” fared especially poorly as the election result came into view. The Adani Group’s fortunes were always the most eye-catching. Gautam Adani rapidly became Asia’s richest man, as his infrastructure-oriented businesses worked in harmony with Mr. Modi’s plans for the country. That is, until a short-seller’s report in early 2023 accused the Adani Group of market manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani’s stocks crashed, but within a year, as it became clear that the Indian government and many of the world’s biggest banks would be patient with the companies, they climbed back up. On Tuesday, Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship company, shed 19 percent of its value, putting it halfway between its peak and subsequent trough. Mr. Modi has anyway won enough seats to form a new government, albeit with a much slimmer majority than forecast. Chris Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, an investment bank, last year gamed out an even worse result for Mr. Modi, saying during an investor summit in October that if Mr. Modi were suddenly defeated, “I would expect a 25 percent correction if not more.” Some degree of correction might be welcomed, at least among professional investors. A lot of the market’s recent growth has reflected the influx of small-time local investors buying stocks for the first time. With global investors clamoring for access to India’s long-term prospects, it had become nearly impossible to find bargains. Christine Phillpotts, portfolio manager for emerging markets at Ariel Investments in Chicago, said India had become “the market that everybody loves to love.” That meant there weren’t many opportunities left, even though she agreed that India’s economy would keep growing robustly. The other consolation is that, as much as investors need to know which government policies will favor which companies, India’s track record suggests that its economy is capable of growing rapidly under conditions of vigorous, multiparty democracy. Some of the fastest rates it ever clocked were achieved under a previous coalition government, during a growth spurt from 2006 to 2010. Even Mr. Wood, who anticipated a market decline in response to Mr. Modi’s losing ground, thought that stocks “would bounce back sharply, due to the momentum” of India’s economy as a whole.",trader mumbai started day shock india began tallying vote sevenweek election became clear government narendra modi nearly well expected end trading tuesday market percent nearly wiping year gain india stock market tear buoyed economic growth confidence mr modi powerful prime minister generation sure secure third term office investor looking india yearn political stability many done especially well first year mr modis probusiness leadership even tuesday decline bluechip nifty index nearly tripled since mr modi became prime minister indian market main index entered choppier water way election company namely considered modi stock fared especially poorly election result came view adani group fortune always eyecatching gautam adani rapidly became asia richest man infrastructureoriented business worked harmony mr modis plan country shortsellers report early accused adani group market manipulation accounting fraud adanis stock crashed within year became clear indian government many world biggest bank would patient company climbed back tuesday adani enterprise group flagship company shed percent value putting halfway peak subsequent trough mr modi anyway enough seat form new government albeit much slimmer majority forecast chris wood global head equity strategy jefferies investment bank last year gamed even worse result mr modi saying investor summit october mr modi suddenly defeated would expect percent correction degree correction might welcomed least among professional investor lot market recent growth reflected influx smalltime local investor buying stock first time global investor clamoring access india longterm prospect become nearly impossible find bargain christine phillpotts portfolio manager emerging market ariel investment chicago said india become market everybody love love meant werent many opportunity left even though agreed india economy would keep growing robustly consolation much investor need know government policy favor company india track record suggests economy capable growing rapidly condition vigorous multiparty democracy fastest rate ever clocked achieved previous coalition government growth spurt even mr wood anticipated market decline response mr modis losing ground thought stock would bounce back sharply due momentum india economy whole
nytimes,Early Election Results Suggest Sharp Turnaround for Indian National Congress,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/indian-national-congress-rahul-gandhi-election.html,"In India’s last general election, in 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party won 303 of 543 parliamentary seats — nearly six times as many as the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress. It was a stinging electoral blow for the Congress, a once-dominant party that has appeared greatly diminished in recent years, and exit polls in this year’s election had not suggested it would fare much better. But early election results on Tuesday indicated a far stronger showing than expected for the Congress. The party and its allies were leading in nearly 230 races, a sharp turnaround that prompted jubilation at the Congress headquarters in New Delhi, where supporters erupted in cheers each time a television channel announced a new lead for one of its candidates. “Whatever the final results, one thing is clear — it is a moral victory for Congress and our leader Rahul Gandhi, and defeat for B.J.P.,” said Robin Michael, a political worker, referring to Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. While there was no indication that Congress and the opposition coalition it leads would scrape together a majority to unseat Mr. Modi, party workers said that they had dented Mr. Modi’s aura of invincibility. They praised Mr. Gandhi, the Congress party’s most prominent figure and a great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first post-independence prime minister. Last year, as Mr. Gandhi sought to burnish his standing by leading long marches across India, the B.J.P. ensnared him in a court case that led to his expulsion from Parliament. He was later returned to his seat by India’s highest court. On Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi was on track to win his parliamentary seat in the southern state of Kerala. The Congress, long positioned at India’s political center, has struggled to find a direction and offer an ideological alternative to the Hindu nationalist B.J.P. It has faced rebellions, infighting and periodic fits of soul-searching over whether to rally behind a new face — only to stick with its dynastic leadership. This year, despite expectations, Mr. Gandhi had set a target of doubling the party’s 2019 tally of 52 seats. By late Tuesday afternoon, it was leading in nearly 100 seats. “We will stop Modi from making a mockery of this country and turning people against each other,” said Sandeep Mishra, a Congress worker at party headquarters. He added: “Indians are fed up with Modi.”",india last general election prime minister narendra modis party parliamentary seat nearly six time many main opposition party indian national congress stinging electoral blow congress oncedominant party appeared greatly diminished recent year exit poll year election suggested would fare much better early election result tuesday indicated far stronger showing expected congress party ally leading nearly race sharp turnaround prompted jubilation congress headquarters new delhi supporter erupted cheer time television channel announced new lead one candidate whatever final result one thing clear moral victory congress leader rahul gandhi defeat bjp said robin michael political worker referring mr modis bharatiya janata party indication congress opposition coalition lead would scrape together majority unseat mr modi party worker said dented mr modis aura invincibility praised mr gandhi congress party prominent figure greatgrandson jawaharlal nehru india first postindependence prime minister last year mr gandhi sought burnish standing leading long march across india bjp ensnared court case led expulsion parliament later returned seat india highest court tuesday mr gandhi track win parliamentary seat southern state kerala congress long positioned india political center struggled find direction offer ideological alternative hindu nationalist bjp faced rebellion infighting periodic fit soulsearching whether rally behind new face stick dynastic leadership year despite expectation mr gandhi set target doubling party tally seat late tuesday afternoon leading nearly seat stop modi making mockery country turning people said sandeep mishra congress worker party headquarters added indian fed modi

nytimes,Modi’s Party May Need Partners to Form a Government,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/modi-bjp-india-government-coalition.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party will likely need help from junior partners to form a government under the rules of India’s parliamentary system, early election results indicated on Tuesday. In a 2019 election that handed Mr. Modi a second consecutive term, his Bharatiya Janata Party won 303 of the 543 seats in Parliament. That was well over the 272 seats it needed to rule on its own. This time, exit polls released over the weekend suggested that the B.J.P. would once again easily win more than 272 seats. But as of early Tuesday afternoon, official voting results indicated that it would win about 240 seats instead. Winning that much support — 44 percent of the seats in Parliament’s lower house — is an impressive feat in India or any other country. And the new math should not prevent Mr. Modi from securing a third consecutive term as prime minister. But the dip in the B.J.P.’s electoral support, far short of Mr. Modi’s goal and his last electoral performance, will likely have political ramifications. At a minimum, the B.J.P. will have to depend more on the junior members of its existing multiparty alliance. Two of the most prominent parties do not share Mr. Modi’s Hindu-first agenda. And if the governing alliance does not win a majority, the B.J.P. will be able to form a government only by adding new partners. It may not come to that. As of Tuesday afternoon the alliance was on track to scrape by with a narrow parliamentary majority — far short of its target of 400 seats, but enough to stay in power with its existing members.",prime minister narendra modis ruling party likely need help junior partner form government rule india parliamentary system early election result indicated tuesday election handed mr modi second consecutive term bharatiya janata party seat parliament well seat needed rule time exit poll released weekend suggested bjp would easily win seat early tuesday afternoon official voting result indicated would win seat instead winning much support percent seat parliament lower house impressive feat india country new math prevent mr modi securing third consecutive term prime minister dip bjps electoral support far short mr modis goal last electoral performance likely political ramification minimum bjp depend junior member existing multiparty alliance two prominent party share mr modis hindufirst agenda governing alliance win majority bjp able form government adding new partner may come tuesday afternoon alliance track scrape narrow parliamentary majority far short target seat enough stay power existing member
nytimes,How Modi Capitalized on India’s Economic Rise,"June 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/asia/india-election-economy.html,"Ten years after Narendra Modi was first elected prime minister, India’s economy is roughly twice as large. That is what happens when a country grows at 7 percent a year, as India has been doing, on average, since it opened its markets to international competition in 1991. That steady growth has been skillfully repackaged to promote an image of one man’s leadership making it all happen. Along with nationalism and Hindu pride, the idea that Mr. Modi can make the economy move has been central to his appeal since the beginning. And Mr. Modi has burnished India’s economy in ways that count the most with voters: He made visible infrastructure expansions and distributed welfare benefits to the majority of Indians, who remain poor by global standards even as the country’s higher-income groups learn to flex their spending power. Most of the rest of the world — especially the United States and other Western countries that hope to persuade India to join them in constraining China’s and Russia’s strategic ambitions — wants India’s economy to accelerate. Part of that story could be a shift in manufacturing, like the one Apple has underway in South India. And the world’s investment professionals are eager for India’s successes under Mr. Modi to start paying dividends that they can’t find elsewhere. But even the most eager investors can’t overlook some of the problems that confront India as it becomes the world’s newest heavyweight. While Mr. Modi basked in the glow of a successful moon landing and the country’s innovative “digital public infrastructure,” the political opposition tried to speak past him to the frustrated masses who clamor for more and better jobs. The opposition also tried rousing public anger over Mr. Modi’s ties with the country’s biggest tycoons. That seems not to have worked, neither in politics nor in the markets, in the case of Gautam Adani. Last year the billionaire’s empire was accused, with much flash and fury, of stock manipulation. But the claims hardly broke through, and Adani stocks went back to soaring.",ten year narendra modi first elected prime minister india economy roughly twice large happens country grows percent year india average since opened market international competition steady growth skillfully repackaged promote image one man leadership making happen along nationalism hindu pride idea mr modi make economy move central appeal since beginning mr modi burnished india economy way count voter made visible infrastructure expansion distributed welfare benefit majority indian remain poor global standard even country higherincome group learn flex spending power rest world especially united state western country hope persuade india join constraining china russia strategic ambition want india economy accelerate part story could shift manufacturing like one apple underway south india world investment professional eager india success mr modi start paying dividend cant find elsewhere even eager investor cant overlook problem confront india becomes world newest heavyweight mr modi basked glow successful moon landing country innovative digital public infrastructure political opposition tried speak past frustrated mass clamor better job opposition also tried rousing public anger mr modis tie country biggest tycoon seems worked neither politics market case gautam adani last year billionaire empire accused much flash fury stock manipulation claim hardly broke adani stock went back soaring
nytimes,The Heat Wave Scenario That Keeps Climate Scientists Up at Night,"June 3, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/opinion/heat-technology-climate.html,"On a recent Thursday evening, a freakish windstorm called a derecho (Spanish for “straight ahead”) hit Houston, a city of more than two million people that also happens to be the epicenter of the fossil fuel industry in America. In a matter of minutes, winds of up to 100 miles per hour blew out office building windows, uprooted trees and toppled electric poles and transmission towers. Nearly a million households lost power. Which meant that not only was there no light; there was no air-conditioning. The damage from the storm was so extensive that, five days later, more than 100,000 homes and businesses were still marooned in the heat and darkness. Luckily, the day the derecho blew in, the temperature in Houston, a city infamous for its swampy summers, was in the low to mid-80s. Hot, to be sure, but for most healthy people, not life-threatening. Of the at least eight deaths reported as a result of the storm, none were from heat exposure. But if this storm had arrived several days later, perhaps over the Memorial Day weekend, when the temperature in Houston hit 96 degrees, with a heat index as high as 115, it might have been a very different story. “The Hurricane Katrina of extreme heat” is how Mikhail Chester, director of the Metis Center for Infrastructure and Sustainable Engineering at Arizona State University, once put it to me, echoing the memory of the catastrophic 2005 hurricane that struck Louisiana, devastated New Orleans and killed more than 1,300 people. Most people who died in Louisiana during Katrina died from drownings, injuries or heart conditions. But Dr. Chester was using Katrina as a metaphor for what can happen to a city unprepared for an extreme climate catastrophe. In New Orleans, the levee system was overwhelmed by torrential rains; eventually, 80 percent of the city was underwater. What if, instead, the electricity goes out for several days during a blistering summer heat wave in a city that depends on air-conditioning? In Dr. Chester’s scenario, a compounding crisis of extreme heat and a power failure in a major city like Houston could lead to cascading failures, exposing vulnerabilities in the region’s infrastructure that are difficult to foresee and could result in thousands, or even tens of thousands, of deaths from heat exposure in a matter of days. The risk to people in cities would be higher because all the concrete and asphalt amplifies the heat, pushing temperatures in the midafternoon as much as 15 degrees to 20 degrees higher than in surrounding vegetated areas. The derecho that hit Houston was a warning of just how quickly risks are multiplying in our rapidly warming world. As if to prove this point, some 10 days after the Houston blackout, another windstorm knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses in and around Dallas. One of the most dangerous illusions of the climate crisis is that the technology of modern life makes us invincible. Humans are smart. We have tools. Yeah, it will cost money. But we can adapt to whatever comes our way. As for the coral reefs that bleach in the hot oceans and the howler monkeys that fell dead out of trees during a recent heat wave in Mexico, well, that’s sad, but life goes on. This is, of course, an extremely privileged point of view. For one thing, more than 750 million people on the planet don’t have access to electricity, much less air-conditioning. (In India, New Delhi experienced temperatures as high as 120 degrees last week, leading to an increase in heatstroke, fears of blackouts and the possibility of water rationing.) But it is also a naïve point of view, if only because our bubble of invincibility is far more fragile than we know. So what can we expect in a heat Katrina? Last year, researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology, Arizona State University and the University of Michigan published a study looking at the consequences of a major blackout during an extreme heat wave in three cities: Phoenix, Detroit and Atlanta. In the study, the cause of the blackout was unspecified. “It doesn’t really matter if the blackout is the result of a cyberattack or a hurricane,” Brian Stone, the director of the Urban Climate Lab at Georgia Tech and the lead author on the study, told me. “For the purposes of our research, the effect is the same.” Whatever the cause, the study noted that the number of major blackouts in the United States more than doubled from 2015-16 to 2020-21. Dr. Stone and his colleagues focused on those three American cities because they have different demographics, climates and dependence on air-conditioning. In Detroit, 53 percent of buildings have central air-conditioning; in Atlanta, 94 percent; in Phoenix, 99 percent. The researchers modeled the health consequences for residents in a two-day, citywide blackout during a heat wave, with electricity gradually restored over the next three days. The results were shocking: In Phoenix, about 800,000 people — roughly half the population — would need emergency medical treatment for heatstroke and other illnesses. The flood of people seeking care would overwhelm the city’s hospitals. More than 13,000 people would die. Under the same scenario in Atlanta, researchers found there would be 12,540 visits to emergency rooms. Six people would die. In Detroit, which has a higher percentage of older residents and a higher poverty rate than those other cities, 221 people would die. Perhaps we should not be surprised by these numbers. Researchers estimate that in Europe there were 61,672 heat-related deaths in the summer of 2022, the hottest season on record on the continent at the time. In June 2021, a heat wave led to in nearly 900 excess deaths in the Pacific Northwest. And in 2010, an estimated 56,000 Russians died during a record summer heat wave. The hotter it gets, the more difficult it is for our bodies to cope, raising the risk of heatstroke and other heat illnesses. And it is getting hotter across the planet. Last year was the warmest year on record, and the 10 hottest years have all occurred in the last decade. In the study simulating a heat wave in those three cities, researchers found that the much larger death toll in Phoenix was explained by two factors. First, the temperatures modeled during a heat wave in Phoenix (90 to 113 degrees) were much higher than the temperatures in Atlanta (77 to 97 degrees) or Detroit (72 to 95 degrees), which have historically had milder heat waves. And second, the greater availability of air-conditioning in Phoenix means the risks from a power failure during a heat wave are much higher. A lot can be done to reduce these risks. Building cities with less concrete and asphalt and more parks and trees and access to rivers and lakes would help. So would a more sophisticated nationally standardized heat wave warning system. Major cities also need to identify the most vulnerable residents and develop targeted emergency response plans and long-term heat management plans. Making the grid itself more resilient is equally important. Better digital firewalls at grid operation centers thwart hacker intrusions. Burying transmission lines protects them from storms. Batteries to store electricity for emergencies are increasingly inexpensive. But the hotter it gets, the more vulnerable the grid becomes, even as demand for electricity spikes because customers are running their air-conditioning full throttle. Transmission lines sag, transformers explode, power plants fail. One 2016 study found the potential for cascading grid failures across Arizona to increase thirtyfold in response to a 1.8 degree rise in summer temperatures. “Most of the problems with the grid on hot days come from breakdowns at power plants or on the grid caused by the heat itself, or from the difficulty of meeting high demand for cooling,” Doug Lewin, a grid expert and author of the Texas Energy and Power newsletter, told me. The best way to fix that, Mr. Lewin argued, is to encourage people to reduce power demand in their homes with high efficiency heat pumps, better insulation and smart thermostats, and to generate their own power with solar panels and battery storage. The looming threat of a heat Katrina is a reminder of how technological progress creates new risks even as it solves old ones. On a brutally hot day during a recent trip to Jaipur, India, I visited an 18th-century building that had an indoor fountain, thick walls and a ventilation system to channel the wind through each room. There was no air-conditioning, but the building was as cool and comfortable as a new office tower in Houston. Air-conditioning may indeed be a modern necessity that many of us who live in hot parts of the world can’t survive without. But it is also a technology of forgetting. Once upon a time, people understood the dangers of extreme heat and designed ways to live with it. And now, as temperatures rise as a result of our hellbent consumption of fossil fuels, tens of thousands of lives may depend on remembering how that was done. Or finding better ways to do it.",recent thursday evening freakish windstorm called derecho spanish straight ahead hit houston city two million people also happens epicenter fossil fuel industry

nytimes,"As Voting Ends in India, Modi Awaits a Verdict on His 10 Years in Power","June 1, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/world/asia/india-election-modi.html,"Voting in India’s general election, a six-week-long referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decade in power, came to a close on Saturday as much of the country’s populous north was gripped by a deadly heat wave. Results will be tallied and announced on Tuesday. Mr. Modi, his power deeply entrenched, is seen as likely to win a third consecutive term as prime minister, which would make him only the second leader in India’s nearly 75 years as a republic to achieve that feat. Exit polls released after the last round of voting suggested a comfortable return for his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. A newly united opposition has put up a fight, rallying against Mr. Modi’s divisive politics and management of India’s deeply unequal economic growth. But the exit polls indicated it was struggling to significantly cut into the sizable majority in the 543-seat Parliament held by Mr. Modi’s party. In a message of thanks after the voting closed, Mr. Modi expressed confidence that “the people of India have voted in record numbers to re-elect” his government. But Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the largest opposition party, the Indian National Congress, played down the exit polls as “government surveys” and said the official results will show that his alliance was ahead. The election, held in phases over a month and a half, is the largest democratic exercise in the world, with more than 950 million eligible voters. The last stretch of the campaigning drew large rallies even as northern India baked under an intense heat wave, with temperatures frequently exceeding 110 degrees Fahrenheit, or more than 43 degrees Celsius. At least 19 poll workers have died from heat strokes or other health complications resulting from the heat in recent days. Elections in a parliamentary system like India’s are usually fought seat by seat, with a candidate’s fate determined by local economic and social factors. But the B.J.P. made its parliamentary campaign into a presidential-style referendum, putting the focus almost entirely on Mr. Modi and his leadership. The party hoped that Mr. Modi’s deep popularity would help it overcome a growing anti-incumbent sentiment 10 years into the B.J.P.’s rule. Mr. Modi held about 200 rallies across the country over more than two months of campaigning, hoping to lift up struggling candidates in his party. He also went on a media blitz, giving about 80 interviews to television stations and newspapers, almost all of them friendly to him. As the campaigning ended and a mandatory two-day election pause was set to begin, Mr. Modi retreated south to the memorial of one of India’s most celebrated monks for two days of meditation. The country’s media followed. The stream of videos and photos put out by his office, shot from multiple angles in a place where photography is usually not allowed, led the nightly news and television debates. Mr. Modi’s opponents cried foul, saying that the exercise amounted to prohibited campaigning — and that it exemplified the uneven playing field he has created. “The weather is good. The prime minister is sitting in meditation there and he has mellowed the sun goddess,” Ravi Kishan, an actor and B.J.P. candidate, told local media outlets. “This is historic — amidst intense heat, the wind started blowing today.” The opposition, hamstrung by arrests and other punitive actions as part of a crackdown, still mustered its most united front in years. Opposition leaders painted Mr. Modi as a friend to billionaires who has struggled to create jobs for the country’s large youth population. They called his party elitist, accusing it of not lifting up those in the middle and lower ends of India’s caste system. The opposition has stoked fears that if the B.J.P. remained in power, it might change the country’s Constitution to do away with affirmative action for middle and lower castes, a system put in place many decades ago to address centuries of oppression in India’s rigidly hierarchical society. Mr. Modi has vehemently rejected the charges as unfounded; the party under him has increased its outreach to lower castes. To try to keep his Hindu support base united, he turned to anti-Muslim rhetoric, leveling attacks that were unusually direct for him in recent years. The opposition has also tried to win over voters by promising a long list of welfare offerings, including the waiving of farmers’ loans, cash transfers for women and paid apprenticeships for the young. Mr. Modi, on the other hand, has stuck to an image of fiscal prudence, only highlighting his existing offerings. That, his party members say, was because he was confident of winning a third term, and he did not want to over-promise. But even though the opposition seemed to gain some traction, it faces an uphill task in unseating Mr. Modi’s government. He has built a huge electoral advantage with a robust and well-funded political machinery. In the last election, Mr. Modi’s party won 303 seats, nearly six times as many as its closest national competitor, the Indian National Congress party.",voting india general election sixweeklong referendum prime minister narendra modis decade power came close saturday much country populous north gripped deadly heat wave result tallied announced tuesday mr modi power deeply entrenched seen likely win third consecutive term prime minister would make second leader india nearly year republic achieve feat exit poll released last round voting suggested comfortable return hindunationalist bharatiya janata party bjp newly united opposition put fight rallying mr modis divisive politics management india deeply unequal economic growth exit poll indicated struggling significantly cut sizable majority seat parliament held mr modis party message thanks voting closed mr modi expressed confidence people india voted record number reelect government mallikarjun kharge president largest opposition party indian national congress played exit poll government survey said official result show alliance ahead election held phase month half largest democratic exercise world million eligible voter last stretch campaigning drew large rally even northern india baked intense heat wave temperature frequently exceeding degree fahrenheit degree celsius least poll worker died heat stroke health complication resulting heat recent day election parliamentary system like india usually fought seat seat candidate fate determined local economic social factor bjp made parliamentary campaign presidentialstyle referendum putting focus almost entirely mr modi leadership party hoped mr modis deep popularity would help overcome growing antiincumbent sentiment year bjps rule mr modi held rally across country two month campaigning hoping lift struggling candidate party also went medium blitz giving interview television station newspaper almost friendly campaigning ended mandatory twoday election pause set begin mr modi retreated south memorial one india celebrated monk two day meditation country medium followed stream video photo put office shot multiple angle place photography usually allowed led nightly news television debate mr modis opponent cried foul saying exercise amounted prohibited campaigning exemplified uneven playing field created weather good prime minister sitting meditation mellowed sun goddess ravi kishan actor bjp candidate told local medium outlet historic amidst intense heat wind started blowing today opposition hamstrung arrest punitive action part crackdown still mustered united front year opposition leader painted mr modi friend billionaire struggled create job country large youth population called party elitist accusing lifting middle lower end india caste system opposition stoked fear bjp remained power might change country constitution away affirmative action middle lower caste system put place many decade ago address century oppression india rigidly hierarchical society mr modi vehemently rejected charge unfounded party increased outreach lower caste try keep hindu support base united turned antimuslim rhetoric leveling attack unusually direct recent year opposition also tried win voter promising long list welfare offering including waiving farmer loan cash transfer woman paid apprenticeship young mr modi hand stuck image fiscal prudence highlighting existing offering party member say confident winning third term want overpromise even though opposition seemed gain traction face uphill task unseating mr modis government built huge electoral advantage robust wellfunded political machinery last election mr modis party seat nearly six time many closest national competitor indian national congress party
nytimes,A Small Army Combating a Flood of Deepfakes in India’s Election,"June 1, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/world/asia/india-election-deepfakes.html,"Through the middle of a high-stakes election being held during a mind-melting heat wave, a blizzard of confusing deepfakes blows across India. The variety seems endless: A.I.-powered mimicry, ventriloquy and deceptive editing effects. Some of it is crude, some jokey, some so obviously fake that it could never be expected to be seen as real. The overall effect is confounding, adding to a social media landscape already inundated with misinformation. The volume of online detritus is far too great for any election commission to track, let alone debunk. A diverse bunch of vigilante fact-checking outfits have sprung up to fill the breach. While the wheels of law grind slowly and unevenly, the job of tracking down deepfakes has been taken up by hundreds of government workers and private fact-checking groups based in India. “We have to be ready,” said Surya Sen, a forestry officer in the state of Karnataka who has been reassigned during the election to manage a team of 70 people hunting down deceptive A.I.-generated content. “Social media is a battleground this year.” When Mr. Sen’s team finds content they believe is illegal, they tell social media platforms to take it down, publicize the deception or even ask for criminal charges to filed. Celebrities have become familiar fodder for politically pointed tricks, including Ranveer Singh, a star in Hindi cinema. During a videotaped interview with an Indian news agency at the Ganges River in Varanasi, Mr. Singh praised the powerful prime minister, Narendra Modi, for celebrating “our rich cultural heritage.” But that is not what viewers heard when an altered version of the video, with a voice that sounded like Mr. Singh’s and a nearly perfect lip sync, made the rounds on social media. “We call these lip-sync deepfakes,” said Pamposh Raina, who leads the Deepfakes Analysis Unit, a collective of Indian media houses that opened a tip line on WhatsApp where people can send suspicious videos and audio to be scrutinized. She said the video of Mr. Singh was a typical example of authentic footage edited with an A.I.-cloned voice. The actor filed a complaint with the Mumbai police’s Cyber Crime Unit. In this election, no party has a monopoly on deceptive content. Another manipulated clip opened with authentic footage showing Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Modi’s most prominent opponent, partaking in the mundane ritual of swearing himself in as a candidate. Then it was layered with an A.I.-generated audio track. Mr. Gandhi did not actually resign from his party. This clip contains a personal dig, too, making Mr. Gandhi seem to say that he could “no longer pretend to be Hindu.” Mr. Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, which exit polls on Saturday showed had a comfortable lead, presents itself as a defender of the Hindu faith, and its opponents as traitors or impostors. Sometimes, political deepfakes veer into the supernatural. Dead politicians have a way of coming back to life via uncanny, A.I.-generated likenesses that endorse the real-life campaigns of their descendants. In a video that appeared a few days before voting began in April, a resurrected H. Vasanthakumar, who died of Covid-19 in 2020, spoke indirectly about his own death and blessed his son Vijay, who is running for his father’s former parliamentary seat in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. This apparition followed an example set by two other deceased titans of Tamil politics, Muthuvel Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa Jayaram. Mr. Modi’s government has been framing laws that are supposed to protect Indians from deepfakes and other kinds of misleading content. An “IT Rules” act of 2021 makes online platforms, unlike in the United States, responsible for all kinds of objectionable content, including impersonations intended to cause insult. The Internet Freedom Foundation, an Indian digital rights group, which has argued that these powers are far too broad, is tracking 17 legal challenges to the law. But the prime minister himself seems receptive to some kinds of A.I.-generated content. A pair of videos produced with A.I. tools show two of India’s biggest politicians, Mr. Modi and Mamata Banerjee, one of his staunchest opponents, emulating a viral YouTube video of the American rapper Lil Yachty doing “the HARDEST walk out EVER.” Mr. Modi shared the video on X, saying such creativity was “a delight.” Election officers like Mr. Sen in Karnataka called it political satire: “A Modi rock star is fine and not a violation. People know this is fake.” The police in West Bengal, where Ms. Banerjee is the chief minister, sent notices to some people for posting “offensive, malicious and inciting” content. On the hunt for deepfakes, Mr. Sen said his team in Karnataka, which works for a state government controlled by the opposition, vigilantly scrolls through social media platforms like Instagram and X, searching for keywords and repeatedly refreshing the accounts of popular influencers. The Deepfakes Analysis Unit has 12 fact-checking partners in the media, including a couple that are close to Mr. Modi’s national government. Ms. Raina said her unit works with external forensics labs, too, including one at the University of California, Berkeley. They use A.I.-detection software such as TrueMedia, which scans media files and determines whether they should be trusted. Some tech-savvy engineers are refining A.I.-forensic software to identify which portion of a video was manipulated, all the way down to individual pixels. Pratik Sinha, a founder of Alt News, the most venerable of India’s independent fact-checking sites, said that the possibilities of deepfakes had not yet been fully harnessed. Someday, he said, videos could show politicians not only saying things they did not say but also doing things they did not do. Dr. Hany Farid has been teaching digital forensics at Berkeley for 25 years and collaborates with the Deepfakes Analysis Unit on some cases. He said that while “we’re catching the bad deepfakes,” if more sophisticated fakes entered the arena, they might go undetected. In India as elsewhere, the arms race is on, between deepfakers and fact-checkers — fighting from all sides. Dr. Farid described this as “the first year I would say we have really started to see the impact of A.I. in interesting and more nefarious ways.”",middle highstakes election held mindmelting heat wave blizzard confusing deepfakes blow across india variety seems endless aipowered mimicry ventriloquy deceptive editing effect crude jokey obviously fake could never expected seen real overall effect confounding adding social medium landscape already inundated misinformation volume online detritus far great election commission track let alone debunk diverse bunch vigilante factchecking outfit sprung fill breach wheel law grind slowly unevenly job tracking deepfakes taken hundred government worker private factchecking group based india ready said surya sen forestry officer state karnataka reassigned election manage team people hunting deceptive aigenerated content social medium battleground year mr sen team find content believe illegal tell social medium platform take publicize deception even ask criminal charge filed celebrity become familiar fodder politically pointed trick including ranveer singh star hindi cinema videotaped interview indian news agency ganges river varanasi mr singh praised powerful prime minister narendra modi celebrating rich cultural heritage viewer heard altered version video voice sounded like mr singhs nearly perfect lip sync made round social medium call lipsync deepfakes said pamposh raina lead deepfakes analysis unit collective indian medium house opened tip line whatsapp people send suspicious video audio scrutinized said video mr singh typical example authentic footage edited aicloned voice actor filed complaint mumbai police cyber crime unit election party monopoly deceptive content another manipulated clip opened authentic footage showing rahul gandhi mr modis prominent opponent partaking mundane ritual swearing candidate layered aigenerated audio track mr gandhi actually resign party clip contains personal dig making mr gandhi seem say could longer pretend hindu mr modis governing bharatiya janata party exit poll saturday showed comfortable lead present defender hindu faith opponent traitor impostor sometimes political deepfakes veer supernatural dead politician way coming back life via uncanny aigenerated likeness endorse reallife campaign descendant video appeared day voting began april resurrected h vasanthakumar died covid spoke indirectly death blessed son vijay running father former parliamentary seat southern state tamil nadu apparition followed example set two deceased titan tamil politics muthuvel karunanidhi jayalalithaa jayaram mr modis government framing law supposed protect indian deepfakes kind misleading content rule act make online platform unlike united state responsible kind objectionable content including impersonation intended cause insult internet freedom foundation indian digital right group argued power far broad tracking legal challenge law prime minister seems receptive kind aigenerated content pair video produced ai tool show two india biggest politician mr modi mamata banerjee one staunchest opponent emulating viral youtube video american rapper lil yachty hardest walk ever mr modi shared video x saying creativity delight election officer like mr sen karnataka called political satire modi rock star fine violation people know fake police west bengal m banerjee chief minister sent notice people posting offensive malicious inciting content hunt deepfakes mr sen said team karnataka work state government controlled opposition vigilantly scroll social medium platform like instagram x searching keywords repeatedly refreshing account popular influencers deepfakes analysis unit factchecking partner medium including couple close mr modis national government m raina said unit work external forensics lab including one university california berkeley use aidetection software truemedia scan medium file determines whether trusted techsavvy engineer refining aiforensic software identify portion video manipulated way individual pixel pratik sinha founder alt news venerable india independent factchecking site said possibility deepfakes yet fully harnessed someday said video could show politician saying thing say also thing dr hany farid teaching digital forensics berkeley year collaborates deepfakes analysis unit case said catching bad deepfakes sophisticated fake entered arena might go undetected india elsewhere arm race deepfakers factcheckers fighting side dr farid described first year would say really started see impact ai interesting nefarious way
nytimes,"Birubala Rabha, Who Battled Witch Hunting in India, Dies at 75","May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/world/asia/birubala-rabha-dead.html,"Birubala Rabha, an Indian social activist who fought the practice of branding women as witches in the country’s remote northeast, died on May 13 in Guwahati, the capital of Assam State in that region. She was 75. Her death, in a hospital, was caused by cancer, her assistant, Usha Rabha, said in an interview. (They were not related.) So-called witch hunting has been a scourge throughout India, preying on mostly village women who are often single, widowed or otherwise isolated and involved in property or marital disputes. Accused of being witches, they have been tortured and in many cases murdered; from 2010 to 2021, more than 1,500 were killed in India, according to the country’s National Crime Records Bureau. Ms. Rabha, a slight, bespectacled woman who was born poor in an Assam village, faced down mobs for her work, badgered the police and pushed for legal protection for women. Her efforts were rewarded when legislation outlawing witch hunting was passed in Assam State in 2015. Cases there have dropped sharply, to a few per year from the several a month that were being reported when she began her campaign in the early 2000s, said Usha Rabha, who worked at Mission Birubala, the nongovernmental organization that Birubala Rabha founded. The victims of witch hunts face gruesome punishments, according to “Contemporary Practices of Witch Hunting,” a 2015 report by the Indian legal nonprofit Partners for Law in Development. They can be subjected to “forcible stripping,” the report said, “being paraded naked in public, cutting or tonsuring of the hair, blackening of the face, cutting off of the nose, pulling of the teeth to ‘defang’, gouging out the eye, whipping, gang rape, forcible consumption of human excreta, cow dung” or “killing by hanging, hacking, lynching or burying alive.” Ms. Rabha traveled from village to village in Assam to speak out against the practice and declared that there was no such thing as “daini,” or witches. She had long been suspicious of folk superstitions and of medicine men who chanted incantations over young women to drive out what they believed were evil spirits. As a young mother, Ms. Rabha was told by a local medicine man that her mentally ill son would soon die; he didn’t. That false prediction, in the 1980s, was the seed for her advocacy work, which she began in earnest around 2000. That year, she stood up in a meeting in the village of Lakhipur, also in Assam, to support five women accused of being witches; she didn’t back down when hundreds of villagers surrounded her house the next day. Usha Rabha recalled her first rescue mission with Ms. Rabha, in 2006, when a stick-bearing mob encircled them in a neighboring state. “I was terrified,” she said. But Birubala was “completely unfazed,” Ms. Rabha said. When the police came to rescue the two women, she said, Birubala “reprimanded the cops, saying, ‘I will not stop until I finish the work that I do.’” In Assam, in the 2000s, Birubala Rabha became allied with the state’s former police director general, Kuladhar Saikia. “She would come to me, meet me and discuss these issues,” Mr. Saikia recalled in an interview, adding, “She told me she was standing up against social injustice.” “She was a courageous lady,” he said. “When I was looking for someone to stand up against injustice, they were few. What she accomplished, this village lady, it was quite praiseworthy.” But when she began her campaign, she was quite isolated, as she recalled in a 2016 interview for a New York Times video about her work. “When I started fighting against witch hunts, villagers came in packs to beat me up and kill me,” she told the filmmaker and journalist Vikram Singh, who made the video. “The police did not help us earlier.” She added, “My own relatives called me a witch after my husband died of cancer.” Birubala Rabha was born on Feb. 5, 1949, in the village of Thakurvila, in Assam’s Goalpara district. Her father, Kaliya Rabha, a farmer, died when she was 6. Her mother, Sagarbala Rabha, was a farmworker. Birubala, who had only a grade-school education, married a farmer at 15. She is survived by three sons, Dharmeshwar, Bishnu Prasad and Dayalu, and a daughter, Kumuli Rabha. In 2021, Ms. Rabha was given the Padma Shri, a civilian award, by the Indian government. She was buried with state honors in her village in Goalpara. Over her career, she rescued 90 women both personally and through her organization, Mission Birubala. “Her legacy of scientific principles and progressive societal contributions will serve as a beacon, inspiring future generations to fearlessly combat injustice,” Assam’s minister for public health engineering, Jayanta Mallabaruah, wrote on X. Ms. Rabha had seen too much suffering by women to be impressed by the accolades and awards she received late in her life. “It feels better to save lives than to win awards,” she told Mr. Singh in the 2016 video.",birubala rabha indian social activist fought practice branding woman witch country remote northeast died may guwahati capital assam state region death hospital caused cancer assistant usha rabha said interview related socalled witch hunting scourge throughout india preying mostly village woman often single widowed otherwise isolated involved property marital dispute accused witch tortured many case murdered killed india according country national crime record bureau m rabha slight bespectacled woman born poor assam village faced mob work badgered police pushed legal protection woman effort rewarded legislation outlawing witch hunting passed assam state case dropped sharply per year several month reported began campaign early said usha rabha worked mission birubala nongovernmental organization birubala rabha founded victim witch hunt face gruesome punishment according contemporary practice witch hunting report indian legal nonprofit partner law development subjected forcible stripping report said paraded naked public cutting tonsuring hair blackening face cutting nose pulling teeth defang gouging eye whipping gang rape forcible consumption human excreta cow dung killing hanging hacking lynching burying alive m rabha traveled village village assam speak practice declared thing daini witch long suspicious folk superstition medicine men chanted incantation young woman drive believed evil spirit young mother m rabha told local medicine man mentally ill son would soon die didnt false prediction seed advocacy work began earnest around year stood meeting village lakhipur also assam support five woman accused witch didnt back hundred villager surrounded house next day usha rabha recalled first rescue mission m rabha stickbearing mob encircled neighboring state terrified said birubala completely unfazed m rabha said police came rescue two woman said birubala reprimanded cop saying stop finish work assam birubala rabha became allied state former police director general kuladhar saikia would come meet discus issue mr saikia recalled interview adding told standing social injustice courageous lady said looking someone stand injustice accomplished village lady quite praiseworthy began campaign quite isolated recalled interview new york time video work started fighting witch hunt villager came pack beat kill told filmmaker journalist vikram singh made video police help u earlier added relative called witch husband died cancer birubala rabha born feb village thakurvila assam goalpara district father kaliya rabha farmer died mother sagarbala rabha farmworker birubala gradeschool education married farmer survived three son dharmeshwar bishnu prasad dayalu daughter kumuli rabha m rabha given padma shri civilian award indian government buried state honor village goalpara career rescued woman personally organization mission birubala legacy scientific principle progressive societal contribution serve beacon inspiring future generation fearlessly combat injustice assam minister public health engineering jayanta mallabaruah wrote x m rabha seen much suffering woman impressed accolade award received late life feel better save life win award told mr singh video
nytimes,"Overlooked No More: Hansa Mehta, Who Fought for Women’s Equality in India and Beyond","May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/obituaries/hansa-mehta-overlooked.html,"This article is part of Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times. Human rights has long been considered a Western concept, but recent scholarship has been uncovering the influence of women from the global south. Women like Hansa Mehta. Mehta stood up against the British government during India’s struggle for independence. She campaigned for women’s social and political equality and their right to an education. And she fought for her ideals during the framing of the constitution for a newly independent India. For Mehta, women’s rights were human rights. This conviction was best exemplified at a 1947 meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, to which she had been appointed as one of just two women delegates, alongside Eleanor Roosevelt. Mehta boldly objected to the wording of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the commission was tasked with framing. It read: “All men are born free and equal in dignity and rights, they are endowed by nature with reason and conscience, and should act towards one another like brothers.” Mehta pointed out that the phrase “all men” was out of date and could be interpreted to exclude women. Roosevelt countered that the use of the word “men” was “generally accepted to include all human beings,” according to minutes of the meeting. But Mehta — a soft-spoken, slight woman who dressed in traditional saris — held her ground, insisting that the language should be changed to “human beings.” The declaration was adopted with her suggestion the next year, and it has been used as the foundation for treaties around the world. Two years earlier, Mehta was one of three women who drafted the Indian Women’s Charter of Rights and Duties, which affirmed that women have equal rights to education, suffrage, pay and distribution of property, as well as the same rights as men in marriage and divorce. When the panel that became the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in 1946 was forming its guiding principles, it turned to her ideas. In her work for the U.N., as in all her endeavors, Mehta took women’s participation in public and political realms to new heights. Hansa Mehta was born on July 3, 1897, in Surat (now in the northwestern state of Gujarat), to Harshadagauri and Manubhai Mehta. Her father, Manubhai, was a philosophy professor at Baroda College (now Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda); he later became the prime minister of the state of Baroda. Hansa’s paternal grandfather, Nandshankar Mehta, was headmaster of an English-language school, a civil servant and the author of the historical novel “Karan Ghelo”(1866), about the 13th-century ruler of Gujarat whose foolishness resulted in the loss of his kingdom. It is considered the first novel written in the Gujarati language. “I was fortunate enough to be born in a family which had liberal ideas on all questions of life,” Mehta said in 1972 in an oral history at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library in New Delhi. At a time when she estimated that only 2 percent of Indian women were literate, Mehta attended a high school for girls that had been set up by Baroda’s progressive ruler. She read widely, including novels by Sir Walter Scott and James Fenimore Cooper. She was one of a handful of young women to receive a bachelor’s degree, hers in philosophy, from Baroda College. Mehta continued her education in England, where she met the poet and political activist Sarojini Naidu. Naidu took her under her wing and brought her to the International Woman Suffrage Alliance conference in Geneva in 1920. Naidu “made me do things I otherwise would not have dreamt of doing,” like speaking in public, Mehta wrote in “Indian Woman,” a 1981 collection of her essays. In 1923, she traveled alone to the United States, a rare undertaking for women at the time, and visited colleges and universities to learn about American women’s education. She met Mohandas K. Gandhi when he was in jail in India in the 1920s, and in 1930 she responded to his call for women to join the freedom movement. She picketed stores that sold English rather than Indian-made cloth and helped lead protests, landing in jail three times. As a founder of the All India Women’s Conference, and later its president, Mehta tied the political struggle for India’s independence with the fight to improve the condition of her countrywomen. “If we wish to build up a democratic state, it will not pay the state to keep half the number of its citizens uneducated,” she wrote in “Indian Woman.” But she opposed special quotas; she wanted to level the playing field between men and women. Mehta was appointed to the Commission on the Status of Women in 1946 and to the Commission on Human Rights in 1947 — the same year that India gained its independence — and served until 1952. In 1946, she was one of about 15 women to join India’s Constituent Assembly, which met to write a constitution for the new nation. As an assembly member she lobbied for a civil code that would eventually supersede religious laws and ensure gender equality, and she strengthened the language on what are known as “directive principles” — guidelines that are unenforceable by the courts but nonetheless crucial in governing a multiethnic and multireligious secular democracy. In 1924, Mehta married Jivraj Mehta (a common surname in India), the chief medical officer in Baroda. The marriage was regarded as controversial because he was of a lower caste. She said in her oral history that her own community wanted to expel her from her caste, “but then I told them I was going out of the caste myself, as I did not believe in caste.” She and her husband had two children. He became the first chief minister of Gujarat in 1960 and, in 1963, the Indian high commissioner to the United Kingdom, a post equivalent to an ambassadorship. Mehta was vice chancellor of the Shreemati Nathibai Damodar Thackersey Women’s University (commonly known as S.N.D.T.) from 1946 to 1948 and vice chancellor of the University of Baroda from 1949 to 1958. At Baroda, she was the first woman to hold that title at an Indian coed university. The library there is named after her. In 2021, the U.N. held the inaugural Dr. Hansa Mehta Dialogue, a discussion on the fundamental importance of women’s empowerment. Throughout her life, Mehta wrote essays and translated stories and plays into Gujarati. She died at 98 on April 4, 1995. In the oral history, when she was asked why India, although it was largely conservative in its attitude toward women, had more women in the public and political sphere than many Western nations, Mehta spoke of Shakti, the female personification of divine power. “Historical reasons,” she replied, “because from the beginning we have always considered woman as a competent person. ‘Shakti’ — she is always worshiped as ‘Shakti.’” Radha Vatsal’s historical novel “No. 10 Doyers Street,” about a woman journalist from India who becomes embroiled in the case of a Chinatown gangster in 1900s New York,

nytimes,A Matter of Survival as South Asia’s Heat Wave Reaches 127 Degrees,"May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/world/asia/pakistan-india-heat-wave.html,"As South Asia bakes under a blistering heat wave, life-or-death decisions arrive with the midday sun. Abideen Khan and his 10-year-old son need every penny of the $3.50 a day they can make molding mud into bricks at a kiln under the open sky in Jacobabad, a city in southern Pakistan. But as temperatures have soared as high as 126 degrees Fahrenheit, or 52 degrees Celsius, in recent days, they have been forced to stop by 1 p.m., cutting their earnings in half. “This isn’t heat,” said Mr. Khan, sweat dripping down his face and soaking through his worn clothes. “It’s a punishment, maybe from God.” It is yet another brutal summer in the age of climate change, in a part of the world that is among the most vulnerable to its dire effects. And there is more suffering to come: The extreme heat that Pakistan and neighboring India have been experiencing will continue for days or weeks, forecasters say. Already, it has exacted a deadly toll. In the northern Indian state of Bihar, officials said that at least 14 people had died from the heat. Reports from other states in India’s north indicate that the count could be considerably higher. In both India and Pakistan, hospitals have reported large numbers of heatstroke cases. Ten of those who have died in Bihar were poll workers preparing for the voting to be held in the state on Saturday, the final day of India’s national election. To mitigate the heat, glucose and electrolytes are being distributed to polling officers, tents are being erected to provide shade and earthenware pots will provide cool water. In the state of Uttar Pradesh, at least six election security workers have died. New Delhi, where temperatures have approached 122 this week, nearly 20 degrees above normal, recorded its first official heat-related death of the year on Wednesday. In Jacobabad, long regarded as one of the hottest places on earth, the temperature reached 126 degrees on Sunday, with highs of 124 each of the following three days. About 75 miles away, the Pakistani town of Mohenjo Daro, notable for its Indus Valley civilization sites from 2500 B.C., reached 127 degrees on Sunday, just shy of a record set in 2010. The blazing temperatures compound the challenges for Pakistan, a country of 241 million people that is already grappling with economic and political turmoil. For the more than one million people who live in the Jacobabad district, life is dominated by constant efforts to find ways to cope with the heat. Blackouts lasting 12 to 20 hours a day are common, and some villages lack electricity altogether. The absence of necessities like readily available water and proper housing exacerbates the suffering. Most residents cannot afford air-conditioning or alternatives, like Chinese-made solar power batteries and chargeable fans. A solar panel to run two fans and a lightbulb costs about a month’s wages for laborers in Jacobabad. The water crisis is so severe that donkeys can be seen on the streets carrying tanks, from which residents buy enough water to fill five small plastic jerrycans for $1. Soaring demand has pushed up the price of ice, making this essential commodity even harder to find. Many of the poor have no choice but to work outside. Rice, the lifeblood of Pakistan’s agriculture, demands backbreaking labor in the fields from May to July, the hottest months. For Sahiba, a 25-year-old farmworker who uses one name, each day starts before dawn. She cooks for her family, then walks for miles with other women to reach the fields, where they toil until afternoon under the relentless sun. Nine months pregnant with her 10th child, she carries a double burden. “If we take a day or half-day break, there’s no daily wage, which means my children go hungry that night,” Ms. Sahiba said. Each summer, 25 to 30 percent of the district’s population becomes temporary climate refugees, according to community activists. Some seek refuge in Quetta, a city 185 miles north, where the heat is more bearable. Others go to the port city of Karachi, 310 miles south, which has had its own deadly heat waves but offers some relief with its less frequent blackouts. “Those who can afford it may rent houses in cooler cities, but most residents are simply too poor. They struggle to survive under makeshift tents erected in the open sky,” said Jan Odhano, head of the Community Development Foundation, a Jacobabad-based organization that helps the poor cope with the heat. Jansher Khoso, a 38-year-old garment worker, knows this struggle all too well. In 2018, his mother went to the hospital with heatstroke as temperatures spiked in Jacobabad. Now, every April, he sends his family to Quetta, where they remain until the autumn, while he works in Karachi. But this comes at a steep price. “I work for 16 hours in Karachi to afford the expense of this temporary migration,” Mr. Khoso said, “because I don’t want any of my family members to die in the cruel heat of Jacobabad.” Jacobabad’s suffering has not been limited to high temperatures. In 2022, monsoon rains and devastating floods — linked to erratic weather patterns associated with climate change — submerged the district and about a third of Pakistan overall, killing at least 1,700 people. The heat is nothing new in the city, which was named after John Jacob, a British brigadier general who experienced its harsh climate firsthand in the 19th century. Leading a small force to quell rebel tribes and bandits, General Jacob lost a lieutenant and seven soldiers to the heat on the first day of a 10-mile march. His diary described the wind as “a blast from the furnace” even at night. To cope with the hostile climate, General Jacob introduced an irrigation system and built three canals to supply fresh river water to residents. Today, the canals are dry and full of garbage.",south asia bakes blistering heat wave lifeordeath decision arrive midday sun abideen khan yearold son need every penny day make molding mud brick kiln open sky jacobabad city southern pakistan temperature soared high degree fahrenheit degree celsius recent day forced stop pm cutting earnings half isnt heat said mr khan sweat dripping face soaking worn clothes punishment maybe god yet another brutal summer age climate change part world among vulnerable dire effect suffering come extreme heat pakistan neighboring india experiencing continue day week forecaster say already exacted deadly toll northern indian state bihar official said least people died heat report state india north indicate count could considerably higher india pakistan hospital reported large number heatstroke case ten died bihar poll worker preparing voting held state saturday final day india national election mitigate heat glucose electrolyte distributed polling officer tent erected provide shade earthenware pot provide cool water state uttar pradesh least six election security worker died new delhi temperature approached week nearly degree normal recorded first official heatrelated death year wednesday jacobabad long regarded one hottest place earth temperature reached degree sunday high following three day mile away pakistani town mohenjo daro notable indus valley civilization site bc reached degree sunday shy record set blazing temperature compound challenge pakistan country million people already grappling economic political turmoil one million people live jacobabad district life dominated constant effort find way cope heat blackout lasting hour day common village lack electricity altogether absence necessity like readily available water proper housing exacerbates suffering resident afford airconditioning alternative like chinesemade solar power battery chargeable fan solar panel run two fan lightbulb cost month wage laborer jacobabad water crisis severe donkey seen street carrying tank resident buy enough water fill five small plastic jerrycans soaring demand pushed price ice making essential commodity even harder find many poor choice work outside rice lifeblood pakistan agriculture demand backbreaking labor field may july hottest month sahiba yearold farmworker us one name day start dawn cook family walk mile woman reach field toil afternoon relentless sun nine month pregnant th child carry double burden take day halfday break there daily wage mean child go hungry night m sahiba said summer percent district population becomes temporary climate refugee according community activist seek refuge quetta city mile north heat bearable others go port city karachi mile south deadly heat wave offer relief le frequent blackout afford may rent house cooler city resident simply poor struggle survive makeshift tent erected open sky said jan odhano head community development foundation jacobabadbased organization help poor cope heat jansher khoso yearold garment worker know struggle well mother went hospital heatstroke temperature spiked jacobabad every april sends family quetta remain autumn work karachi come steep price work hour karachi afford expense temporary migration mr khoso said dont want family member die cruel heat jacobabad jacobabads suffering limited high temperature monsoon rain devastating flood linked erratic weather pattern associated climate change submerged district third pakistan overall killing least people heat nothing new city named john jacob british brigadier general experienced harsh climate firsthand th century leading small force quell rebel tribe bandit general jacob lost lieutenant seven soldier heat first day mile march diary described wind blast furnace even night cope hostile climate general jacob introduced irrigation system built three canal supply fresh river water resident today canal dry full garbage
nytimes,"Wall Street Lands on India, Looking for Profits It Can’t Find in China","May 31, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/business/india-foreign-investors.html,"Mumbai, India’s financial capital, has seen a lot of new faces over the past year. The heads of global banks have been trooping through, visiting its stock exchanges, buying property and hiring new staff. A postpandemic boom has pushed the value of India’s stock market to about $5 trillion, putting it neck and neck with Hong Kong’s. India’s economy is among the fastest growing in the world. Wall Street can’t ignore India anymore. The point of entry is Mumbai, a port city of 26 million people, counting its suburbs. Mumbai has been given a makeover: Suspension bridges span its seaways, as well as its infamous slums, and new metro lines have been carved beneath its Art Deco and Indo-Saracenic facades and rumbling commuter railways. Mumbai has been India’s commercial hub for eight decades, but it was relatively unfamiliar to global finance until the past two years. Now North American pension managers, sovereign wealth funds from the Persian Gulf and Singapore, Japanese banks and private equity firms are clamoring for a piece of India’s growth. Old hands and novices alike can rattle off reasons India’s rise is inevitable. Making money will be easier said than done, not least because Indian investors got here first. Compared with Indian companies’ current profits, their stock prices are high. Foreign investors have yet to throw in their full financial weight. Mumbai’s markets were jittery in May, as Narendra Modi, the pro-business prime minister, fought for re-election. He is expected to win, but uncertainties have made far-flung investors feel cautious. Despite all the hot money pouring into the Mumbai markets, India remains a tricky place for foreign companies to navigate, making direct investment risky. Demand for spending by India’s potentially vast base of consumers has been lagging expectations — the top of the income ladder is spending more than ever, while hundreds of millions of people are stuck near the bottom. The simple reason for investors’ enthusiasm is India’s economy, which has strengths other big emerging economies are currently lacking. Foreign clients, an Indian bank executive said, “gravitate to India because it is showing reliable growth, its currency is stable, it’s showing fiscal discipline.” He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he works closely with the government. If India looks better to global investors, China and Russia look worse. China’s miraculous growth engine is sputtering, after three decades at full throttle, with threats of trade wars becoming routine. And Russia was effectively crossed off some lists of viable emerging economies after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the sanctions imposed on it by the United States, Europe and their allies. That is one reason, the banker said, investors pushed Wall Street to make it easier to bet big sums of money on India. The MSCI, an influential stock index of emerging markets started by Morgan Stanley, has increased India’s weighting to more than 18 percent, from 8 percent in 2020, while reducing China’s representation. It’s not just stocks: In June, JPMorgan Chase will add Indian government bonds to its emerging-markets index. Both changes mean that mutual funds are buying more Indian financial assets. Aashish Agarwal, India country head for the investment bank Jefferies, has been doing deals in Mumbai for more than 20 years. He said the case for investing in India was a no-brainer: Indian stocks are outperforming China’s. India’s markets also draw on a wider range of companies than many other emerging economies, he said. “You can’t think of Korea without Samsung, or Latin America without commodities,” Mr. Agarwal said. “India, as an index, is arguably the most balanced you might find outside of the U.S.” The view looks equally sunny to Kevin Carter from Lafayette, Calif. He founded an investment firm, called EMQQ Global, that sells exchange-traded funds, which make it easy for ordinary people to invest in emerging markets. The value of one fund that focuses on India’s internet and e-commerce sectors has grown nearly 40 percent in the past year. India, he said, has the makings of what historically has helped emerging markets to succeed: a large population, especially of young people, and economic growth that is causing people to spend more. With 1.4 billion people and counting, India is the world’s most populous country. Most Indians are working age or will be soon, unlike residents of Europe or East Asia. India’s economic growth rate, which hovered around 7 percent for the past couple of years, has compared favorably with a world average of 3.2 percent. On Friday, on the eve of the election’s last day, India’s central bank delivered a happy surprise. Growth in the most recent quarter was even higher than economists expected, giving the past fiscal year an official rate of 8.2 percent. Still, for some investors, there is an air of déjà vu. They remember a time almost 15 years ago when India was last thought to be ready to overtake China’s rate of economic growth. Those who bought the India hype then ended up disappointed. From 2008 to 2020, China’s per-capita income quadrupled while India’s grew by 2.5 times. That left India poor compared with the rest of the world. The latest calculation by the International Monetary Fund placed India at 138 in national rankings of income, between the Republic of Congo and Nicaragua. China was in 65th place. But India is moving up, a lot faster than China can. Along the way, India is spending heavily on public infrastructure, a hallmark of Mr. Modi’s policies in 10 years in office. In Mumbai itself, there were just three skyscrapers in 2008 — it will have sprouted hundreds by the end of this year. The city’s center of gravity has shifted from its downtown to the purpose-built Bandra Kurla Complex, or BKC, a midtown sprawl of concrete spaghetti. The One BKC tower, home to Bank of America and Switzerland’s insurance giant Swiss Re, as well as many others, was bought by Blackstone, the world’s biggest private-equity group, for a reported $300 million in 2019. Mumbai, of course, is also home to the stock market, which has attracted the savings of India’s own rapidly expanding investor class. Banks have made it easier for middle-income Indian families to invest directly. So many newbie investors have lost money on the risky trading of derivatives — investment securities tied to other securities — that the regulators want to rein them back in. A stiffer test for India’s economy will be whether it can draw more foreign direct investment — the buying up of whole chunks of private businesses by investors or companies. Nivruti Rai, managing director of Invest India, a joint venture between the commerce ministry and private chambers of commerce, is trying to ease the way. Ms. Rai is well positioned for the job, having spent nearly 30 years at Intel, spanning India and America. “I am a woman, I come from tech, from a multinational,” she said, “and I’m based in India. All this sends a message.” More longer-term foreign funding would help strengthen and stabilize the Indian rupee. Investors who make such financial commitments also tend to bring technical expertise. “We may be missing on capital and, in some places, we may be missing on technology,” she said. Ms. Rai has a lofty target — $100 billion in foreign direct investment. That’s higher than what India drew in 2021, which was a record, and much higher than it is now. The inflow sank 16.8 percent last year to just over $28 billion. Foreign investment shrank in many spots around the world in 2023, but India, like China, was hit especially hard. Ms. Rai nonetheless foresees a new cycle of investment activity centered on Indian companies in health care technology, clean energy and artificial intelligence. Mr. Modi has promised a tenfold increase in India’s economy by 2047, in time for the 100th anniversary of its independence. To get there, Ms. Rai noted, the country will need an even faster rate of growth, and that means more of “these investors that we’re trying to draw in.”",mumbai india financial capital seen lot new

nytimes,"Millions of Indians Living Abroad Have a Say in the Election, Even if They Can’t Vote","May 30, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/world/asia/india-election-diaspora-expats.html,"The dishes at a community center potluck for Indian expatriates near Washington, D.C., ranged from chana masala, a popular northern Indian chickpea curry, to idli, a southern Indian rice cake. The guests’ views on India’s general election were equally varied. Some praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic achievements. Supporters of candidates challenging Mr. Modi’s party criticized what they saw as his disregard for minorities and democratic norms. “What is the vision for India in 2024?” the host, Somu Kumar, a manager at a cloud computing company, said recently of that winter potluck. “That gets a lot of people excited to talk.” India’s 35 million-member diaspora, roughly equivalent in population to Delhi’s metropolitan area, represents a tiny minority compared with the nearly one billion people who are eligible to take part in a six-week voting process that ends on Saturday. Expatriate Indians also cannot cast absentee ballots under India’s electoral laws. But the diaspora is heavily courted by India’s main political parties. Many of its members are from the country’s political and business elites, and voters back home want to know what they think. “When a person is abroad, people take interest and believe what they say is right,” said Adapa Prasad, the president of the American branch of Mr. Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The result, he said, is that the 10,000 or so B.J.P. volunteers in the United States alone can reach tens of thousands of voters. This spring, Indians around the world have been hosting gatherings and rallies for their preferred political parties. Many Indians abroad are proud of India’s rise and associate Mr. Modi with it. So much of the recent activity has supported his bid for a third term. In the United States, which the Indian government says is home to more than five million people of Indian origin, there have been pro-Modi rallies at Times Square, the Washington Monument, the Golden Gate Bridge and other landmarks. “Save India,” some of the pro-Modi posters said. Pro-Modi groups have also set up phone banks and held other events. In a Chicago suburb last month, Modi supporters wearing the B.J.P.’s saffron tassels lit a bonfire next to a Hindu school as part of a sacred fire ritual. India’s Hindu majority is a key constituency for Mr. Modi, who has been criticized for normalizing Hindu-nationalist policies in a country born as a secular republic. In Australia, a caravan of cars draped in saffron flags stretched for miles through Sydney in April. In Germany, Modi supporters who own restaurants in Berlin and Munich have been hosting gatherings for B.J.P. supporters, said Arun Varma, an entrepreneur who founded an e-commerce brand there. And in Britain, people have been visiting Hindu temples, as well as mosques and churches, to offer prayers for Mr. Modi’s electoral success, said Neil Lal, the chairman and president of the Indian Council of Scotland and the United Kingdom. “The election is the talk of the town,” Mr. Lal said from London. Mr. Modi has actively cultivated the diaspora’s support over the years, in part by filling stadiums around the world for rallies. A 2020 study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think tank in Washington, found that a majority of Indians abroad supported him over his rivals. Milan Vaishnav, a political scientist at Carnegie who studies India’s diaspora, said that expatriate Indians were a marginal force in Indian politics and that their campaign donations, while difficult to quantify, were small compared with the billions of dollars raised at home. “But gatherings of the diaspora have helped the B.J.P. create an image of global popularity,” he said. The B.J.P. isn’t the only party active outside India. The overseas arm of its main rival, the Indian National Congress, organizes events, distributes campaign posters and helps to place columns in newspapers. The Aam Aadmi Party, which is part of a parliamentary coalition led by the Congress Party, has overseas members who run phone banks and spread friendly memes about its candidates. Mr. Kumar, an Aam Aadmi supporter, said there was growing concern in the diaspora about a potential third Modi term. He said expatriates watching India worry about the recent marginalization of religious minorities, the assassination of a separatist and the jailings of opposition politicians. Some of the people who attend his potlucks, many of whom he plays cricket with, are stalwart Modi backers. Others are onetime Modi supporters who now question whether he should be re-elected. “I hope this also translates back toward India,” Mr. Kumar said. Outside of the main parties, independent activists who live abroad have criticized the government in ways that would be difficult in India, where Mr. Modi’s government has cracked down on dissent and jailed opposition leaders. One of those activists, Suresh Ediga, an Indian expatriate in New Jersey, organizes meetings on election reform and runs a blog that fact checks Indian politicians. “Independent institutions have collapsed under Modi,” he said. “That is more alarming than anything else.” While many in the diaspora have thrown themselves into campaigning, others have taken a more hands-off approach. Lion Hina Trivedi, a prominent social worker from Gujarat, the Indian state where Mr. Modi served as chief minister from 2001 to 2014, has known him for decades and met him on his trips to Washington. She said that after more than 45 years in Chicago, she was now more invested in her American community. But she still urges the Indians she knows to travel back home to vote, recalling her father’s advice: “Never forget about India.” “You should go,” she tells them. “Your voice matters.”",dish community center potluck indian expatriate near washington dc ranged chana masala popular northern indian chickpea curry idli southern indian rice cake guest view india general election equally varied praised prime minister narendra modis economic achievement supporter candidate challenging mr modis party criticized saw disregard minority democratic norm vision india host somu kumar manager cloud computing company said recently winter potluck get lot people excited talk india millionmember diaspora roughly equivalent population delhi metropolitan area represents tiny minority compared nearly one billion people eligible take part sixweek voting process end saturday expatriate indian also cast absentee ballot india electoral law diaspora heavily courted india main political party many member country political business elite voter back home want know think person abroad people take interest believe say right said adapa prasad president american branch mr modis ruling bharatiya janata party result said bjp volunteer united state alone reach ten thousand voter spring indian around world hosting gathering rally preferred political party many indian abroad proud india rise associate mr modi much recent activity supported bid third term united state indian government say home five million people indian origin promodi rally time square washington monument golden gate bridge landmark save india promodi poster said promodi group also set phone bank held event chicago suburb last month modi supporter wearing bjps saffron tassel lit bonfire next hindu school part sacred fire ritual india hindu majority key constituency mr modi criticized normalizing hindunationalist policy country born secular republic australia caravan car draped saffron flag stretched mile sydney april germany modi supporter restaurant berlin munich hosting gathering bjp supporter said arun varma entrepreneur founded ecommerce brand britain people visiting hindu temple well mosque church offer prayer mr modis electoral success said neil lal chairman president indian council scotland united kingdom election talk town mr lal said london mr modi actively cultivated diaspora support year part filling stadium around world rally study carnegie endowment international peace think tank washington found majority indian abroad supported rival milan vaishnav political scientist carnegie study india diaspora said expatriate indian marginal force indian politics campaign donation difficult quantify small compared billion dollar raised home gathering diaspora helped bjp create image global popularity said bjp isnt party active outside india overseas arm main rival indian national congress organizes event distributes campaign poster help place column newspaper aam aadmi party part parliamentary coalition led congress party overseas member run phone bank spread friendly meme candidate mr kumar aam aadmi supporter said growing concern diaspora potential third modi term said expatriate watching india worry recent marginalization religious minority assassination separatist jailings opposition politician people attend potluck many play cricket stalwart modi backer others onetime modi supporter question whether reelected hope also translates back toward india mr kumar said outside main party independent activist live abroad criticized government way would difficult india mr modis government cracked dissent jailed opposition leader one activist suresh ediga indian expatriate new jersey organizes meeting election reform run blog fact check indian politician independent institution collapsed modi said alarming anything else many diaspora thrown campaigning others taken handsoff approach lion hina trivedi prominent social worker gujarat indian state mr modi served chief minister known decade met trip washington said year chicago invested american community still urge indian know travel back home vote recalling father advice never forget india go tell voice matter
nytimes,New Delhi Sweats Through Its Hottest Recorded Day,"May 29, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/world/asia/india-delhi-hottest-day-ever.html,"New Delhi recorded its highest temperature ever measured on Wednesday — 126 degrees Fahrenheit, or 52.3 degrees Celsius — leaving residents of the Indian capital sweltering in a heat wave that has kept temperatures in several Indian states well above 110 degrees for weeks. In New Delhi, where walking out of the house felt like walking into an oven, officials feared that the electricity grid was being overwhelmed and that the city’s water supply might need rationing. The past 12 months have been the planet’s hottest ever recorded, and cities like Miami are experiencing extreme heat even before the arrival of summer. Scientists said this week that the average person on Earth had experienced 26 more days of abnormally high temperatures in the past year than would have been the case without human-induced climate change. Extreme heat can cause serious health issues and can be fatal. Although late-afternoon dust storms and light drizzle in New Delhi had brought hope of some reprieve on Wednesday, the weather station at Mungeshpur, northwest of the capital, reported a recording of 126 degrees around 2:30 p.m. Dr. Kuldeep Srivastava, a scientist at the regional meteorological center in Delhi, said it was the highest temperature ever recorded by the automatic weather monitoring system, which was installed in 2010. In a statement later on Wednesday evening, India’s meteorological department said the Mungeshpur station was “an outlier compared to other stations.” It said it was assessing whether that station’s recording of a higher temperature than other stations around Delhi was due to an error or a local mitigating factor. The previous record for the highest temperature, around 48 degrees Celsius — about 118.5 Fahrenheit — was repeatedly crossed in recent days. Three of New Delhi’s weather stations reported temperatures of 49.8 degree Celsius — 121.8 degrees Fahrenheit — or higher on Tuesday, setting a new record even before the 52.3 degree reading on Wednesday afternoon. For weeks now, temperatures in several states in India’s north have reached well over 110 degrees, and hospitals have been reporting an uptick in cases of heatstroke. In the Himalayan states, hundreds of forest fires have been reported. Deadly fires in crowded buildings are regular occurrences in India, with many of them caused by short circuits. The rising temperatures have increased concerns about the risks. Atul Garg, Delhi’s fire chief, said daily fire-related calls have crossed 200, the highest in the past decade. “Normally during this period in the last eight to 10 years we would receive 160 calls per day,” Mr. Garg said. “We are stretched in terms of manpower.” The heat wave has coincided with campaigning for India’s general election, with the last phase of voting set to take place on June 1. Candidates, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and opposition leaders, have continued holding large public rallies, despite the temperatures. Nitin Gadkari, a cabinet minister who is running for re-election, fainted from the heat while addressing a rally, and on Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi, the opposition leader, took a break during a speech to pour water from a bottle onto his head. “It’s quite hot, no?” he said. To help conserve water amid the extreme heat, Atishi Marlena, Delhi’s water minister, announced the deployment of 200 teams to crack down on waste and misuse. Fines will be imposed for activities such as washing cars with hoses, “overflow of water tanks” and “use of domestic water for construction or commercial” purposes, she said. Delhi’s lieutenant governor, V.K. Saxena, ordered measures to protect construction workers during the midday heat, and for water to be provided at bus stands. The state broadcaster reported that Mr. Saxena, who was appointed by Mr. Modi, had also called for construction workers to get “paid leave” between noon and 3 p.m. But it did not say how that would be implemented, particularly at a moment when the capital region’s administration is paralyzed by infighting between its lieutenant governor and the elected chief minister. Just how much the heat has affected daily life in the Indian capital was captured in the adjournment order of a consumer dispute court last week when the most intense period of the heat wave began. The presiding official, Suresh Kumar Gupta, complained that the room had no air-conditioning, and the water supply in the bathrooms was also affected. “There is too much heat in the courtroom, which led to sweating, as such it is difficult to hear arguments,” he said in the order. “In these circumstances, arguments cannot be heard, so case is adjourned.” Jitender Singh, 42, an auto rickshaw driver in the eastern part of the city, said that business was down by about a third because people were avoiding leaving their homes. He said he and his colleagues had frequently fallen sick. “But we must come on the road to support our families,” he added.",new delhi recorded highest temperature ever measured wednesday degree fahrenheit degree celsius leaving resident indian capital sweltering heat wave kept temperature several indian state well degree week new delhi walking house felt like walking oven official feared electricity grid overwhelmed city water supply might need rationing past month planet hottest ever recorded city like miami experiencing extreme heat even arrival summer scientist said week average person earth experienced day abnormally high temperature past year would case without humaninduced climate change extreme heat cause serious health issue fatal although lateafternoon dust storm light drizzle new delhi brought hope reprieve wednesday weather station mungeshpur northwest capital reported recording degree around pm dr kuldeep srivastava scientist regional meteorological center delhi said highest temperature ever recorded automatic weather monitoring system installed statement later wednesday evening india meteorological department said mungeshpur station outlier compared station said assessing whether station recording higher temperature station around delhi due error local mitigating factor previous record highest temperature around degree celsius fahrenheit repeatedly crossed recent day three new delhi weather station reported temperature degree celsius degree fahrenheit higher tuesday setting new record even degree reading wednesday afternoon week temperature several state india north reached well degree hospital reporting uptick case heatstroke himalayan state hundred forest fire reported deadly fire crowded building regular occurrence india many caused short circuit rising temperature increased concern risk atul garg delhi fire chief said daily firerelated call crossed highest past decade normally period last eight year would receive call per day mr garg said stretched term manpower heat wave coincided campaigning india general election last phase voting set take place june candidate including prime minister narendra modi opposition leader continued holding large public rally despite temperature nitin gadkari cabinet minister running reelection fainted heat addressing rally tuesday rahul gandhi opposition leader took break speech pour water bottle onto head quite hot said help conserve water amid extreme heat atishi marlena delhi water minister announced deployment team crack waste misuse fine imposed activity washing car hose overflow water tank use domestic water construction commercial purpose said delhi lieutenant governor vk saxena ordered measure protect construction worker midday heat water provided bus stand state broadcaster reported mr saxena appointed mr modi also called construction worker get paid leave noon pm say would implemented particularly moment capital region administration paralyzed infighting lieutenant governor elected chief minister much heat affected daily life indian capital captured adjournment order consumer dispute court last week intense period heat wave began presiding official suresh kumar gupta complained room airconditioning water supply bathroom also affected much heat courtroom led sweating difficult hear argument said order circumstance argument heard case adjourned jitender singh auto rickshaw driver eastern part city said business third people avoiding leaving home said colleague frequently fallen sick must come road support family added

Remal, con vientos de más de 110 kilómetros por hora, dejó un rastro de destrucción, arrancando árboles y dañando el tendido eléctrico en toda la región, según las autoridades. La tormenta mató a 13 personas en Bangladés y dañó o destruyó más de 35.000 viviendas en las zonas costeras, afectando a unos 3,5 millones de personas, según las autoridades. Más de 13 millones de personas se quedaron sin electricidad el lunes por la noche, según funcionarios del Ministerio de Energía. El país del sur de Asia tiene 170 millones de habitantes. La tormenta también causó cortes de electricidad y daños en viviendas del estado indio de Bengala Occidental. El martes, las autoridades dijeron que al menos 10 personas habían muerto, y varias más estaban desaparecidas, después de que las fuertes lluvias de los remanentes del ciclón provocaran el derrumbe de una cantera en el estado indio del sur de Mizorán, vecino de Bangladés. La tormenta llegó tras semanas de intenso calor en la región, con temperaturas que alcanzaron los 40 grados centígrados. Remal tocó tierra cerca de Mongla, el puerto del sur de Bangladés, y de las vecinas islas Sagar, de India, hacia las 9 p. m. del domingo. Alrededor de un millón de personas fueron evacuadas de los pueblos costeros de Bangladés antes de que llegara la tormenta. La mayoría de esas aldeas quedaron inundadas, dejando a millones de personas vulnerables, según las autoridades. “Mientras el ciclón Remal azota las zonas costeras de Bangladés, más de 8,4 millones de personas, entre ellas 3,2 millones de niños, corren graves riesgos en materia de salud, nutrición, saneamiento y seguridad”, declaró en un comunicado Sheldon Yett, representante de UNICEF en Bangladés. La capital de Bangladés, Daca, en el interior del país, se vio afectada por lluvias torrenciales y fuertes vientos. La tormenta interrumpió los vuelos en el aeropuerto internacional Shah Amanat, en el sureste de Bangladés, y en el aeropuerto de Calcuta, en India. El martes, la tormenta se había debilitado, pero los meteorólogos de Bangladés e India advirtieron de que las lluvias torrenciales y los fuertes vientos podrían continuar durante unos días. Bangladés ha sufrido varias tormentas violentas en los últimos años. El pasado mes de mayo, un fuerte ciclón, Mocha, azotó Bangladés y Birmania y dejó varios muertos. La tormenta causó daños generalizados en los extensos campos de refugiados rohinyás de Cox’s Bazar, destruyendo más de 3000 cabañas y centros de aprendizaje construidos con tablillas de bambú y lonas de plástico. En Filipinas también se ha producido la primera tormenta tropical de la temporada. El tifón Ewiniar azotó el país isleño en la madrugada del sábado. La Oficina de Defensa Civil informó el lunes de que la tormenta había causado siete bajas. Según la Administración de Servicios Atmosféricos, Geofísicos y Astronómicos de Filipinas, la tormenta alcanzó rachas de más de 65 kilómetros por hora.",estamos en whatsapp empieza seguirnos ahora al menos persona fallecieron millones se quedaron sin electricidad despus de que el cicln remal la primera tormenta tropical de la temporada azotara el domingo banglads la vecina india oriental remal con vientos de m de kilmetros por hora dej un rastro de destruccin arrancando rboles daando el tendido elctrico en toda la regin segn la autoridades la tormenta mat persona en banglads da destruy m de viviendas en la zona costeras afectando unos millones de persona segn la autoridades m de millones de persona se quedaron sin electricidad el lunes por la noche segn funcionarios del ministerio de energa el pa del sur de asia tiene millones de habitantes la tormenta tambin caus cortes de electricidad daos en viviendas del estado indio de bengala occidental el martes la autoridades dijeron que al menos persona haban muerto varias m estaban desaparecidas despus de que la fuertes lluvias de los remanentes del cicln provocaran el derrumbe de una cantera en el estado indio del sur de mizorn vecino de banglads la tormenta lleg tras semanas de intenso calor en la regin con temperaturas que alcanzaron los grados centgrados remal toc tierra cerca de mongla el puerto del sur de banglads de la vecinas islas sagar de india hacia la p del domingo alrededor de un milln de persona fueron evacuadas de los pueblo costeros de banglads ante de que llegara la tormenta la mayora de esas aldeas quedaron inundadas dejando millones de persona vulnerables segn la autoridades mientras el cicln remal azota la zona costeras de banglads m de millones de persona entre ellas millones de nios corren graf riesgos en materia de salud nutricin saneamiento seguridad declar en un comunicado sheldon yett representante de unicef en banglads la capital de banglads daca en el interior del pa se vio afectada por lluvias torrenciales fuertes vientos la tormenta interrumpi los vuelos en el aeropuerto internacional shah amanat en el sureste de banglads en el aeropuerto de calcuta en india el martes la tormenta se haba debilitado pero los meteorlogos de banglads e india advirtieron de que la lluvias torrenciales los fuertes vientos podran continuar durante unos da banglads ha sufrido varias tormentas violentas en los ltimos aos el pasado me de mayo un fuerte cicln mocha azot banglads birmania dej varios muertos la tormenta caus daos generalizados en los extensos campos de refugiados rohinys de cox bazar destruyendo m de cabaas centros de aprendizaje construidos con tablillas de bamb lonas de plstico en filipinas tambin se ha producido la primera tormenta tropical de la temporada el tifn ewiniar azot el pa isleo en la madrugada del sbado la oficina de defensa civil inform el lunes de que la tormenta haba causado siete bajas segn la administracin de servicios atmosfricos geofsicos astronmicos de filipinas la tormenta alcanz rachas de m de kilmetros por hora

Remal, which had measured winds of over 70 miles per hour, left a trail of destruction, uprooting trees and damaging power lines throughout the region, officials said. The storm killed 13 people in Bangladesh, and it damaged or destroyed more than 35,000 homes across the coastal areas, affecting about 3.5 million people, according to officials. More than 13 million people there lost electricity on Monday evening, according to power ministry officials. The South Asian country has a population of 170 million. The storm also caused power outages and damaged homes in the Indian state of West Bengal. On Tuesday, officials said that at least 10 people were killed, with several more missing, after heavy rains from the remnants of the cyclone caused a stone quarry to collapse in the northeastern Indian state of Mizoram, which neighbors Bangladesh. The storm hit after weeks of intense heat in the region, with temperatures reaching about 104 Fahrenheit, or 40 Celsius. Remal made landfall near Bangladesh’s southern port of Mongla and the neighboring Sagar Islands of India around 9 p.m. on Sunday. Around a million people were evacuated from Bangladesh’s coastal villages before the storm hit. Most of those villages were flooded, leaving millions of people vulnerable, officials said. “As Cyclone Remal hits the coastal areas of Bangladesh, over 8.4 million people, including 3.2 million children, are at high health, nutrition, sanitation and safety risks,” Sheldon Yett, a UNICEF representative to Bangladesh, said in a statement. Bangladesh’s inland capital, Dhaka was hit with heavy rain and strong winds. The storm disrupted flights at Shah Amanat International Airport in southeastern Bangladesh and at Kolkata Airport in India. By Tuesday, the storm had weakened, but meteorologists in Bangladesh and India warned that heavy rain and strong winds could continue for a few days. Bangladesh has been hit with several violent storms in recent years. Last May, a severe cyclone, Mocha, hit Bangladesh and Myanmar and left several people dead. The storm caused widespread damage in the sprawling Rohingya refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, destroying over 3,000 shanties and learning centers made of bamboo slats and plastic tarpaulin. The Philippines has also seen its first tropical storm of the season. Typhoon Ewiniar hit the island nation early Saturday morning. The Office of Civil Defense reported Monday that there were seven casualties from the storm. The storm had gusts of over 40 miles per hour, according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration.",least people killed million left without power cyclone remal first tropical storm season hit bangladesh neighboring eastern india sunday remal measured wind mile per hour left trail destruction uprooting tree damaging power line throughout region official said storm killed people bangladesh damaged destroyed home across coastal area affecting million people according official million people lost electricity monday evening according power ministry official south asian country population million storm also caused power outage damaged home indian state west bengal tuesday official said least people killed several missing heavy rain remnant cyclone caused stone quarry collapse northeastern indian state mizoram neighbor bangladesh storm hit week intense heat region temperature reaching fahrenheit celsius remal made landfall near bangladesh southern port mongla neighboring sagar island india around pm sunday around million people evacuated bangladesh coastal village storm hit village flooded leaving million people vulnerable official said cyclone remal hit coastal area bangladesh million people including million child high health nutrition sanitation safety risk sheldon yett unicef representative bangladesh said statement bangladesh inland capital dhaka hit heavy rain strong wind storm disrupted flight shah amanat international airport southeastern bangladesh kolkata airport india tuesday storm weakened meteorologist bangladesh india warned heavy rain strong wind could continue day bangladesh hit several violent storm recent year last may severe cyclone mocha hit bangladesh myanmar left several people dead storm caused widespread damage sprawling rohingya refugee camp cox bazar destroying shanty learning center made bamboo slat plastic tarpaulin philippine also seen first tropical storm season typhoon ewiniar hit island nation early saturday morning office civil defense reported monday seven casualty storm storm gust mile per hour according philippine atmospheric geophysical astronomical service administration
nytimes,"Leaflet by Leaflet, a Few Aging Activists Fight India’s Tide of Bigotry","May 28, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/world/asia/india-activists.html,"One recent morning, Roop Rekha Verma, an 80-year-old peace activist and former university leader, walked through a north Indian neighborhood prone to sectarian strife and parked herself near a tea shop. From her sling bag, she pulled out a bundle of pamphlets bearing messages of religious tolerance and mutual coexistence and began handing them to passers-by. “Talk to each other. Don’t let anyone divide you,” one read in Hindi. Spreading those simple words is an act of bravery in today’s India. Ms. Verma and others like her are waging a lonely battle against a tide of hatred and bigotry increasingly normalized by India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his deputies have vilified the country’s minorities in a yearslong campaign that has escalated during the current national election, the small band of aging activists has built bridges and preached harmony between religious groups. They have continued to hit the pavement even as the price for dissent and free speech has become high, trying to keep the flame alive for the nonsectarian ideal embedded in India’s constitution and in their own memories. More than three dozen human rights defenders, poets, journalists and opposition politicians face charges, including under antiterrorism laws, for criticizing Mr. Modi’s divisive policies, according to rights groups. (The government has said little about the charges, other than repeating its line that the law takes its own course.) The crackdown has had a chilling effect on many Indians. “That is where the role of these civil society activists becomes more important,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, a deputy director at Human Rights Watch. “Despite a crackdown, they are refusing to cow down, leading them to hold placards, distributing fliers, to revive a message that once was taken for granted.” The use of posters and pamphlets to raise public awareness is a time-tested practice among Indian activists. Revolutionaries fighting for independence from British colonizers employed them to drum up support and mobilize ordinary Indians. Today, village leaders use them to spread awareness about health and other government programs. Such old-school outreach may seem quixotic in the digital age. Every day, India’s social media spaces, reaching hundreds of millions of people, are inundated with anti-Muslim vitriol promoted by the B.J.P. and its associated right-wing organizations. During the national election that ends next week, Mr. Modi and his party have targeted Muslims directly, by name, with brazen attacks both online and in campaign speeches. (The B.J.P. rejects accusations that it discriminates against Muslims, noting that government welfare programs under its supervision assist all Indians equally.) Those who have worked in places torn apart by sectarian violence say polarization can be combated only by going to people on the streets and making them understand its dangers. Merely showing up can help. For Ms. Verma, the seeds of her activism were planted during her childhood, when she listened to horror stories of the sectarian violence that left hundreds of thousands dead during the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947. Later, as a university philosophy professor, she fought caste discrimination and religious divides both inside and outside the classroom. She opposed patriarchal attitudes even as slurs were thrown at her. In the early 1980s, when she noticed that the names of mothers were excluded from student admission forms, she pressed for their inclusion and won. But more than anything else, it was the campaign to build a major Hindu temple in the town of Ayodhya in her home state of Uttar Pradesh that gave Ms. Verma’s life a new meaning. In 1992, a Hindu mob demolished a centuries-old mosque there, claiming that the site had previously held a Hindu temple. Deadly riots followed. This past January, three decades later, the Ayodhya temple opened, inaugurated by Mr. Modi. It was a significant victory for a Hindu nationalist movement whose maligning and marginalizing of Muslims is exactly what Ms. Verma has devoted herself to opposing. The Hindu majority, she said, has a responsibility to protect minorities, “not become complicit in their demonization.” While the government’s incitement of religious enmity is new in India, the sectarian divisions themselves are not. One activist, Vipin Kumar Tripathi, 76, a former physics professor at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi, said he had started gathering students after classes and educating them about the dangers of “religious radicalization” in the early 1990s. Today, Mr. Tripathi travels to different parts of India with a message of peace. Recently, he stood in a corner of a busy train station in northeastern New Delhi. As office workers, students and laborers ran toward platforms, he handed information sheets and brochures to anyone who extended a hand. His materials addressed some of the most provocative issues in India: the troubles in Kashmir, where the Modi government has rescinded the majority-Muslim region’s semi-autonomy; the politics over the Ayodhya temple; and ordinary citizens’ rights to question their government. “To respect God and to pretend to do that for votes are two different things,” read one of his handouts. At the station, Anirudh Saxena, a tall man in his early 30s with a pencil mustache, stopped and looked Mr. Tripathi straight in the eyes. “Sir, why are you doing this every week?” Mr. Saxena asked. “Read this,” Mr. Tripathi told Mr. Saxena, handing him a small 10-page booklet. “This explains why we should read books and understand history instead of reading WhatsApp garbage and extracting pleasure out of someone’s pain.” Mr. Saxena smiled, nodded his head and put the booklet in his handbag before disappearing into the crowd. If just 10 out of a thousand people read his materials, Mr. Tripathi said, his job is done. “When truth becomes the casualty, you can only fight it on the streets,” he said. Shabnam Hashmi, 66, another activist based in New Delhi, said she had helped distribute about four million pamphlets in the state of Gujarat after sectarian riots there in 2002. More than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, died in the communal violence, which happened under the watch of Mr. Modi, who was the state’s top leader at the time. During that period, she and her colleagues were harassed by right-wing activists, who threw stones at her and filed police complaints. In 2016, months after Mr. Modi became prime minister, the government prohibited foreign funding for her organization. She has continued her street activism nonetheless. “It is the most effective way of reaching the people directly,” she said. “What it does is, it somehow gives people courage to fight fear and keep resisting.” “We might not be able to stop this craziness,” she added, “but that doesn’t mean we should stop fighting.” Even before Mr. Modi’s rise, said Ms. Verma, the activist in Uttar Pradesh, governments never “showered roses” on her when she was doing things like leading marches and bringing together warring factions after flare-ups of religious violence. Over the decades, she has been threatened with prison and bundled into police vehicles. “But it was never so bad,” she said, as it has now become under Mr. Modi. The space for activism may completely vanish, Ms. Verma said, as his party becomes increasingly intolerant of any scrutiny. For now, she said, activists “are, sadly, just giving proof of our existence: that we may be demoralized, but we are still alive. Otherwise, hatred has seeped so deep it will take decades to rebuild trust.”",one recent morning roop rekha verma yearold peace activist former university leader walked north indian neighborhood prone

nytimes,Two Deadly Fires in Rapid Succession Expose India’s Gaps in Safety,"May 26, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/world/asia/india-fire-death-infants-safety.html,"Seven newborn babies lost their lives after their New Delhi neonatal clinic was engulfed in flames. What remained of the two-story building on Sunday morning was its burned facade, a charred spiral staircase and oxygen cylinders covered in soot. Hours earlier, in the western Indian city of Rajkot, an amusement park of trampolines and bowling lanes had turned to an inferno. The families of people who had come to enjoy a discounted offer of all-you-can-play to celebrate the start of summer vacation were left trying to identify bodies among the at least 27 dead, many of them children too charred to be recognizable. As after every such deadly episode, political leaders were quick with messages of condolence, announcements of arrests, creations of inquiries — and finger-pointing. But to analysts and experts who had warned for years about India’s abysmal fire preparedness, the back-to-back disasters on Saturday were the latest reminder that systemic change to make the country safer was still missing. Building safety compliance remains abysmal across India, the world’s most populous nation. The fire services have long faced huge gaps in the numbers of stations, personnel and equipment. Government audits after mass-casualty disasters unearth glaring shortcomings, with little follow-up. Though the number has gone down over the past decade, more than 20 fire-related deaths occur every day in India, according to government statistics. Many of the fires — particularly in crowded urban centers — are caused by short circuits, an alarming prospect as India faces an intense period of heat waves that strains electrical wires. R.C. Sharma, a former fire service chief in Delhi, said that one major problem is that fire regulations go unenforced. Another is that fire-response resources have failed to keep up with urbanization that is happening rapidly and often without regard to safety. “We are not in a good condition,” Mr. Sharma said. “In other countries, you have fire hydrants and everything at all the places. But in India, we don’t even have drinking water around the clock, so we do not think of having firefighting water around the clock.” Data provided to the Indian Parliament in 2019 by the country’s Home Ministry painted a dire state of preparedness, with major deficiencies. India had only 3,377 fire stations when regulations called for 8,559. The shortfall in personnel and equipment was even worse. The fire service had about 55,000 people, when a half-million were called for, and 7,300 vehicles, when it should have had 33,000. It is unclear how much of those gaps have been filled in the five years since. A new $600 million program for expansion and modernization of the fire service announced by India’s central government last year, with additional resources to be pooled from the states, suggests a lot of it remains undone. Government audits have repeatedly flagged the vulnerability of public buildings, particularly hospitals. A study last year of hospitals across India where there had been a fire in the past decade showed that half were not legally compliant on safety measures. Private and public hospitals were about equally bad. Short circuits were the cause of the fires in nearly 90 percent of the episodes. In one state, after a fire killed 10 babies in a neonatal care unit, assessments found that more than 80 percent of the state’s hospitals had never carried out fire safety audits; half had never conducted fire drills; and only a few had fire safety certificates. “The tendency is to comply in letter, not spirit,” said S.A. Abbasi, an emeritus professor at Pondicherry University, who was the lead author of the report. “Lapses and laxity continue to be the norms rather than exceptions.” What caused the fire at the amusement park in Rajkot, in the state of Gujarat, was not known. But the initial police complaint, a copy of which was seen by The New York Times, made clear that the facility lacked both a clearance certificate from the fire department and effective equipment and protocols in case of fire. Ilesh Kher, Rajkot’s chief fire officer, said the fire at the facility had started just before 6 p.m., and the flames were contained in a little over an hour. He did not know how many people were present when the blaze broke out, but witness accounts in local news suggested over 100. The building appeared to be a temporary structure made of iron poles and metal sheets. Daksh Kujadia, a teenager who had gone bowling with a cousin, said the fire had started under an emergency exit. About 30 people became trapped in the bowling lanes. “We didn’t have an option but to tear the metal sheet in a corner,” he told local news media. “Fifteen of us got out by jumping from there.” The two-story Delhi neonatal hospital that caught fire just before midnight was operating out of a residential building. Neighbors described frequent disputes, as trucks often blocked the road outside the hospital to unload large cylinders of oxygen. “A few of us climbed on top of each other and climbed into the building from the back side,” said Ravi Gupta, who lives in the area and helped evacuate a dozen babies from the back of the building as the front caught fire and multiple explosions were heard as oxygen cylinders burst. “We brought ladders and bedsheets from our houses. I carried infants in my hands from the fire and brought them down.” Health care in Delhi, India’s capital, has in recent years has been caught in a messy political fight between the central government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Delhi’s elected local government, run by a smaller opposition party, the Aam Aadmi Party, or A.A.P. The local administration has accused Mr. Modi of using his control over government officials to handicap its efforts. Accusations continued to fly after Saturday’s deadly hospital fire. Pankaj Luthra, a local official affiliated with Modi’s party in the neighborhood where the hospital is, blamed the A.A.P. for giving the hospital its license. There had been, he said, complaints of illegal oxygen cylinder refilling at the hospital. Saurabh Bhardwaj, A.A.P.’s health minister for Delhi, released a statement complaining that the most senior official in Delhi’s health department — a civil servant technically supervised by Mr. Bhardwaj, but in fact answering to the central government — was ignoring his calls and messages. “I got to know about this incident through a media flash,” Mr. Bhardwaj said.",seven newborn baby lost life new delhi neonatal clinic engulfed flame remained twostory building sunday morning burned facade charred spiral staircase oxygen cylinder covered soot hour earlier western indian city rajkot amusement park trampoline bowling lane turned inferno family people come enjoy discounted offer allyoucanplay celebrate start summer vacation left trying identify body among least dead many child charred recognizable every deadly episode political leader quick message condolence announcement arrest creation inquiry fingerpointing analyst expert warned year india abysmal fire preparedness backtoback disaster saturday latest reminder systemic change make country safer still missing building safety compliance remains abysmal across india world populous nation fire service long faced huge gap number station personnel equipment government audit masscasualty disaster unearth glaring shortcoming little followup though number gone past decade firerelated death occur every day india according government statistic many fire particularly crowded urban center caused short circuit alarming prospect india face intense period heat wave strain electrical wire rc sharma former fire service chief delhi said one major problem fire regulation go unenforced another fireresponse resource failed keep urbanization happening rapidly often without regard safety good condition mr sharma said country fire hydrant everything place india dont even drinking water around clock think firefighting water around clock data provided indian parliament country home ministry painted dire state preparedness major deficiency india fire station regulation called shortfall personnel equipment even worse fire service people halfmillion called vehicle unclear much gap filled five year since new million program expansion modernization fire service announced india central government last year additional resource pooled state suggests lot remains undone government audit repeatedly flagged vulnerability public building particularly hospital study last year hospital across india fire past decade showed half legally compliant safety measure private public hospital equally bad short circuit cause fire nearly percent episode one state fire killed baby neonatal care unit assessment found percent state hospital never carried fire safety audit half never conducted fire drill fire safety certificate tendency comply letter spirit said sa abbasi emeritus professor pondicherry university lead author report lapse laxity continue norm rather exception caused fire amusement park rajkot state gujarat known initial police complaint copy seen new york time made clear facility lacked clearance certificate fire department effective equipment protocol case fire ilesh kher rajkots chief fire officer said fire facility started pm flame contained little hour know many people present blaze broke witness account local news suggested building appeared temporary structure made iron pole metal sheet daksh kujadia teenager gone bowling cousin said fire started emergency exit people became trapped bowling lane didnt option tear metal sheet corner told local news medium fifteen u got jumping twostory delhi neonatal hospital caught fire midnight operating residential building neighbor described frequent dispute truck often blocked road outside hospital unload large cylinder oxygen u climbed top climbed building back side said ravi gupta life area helped evacuate dozen baby back building front caught fire multiple explosion heard oxygen cylinder burst brought ladder bedsheets house carried infant hand fire brought health care delhi india capital recent year caught messy political fight central government prime minister narendra modi delhi elected local government run smaller opposition party aam aadmi party aap local administration accused mr modi using control government official handicap effort accusation continued fly saturday deadly hospital fire pankaj luthra local official affiliated modis party neighborhood hospital blamed aap giving hospital license said complaint illegal oxygen cylinder refilling hospital saurabh bhardwaj aaps health minister delhi released statement complaining senior official delhi health department civil servant technically supervised mr bhardwaj fact answering central government ignoring call message got know incident medium flash mr bhardwaj said
nytimes,"I’m an Indian Muslim, and I’m Scared to Say So","May 26, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/opinion/india-muslim-modi-election.html,"I used to answer the phone with “Salam.” Not anymore. I don’t want people to know I’m a Muslim. There is little that would identify me as Muslim to begin with, aside from my name. I don’t wear a skullcap, and in public I avoid wearing the loosefitting Pathani kurta and peppering my speech with Urdu words, all of which are identity markers for Indian Muslims. But in the India of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you can’t take any chances. For 10 years, Mr. Modi’s Hindu-chauvinist government has vilified the nation’s 200 million Muslims as dangerous undesirables. Recently, he took that rhetoric to a new low during the six weeks of voting in India’s national elections — which are widely expected to win him a third consecutive five-year term — directly referring to Muslims as “infiltrators” in a country that he and his followers seek to turn into a pure Hindu state. As offensive as that was, it is sadly familiar to Indian Muslims like me who — after a decade of denigration, violence and murder — live in daily fear of being identified and attacked, forcing us into self-denial to protect ourselves. India is home to one of the world’s largest Muslim populations. Islam came here around 1,300 years ago, and Indian Muslims descend from natives of this land who converted to Islam centuries ago. Many Indian Muslims fought against British colonization, and millions rejected the 1947 partition of the country into a predominantly Hindu India and a mostly Muslim Pakistan. India is our home, and people like me are proud patriots. But Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalism has made us the targets in what might be the largest radicalization of people on the planet. Its seeds were planted with the founding in 1925 of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing Hindu organization that sought the establishment of a fully Hindu state in India and was inspired by the European fascism of that era. When Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party — a political offshoot of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh — won elections in 2014 and he became prime minister, he and his followers saw it as the civilizational moment that Hindus had been waiting for. Mr. Modi was the god-king who would free Hindu civilization from centuries of domination, first by a series of Muslim rulers culminating with the Mughal empire that ruled India for around three centuries and then by the British colonizers who followed. Islamophobia isn’t new to India, and Muslims also faced prejudice and recurring violence during the generations in which the liberal upper-caste Hindu elite dominated the nation’s secular democratic politics. But under Mr. Modi’s right-wing leadership, hatred of Muslims has effectively become state policy. India is now a country where police have been accused of standing by as Hindus attack Muslims, where the killers of religious minorities go unpunished and where Hindu extremists openly call for the genocide of Muslims. Protest, and you run the risk of having a Hindu mob unleashed on you. That’s what happened after Mr. Modi’s government in 2019 pushed through a citizenship law that discriminates against Muslims and his party promised to expel “infiltrators” from the country. When Indian Muslims protested, one of Mr. Modi’s supporters responded with a provocative speech that is blamed for sparking deadly clashes between Hindus and Muslims in Delhi in February 2020. Police were accused of looking the other way as Muslims had their shops destroyed, were assaulted and were even killed. Bulldozers have become a symbol of this state terrorism — rolled out at right-wing rallies, tattooed on the arms of Modi supporters and featured in Hindu nationalist songs — because of their use in areas governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party to illegally knock down the homes and businesses of Muslims who dare to speak up. Some states have essentially made Muslim-Hindu relationships illegal, based on an absurd Hindu conspiracy theory that Muslim men are seducing Hindu women as part of a long-term plan to turn India into a Muslim nation. The liberal Hindu elite, instead of acknowledging its role in enabling the sentiments on which Mr. Modi has capitalized, has done little to help, other than to ineffectually express nostalgia for a lost Hindu tolerance. And there is little that Indian Muslims can do within the political system: Although the Muslim share of India’s population has slowly grown to 14 percent, the percentage of Parliament members who are Muslim has declined to less than 5 percent today, compared with 9 percent in the early 1980s. The Indian Muslim response to our subjugation has largely been a deafening silence. Many of us are simply unwilling to speak out against the Modi government’s bitter bargain: that for us to exist as Indian citizens, we must meekly accept historical revisionism, dehumanization and demonization. This debasement, and the knowledge that you are essentially outside the protection of the law, kills something inside you. You take precautions to protect yourself. My mother no longer packs mutton for me to take back to Delhi after I visit her, as she used to. She’s afraid it will be mistaken for beef: Dozens of Muslims have reportedly been killed or assaulted by Hindu mobs on suspicion of killing cows — which are sacred to Hindus — or for eating or possessing beef. Muslim parents now routinely repeat a litany of don’ts to their children: Don’t appear Muslim in public, don’t reveal your name, don’t enter Hindu areas or travel alone and don’t get pulled into any potential confrontation. While we caution one another to blend in, it’s difficult to reconcile with the whole thing. Each of us has something embedded in our sense of self and expression that is particularly painful to erase. And the sort of physical markers we are trying to hide are not even wholly specific to Muslims in India. My cousin likes to wear his Pathani kurta, but so do many Hindus. My youngest sister prefers to keep her head covered, but so do many Hindu women, although not with a hijab. I’m attached to using certain Urdu words that have long been a feature of India’s syncretic culture and have been used widely by Hindus, too. Self-denial leads to deep frustration. Now during gatherings with friends and family, we avoid politics; discussing the elephant in the room only reminds us of our helplessness. The cumulative weight of all this has created a mental health crisis of fear and depression among Muslims. Yet because of a desperate shortage of mental health professionals in India and a limited understanding of our new reality by many non-Muslim therapists, many Muslims are left to cope on their own. I was hesitant to write this essay. I am not supposed to protest, to speak up. When I sometimes do, posting online about it, the typical response is, “Go to Pakistan.” But why would I leave? I am an Indian. I was born here, as were my ancestors who opposed the religious basis of the partition with Pakistan and believed in the Indian ideals of secular democracy. But many Muslims have fled over the years, emigrating to Australia, Canada, Britain, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia or elsewhere because of the worsening political climate. Many who can’t afford to emigrate are moving out of the predominantly Hindu or mixed neighborhoods where they lived for decades, to poorer Muslim areas for safety. Two of my Muslim friends and I used to own apartments in a suburban area near New Delhi where many upper-caste Hindus lived. But in 2020, after the discriminatory citizenship law was passed, a Hindu mob charged through the neighborhood baying for Muslim blood. My two friends soon moved out. I kept my apartment, but in the elevator one evening in 2022, I overheard two men discussing how many katua (a derogatory term for Muslims that refers to circumcision) lived in the area. I moved out the next day. Sadly, Hindu friends and colleagues of mine also have become colder and more distant and are dropping out of contact. On June 1, India’s voting period comes to a close. It looms as a day of dread for Muslims like me. According to most projections, it will be another victory for Mr. Modi — and further validation of mob rule and the debasement of 200 million Muslims by a hubristic Hindu majority.",used answer phone

nytimes,Free Food? Modi Makes Sure Every Indian Knows Whom to Thank for It.,"May 26, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/world/asia/india-welfare-modi.html,"Durga Prasad, an 80-year-old farmer, was resting under the shade of a tree in front of his home when the party workers came. An app on their smartphones could tell them in an instant who Mr. Prasad was, whom he might vote for — and why he should be grateful to India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. “You get installments of 2,000 rupees, right?” asked a local official from Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. Mr. Prasad concurred. He receives $72 a year through a farmers’ welfare program started and branded by Mr. Modi. “Do you get rations?” the official then asked, though he already knew the answer. He had made his point. Such handouts are among the most distinctive parts of Mr. Modi’s mass appeal. The country’s new airports, diplomatic prestige and booming stock markets may look like Mr. Modi’s calling card, but for the 95 percent of Indians who earn too little to file income taxes, small infusions of cash and household goods matter more. And Mr. Modi’s party is organized to make the most of them in the national election that ends early next month. India’s welfare programs are vast in reach and scope. Under the biggest, 821 million Indians are entitled to five-kilogram (11-pound) sacks of free rice or wheat every month. The government started doling out grain to prevent hunger early in the pandemic and has since committed $142 billion to the program. Mr. Modi’s face began appearing on the sacks in January. Another prime minister-branded program has helped people build 15 million homes since 2015, at a price tag of $3 billion a year; home improvements and additions are covered, too. The government has also footed the cost of millions of toilets, and it is working to provide piped drinking water to every home. The foundation of this expanded welfare system was laid soon after Mr. Modi became prime minister in 2014. Bank accounts, also “P.M.” branded, became available to all Indians who lacked them, meshed with a universal-ID program started by the previous government. The accounts gave the state valuable information about the financial lives of even its poorest citizens. And they opened the way for “direct benefit transfers,” money that bypasses the sometimes corrupt local officials who once distributed welfare — appearing to come instead from Mr. Modi himself. These transfers grew to $76 billion in the last fiscal year. But Mr. Modi’s budgets have not become profligate. That is in part because government spending on education and health care — long-term investments — has shrunk as a share of the economy as branded welfare programs have proliferated. Spending on a guaranteed-employment program associated with Mr. Modi’s opponents has also fallen. Whatever the motivation behind them, the tangible food and household benefits prioritized by Mr. Modi have relieved Indians’ pain as the economy slowed before the pandemic, collapsed during its first year and then recovered unevenly. The Hindu-nationalist government distributes the assistance equally among all religious groups, even if it does not receive many votes from some of them. The handouts are perhaps the most powerful thing Mr. Modi can point to when claiming credit for improving the lives of his fellow Indians, hundreds of millions of whom remain desperate for reliable jobs with decent pay. Vinod Misra, the local B.J.P. official who recently visited Mr. Prasad in Amethi, a district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, explained that in poorer places where people once died of hunger, “our party is working especially for programs that touch everyone.” “All we have to do is go and tell the family, ‘Brother, this roof you got, who made it happen?’” Mr. Misra said. In a country where 80 percent of the population is either rural or poor, people are dead serious about getting something in exchange for their votes, said Pradeep Gupta, the director of Axis My India, a polling outfit. If a politician delivers on promises, “the people elect you again and again and again,” Mr. Gupta said. Everything else is “marketing.” The B.J.P.’s follow-up with voters is the end result of a gargantuan effort that leverages its ideologically committed core membership, its funding, its nationwide organization and, increasingly, its sophisticated management of data. In the temple town of Pushkar, west of Amethi within the Hindi-speaking “cow belt” that is a stronghold of the B.J.P., another local party worker explained the virtue of an app called Saral. With a few swipes and taps, the worker, Shakti Singh Rathore, shared a bird’s-eye view of his neighbors, whom he intended to marshal for Mr. Modi. There are 241 “booths,” or polling stations, in Pushkar’s constituency, each with its own mapped boundaries. Mr. Rathore flicked open the information for one of the booths he was supervising. His targets were not just voters, but beneficiaries, or “labharthis” — an important new term of art in the ground campaign. “The labharthis’ names are all listed here,” Mr. Rathore said. One man he named had received a cooking gas cylinder — “here is his address and postal code and phone number.” Another had gotten cash from the farmers’ welfare program. “All the data is here,” Mr. Rathore said. Anyone can download Saral through the Apple or Google Play stores for campaign updates, though only enlisted B.J.P. workers get to explore its databases. The party’s national leadership has said it uses Saral to connect more than six million of its workers. They can both retrieve and upload data about voters and beneficiaries. Voters do not seem bothered, or are at least not surprised, that so much information about their relationships with the national government is carried door to door by political workers. Mr. Misra said he did not know exactly how all the personal information made its way into the app. Other local-level workers said they assumed that the data had been provided by the government itself, given its accuracy. Amit Malviya, the B.J.P.’s head of information and technology, said at a start-up conference in December that the 30 terabytes of data had been collected manually by the party over the past 10 elections. Saral does many other things that are useful for the party’s ground game. It tracks workers’ outreach and measures them against one another by their performance, in effect “gamifying” the hard slog of canvassing. It also gives the workers the chance to help smooth out voters’ receipt of their benefits, erasing the distinction between partisan politics and government work. Mr. Modi himself said to a TV crew this month that he had told party workers to gather information about voters who had not received their benefits and to “assure them that it’s the Modi guarantee — they will get it in my third term.” Ajay Singh Gaur, a B.J.P. worker who accompanied Mr. Misra for the doorstepping around Amethi, found himself drawn into a long exchange with Dinesh Maurya, a farmer who complained that a faulty electrical wire had fallen onto his wheat field. “My whole crop was burned down, and I haven’t got a single coin’s worth of compensation,” Mr. Maurya said. Mr. Gaur assured Mr. Maurya that he would get him the money the state owed him. “I have spoken to the officer in charge” at the generating station, he said. “I will get it done.”",durga prasad yearold

nytimes,Is Modi Worried? India’s Long-Deflated Opposition Finds Some Momentum.,"May 23, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/world/asia/india-election-modi-opposition.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi entered India’s general election projecting supreme confidence. “Ab ki baar, 400 paar” went his party’s slogan, meaning this time his side was gunning to surpass 400 seats in the lower house of Parliament, a staggering majority. But as the seven-week voting period enters its final stretch, with results expected on June 4, India is witnessing something unusual from its powerful leader. It is seeing him sweat. As Mr. Modi crisscrosses the country for rallies in 100-degree heat, he has often appeared on the defensive, and sometimes rattled. He has frequently set aside his party’s main campaign message — that India is rising under his leadership — to counter his opponents’ portrayal of him as favoring business and caste elites. He has resorted to stoking anti-Muslim sentiments to fend off attempts to split his Hindu support base, only to deny his own words later. Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., is still a heavy favorite. But it is finding that the political opposition, counted out after big losses to Mr. Modi in the previous two national elections, has some fight left in it. The opposition has found traction in challenging Mr. Modi’s control over the national narrative. With the broadcast media cowed by him, opposition leaders have turned to online platforms to find an audience for a pitch focused on economic and social justice, painting the prime minister as a primary culprit in India’s growing inequality. Before the election, often-bickering opposition parties united in a grand alliance to confront a shared threat: what they call Mr. Modi’s mission to cripple them and remake the country into one-party rule. The alliance lost precious time in the months before the vote, bogged down by internal differences. But it has largely held together despite Mr. Modi’s efforts to lure away some of its members and sideline others with legal actions. The alliance hopes that this translates into an improved electoral showing, after scattered votes for opposition parties in the 2019 election worked to Mr. Modi’s advantage. To have any hope of cutting significantly into the governing party’s existing strong majority in Parliament, the opposition will have to flip a large number of seats in the more populous north, where the B.J.P. is well entrenched, and hold its ground in the more prosperous south. “The opposition realized it was now or never,” said Arati Jerath, a political analyst in New Delhi. “It had to fight Modi with all the weapons it could muster or face certain death.” Analysts say elections that focus on local issues favor the opposition. This spring, Mr. Modi has again made a parliamentary election, contested across more than 540 seats, into a presidential-style national referendum on his own huge popularity and his achievements. But it has become clear that, a decade into his rule, his ability to steer elections away from local concerns — and cover for his party’s parochial struggles and infighting — is waning. The opposition has tried to take advantage with an energized ground game. In the lead-up to the vote, Mr. Modi intensified a political crackdown. Chief ministers of two opposition-controlled states were thrown in jail, and the bank accounts of the Indian National Congress, the main opposition party, were essentially frozen. “But people started campaigning door to door, village to village, state to state. So that has become really a groundwork for the opposition,” Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the Congress party, said in an interview. “Now they are frustrated,” he added, referring to the B.J.P. The Congress party is trying to pull itself out of an immense hole. The rise of caste-based regional parties marginalized the once-dominant Congress in India’s electorally crucial north, and Mr. Modi’s ascendence set it back further. Mr. Modi, who had spent a lifetime working his way up from a humble background, easily cast the face of the Congress, Rahul Gandhi, as a detached, lightweight beneficiary of dynastic politics. Just how far the Congress is trying to distance itself from that impression is evident in its election manifesto — both in form and substance. The party’s 2019 manifesto had a fresh-faced Mr. Gandhi front and center, with a message of jobs and economic development. In the 2024 document, he wears a graying beard, a nod to the time he spent connecting with rural India during two cross-country journeys since 2022, one of them covering 2,000 miles by foot. If that was not enough, next to him is the 81-year-old Mr. Kharge, elected in 2022 as the Congress president. His half a century in politics, and his background as a Dalit at the bottom of India’s rigid caste hierarchy, helps offset Mr. Modi’s personal story. The Congress’s campaign promises — from cash transfers to poor women to a “guarantee of first jobs” for young people through one-year paid apprenticeships — shows that it has learned from its successes in India’s southern states, said Sugata Srinivasaraju, the author of a book on Mr. Gandhi’s struggles in leading his party. “This is good,” Mr. Srinivasaraju said. “But the Congress does not have any emotional or cultural argument to counter” the B.J.P., with its Hindu-nationalist ideology. The closest the Congress has come is its effort to fuse two issues: longstanding caste inequality and rising unemployment. India’s Constitution sets aside about half of government jobs and seats in higher education for the middle and lower ranks in the caste system. With the economy struggling to create enough private-sector jobs, these government positions are seen as crucial for any hope of economic mobility. The Congress’s call for a census of Indians by caste — there has been no official national data on the size of each caste for decades — appears to be striking a chord. The party says such an exercise would ensure that marginalized Indians get their rightful share of slots. That push is also furthering two charges aimed at Mr. Modi: that he has overseen an economy that benefits only billionaires, and that his party has an upper-caste bias. While it is true that the B.J.P. was once an upper-caste, urban party, Mr. Modi has broadened its base by bringing in lower castes. But his response to the charge suggests he is nervous that the label may stick. “He’s for the rich,” Mr. Kharge said at a large rally in Mumbai. “He has done nothing for the poor.” Behind Mr. Kharge were the leaders of several parties in the alliance, each of whom would draw on a grievance to depict Mr. Modi as dangerous for India. One of them, Arvind Kejriwal, made a particularly personal case that Mr. Modi is trying to turn the country into something like Russia under President Vladimir V. Putin — “one nation, one leader.” “I am coming straight from jail,” Mr. Kejriwal began his speech. His Aam Aadmi Party holds power in the Delhi region and in the northern state of Punjab. Its expansion is a threat to Mr. Modi, whose government arrested Mr. Kejriwal over corruption allegations just before the election, creating the absurd reality in which India’s capital was being run from a jail cell. Mr. Kejriwal managed to get a three-week bail during the campaigning. As he jumps from rally to rally across the country, his connection with crowds makes clear why Mr. Modi would have liked to keep him behind bars. In Mumbai, he painted India under Mr. Modi as a dystopia where anyone who gets in the prime minister’s way will be locked up. Mr. Kejriwal said he had been kept under the surveillance of multiple cameras in jail — “watching what time I wake up, what time I go to the bathroom, how long I sit on the toilet.” Then he made his final appeal. This election, he said, is a vote for either keeping him in jail or restoring his freedom. He will be watching the results on June 4 from his cell. “You can write me letters,” he said. “Cell No. 25, Jail No. 2, Tihar Jail.”",prime minister narendra modi entered india general election

nytimes,Strangers in Their Own Land: Being Muslim in Modi’s India,"May 18, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/18/world/asia/muslims-india.html,"It is a lonely feeling to know that your country’s leaders do not want you. To be vilified because you are a Muslim in what is now a largely Hindu-first India. It colors everything. Friends, dear for decades, change. Neighbors hold back from neighborly gestures — no longer joining in celebrations, or knocking to inquire in moments of pain. “It is a lifeless life,” said Ziya Us Salam, a writer who lives on the outskirts of Delhi with his wife, Uzma Ausaf, and their four daughters. When he was a film critic for one of India’s main newspapers, Mr. Salam, 53, filled his time with cinema, art, music. Workdays ended with riding on the back of an older friend’s motorcycle to a favorite food stall for long chats. His wife, a fellow journalist, wrote about life, food and fashion. Now, Mr. Salam’s routine is reduced to office and home, his thoughts occupied by heavier concerns. The constant ethnic profiling because he is “visibly Muslim” — by the bank teller, by the parking lot attendant, by fellow passengers on the train — is wearying, he said. Family conversations are darker, with both parents focused on raising their daughters in a country that increasingly questions or even tries to erase the markers of Muslims’ identity — how they dress, what they eat, even their Indianness altogether. One of the daughters, an impressive student-athlete, struggled so much that she needed counseling and missed months of school. The family often debates whether to stay in their mixed Hindu-Muslim neighborhood in Noida, just outside Delhi. Mariam, their oldest daughter, who is a graduate student, leans toward compromise, anything to make life bearable. She wants to move. Anywhere but a Muslim area might be difficult. Real estate agents often ask outright if families are Muslim; landlords are reluctant to rent to them. “I have started taking it in stride,” Mariam said. “I refuse to,” Mr. Salam shot back. He is old enough to remember when coexistence was largely the norm in an enormously diverse India, and he does not want to add to the country’s increasing segregation. But he is also pragmatic. He wishes Mariam would move abroad, at least while the country is like this. Mr. Salam clings to the hope that India is in a passing phase. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, is playing a long game. His rise to national power in 2014, on a promise of rapid development, swept a decades-old Hindu nationalist movement from the margins of Indian politics firmly to the center. He has since chipped away at the secular framework and robust democracy that had long held India together despite its sometimes explosive religious and caste divisions. Right-wing organizations began using the enormous power around Mr. Modi as a shield to try to reshape Indian society. Their members provoked sectarian clashes as the government looked away, with officials showing up later to raze Muslim homes and round up Muslim men. Emboldened vigilante groups lynched Muslims they accused of smuggling beef (cows are sacred to many Hindus). Top leaders in Mr. Modi’s party openly celebrated Hindus who committed crimes against Muslims. On large sections of broadcast media, but particularly on social media, bigotry coursed unchecked. WhatsApp groups spread conspiracy theories about Muslim men luring Hindu women for religious conversion, or even about Muslims spitting in restaurant food. While Mr. Modi and his party officials reject claims of discrimination by pointing to welfare programs that cover Indians equally, Mr. Modi himself is now repeating anti-Muslim tropes in the election that ends early next month. He has targeted India’s 200 million Muslims more directly than ever, calling them “infiltrators” and insinuating that they have too many children. This creeping Islamophobia is now the dominant theme of Mr. Salam’s writings. Cinema and music, life’s pleasures, feel smaller now. In one book, he chronicled the lynchings of Muslim men. In a recent follow-up, he described how India’s Muslims feel “orphaned” in their homeland. “If I don’t pick up issues of import, and limit my energies to cinema and literature, then I won’t be able to look at myself in the mirror,” he said. “What would I tell my kids tomorrow — when my grandchildren ask me what were you doing when there was an existential crisis?” As a child, Mr. Salam lived on a mixed street of Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims in Delhi. When the afternoon sun would grow hot, the children would move their games under the trees in the yard of a Hindu temple. The priest would come with water for all. “I was like any other kid for him,” Mr. Salam recalled. Those memories are one reason Mr. Salam maintains a stubborn optimism that India can restore its secular fabric. Another is that Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalism, while sweeping large parts of the country, has been resisted by several states in the country’s more prosperous south. Family conversations among Muslims there are very different: about college degrees, job promotions, life plans — the usual aspirations. In the state of Tamil Nadu, often-bickering political parties are united in protecting secularism and in focusing on economic well-being. Its chief minister, M.K. Stalin, is a declared atheist. Jan Mohammed, who lives with his family of five in Chennai, the state capital, said neighbors joined in each other’s religious celebrations. In rural areas, there is a tradition: When one community finishes building a place of worship, villagers of other faiths arrive with gifts of fruits, vegetables and flowers and stay for a meal. “More than accommodation, there is understanding,” Mr. Mohammed said. His family is full of overachievers — the norm in their educated state. Mr. Mohammed, with a master’s degree, is in the construction business. His wife, Rukhsana, who has an economics degree, started an online clothing business after the children grew up. One daughter, Maimoona Bushra, has two master’s degrees and now teaches at a local college as she prepares for her wedding. The youngest, Hafsa Lubna, has a master’s in commerce and within two years went from an intern at a local company to a manager of 20. Two of the daughters had planned to continue on to Ph.D’s. The only worry was that potential grooms would be intimidated. “The proposals go down,” Ms. Rukhsana joked. A thousand miles north, in Delhi, Mr. Salam’s family lives in what feels like another country. A place where prejudice has become so routine that even a friendship of 26 years can be sundered as a result. Mr. Salam had nicknamed a former editor “human mountain” for his large stature. When they rode on the editor’s motorcycle after work in the Delhi winter, he shielded Mr. Salam from the wind. They were together often; when his friend got his driver’s license, Mr. Salam was there with him. “I would go to my prayer every day, and he would go to the temple every day,” Mr. Salam said. “And I used to respect him for that.” A few years ago, things began to change. The WhatsApp messages came first. The editor started forwarding to Mr. Salam some staples of anti-Muslim misinformation: for example, that Muslims will rule India in 20 years because their women give birth every year and their men are allowed four wives. “Initially, I said, ‘Why do you want to get into all this?’ I thought he was just an old man who was getting all these and forwarding,” Mr. Salam said. “I give him the benefit of doubt.” The breaking point came two years ago, when Yogi Adityanath, a Modi protégé, was re-elected as the leader of Uttar Pradesh, the populous state adjoining Delhi where the Salam family lives. Mr. Adityanath, more overtly belligerent than Mr. Modi toward Muslims, governs in the saffron robe of a Hindu monk, frequently greeting large crowds of Hindu pilgrims with flowers, while cracking down on public displays of Muslim faith. On the day of the vote counting, the friend kept calling Mr. Salam, rejoicing at Mr. Adityanath’s lead. Just days earlier, the friend had been complaining about rising unemployment and his son’s struggle to find a job during Mr. Adityanath’s first term. “I said, ‘You have been so happy since morning, what do you gain?’” he recalled asking the friend. “Yogi ended namaz,” the friend responded, referring to Muslim prayer on Fridays that often spills into the streets. “That was the day I said goodbye,” Mr. Salam said, “and he hasn’t come back into my life after that.”",lonely feeling know country leader want vilified muslim largely hindufirst india color everything friend dear decade

nytimes,La diplomacia de Musk: cautivar a la derecha mundial para beneficiarse,"May 16, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/05/16/espanol/elon-musk-lideres-mundiales-tesla-beneficios.html,"Unos minutos después de que se hizo evidente que Javier Milei había sido elegido presidente del segundo país más grande de América del Sur, en noviembre, Elon Musk publicó en la red social X (antes conocida como Twitter): “La prosperidad está por venir en Argentina”. Desde entonces, Musk ha seguido usando X, la red social de la que es dueño, para alentar a Milei. El multimillonario ha compartido videos en los que el presidente argentino ataca la “justicia social” con sus 182 millones de seguidores. Musk ha ayudado a convertir al belicoso libertario en uno de los nuevos rostros de la derecha moderna. Pero fuera de línea, ha aprovechado esta relación para ejercer presión y obtener beneficios para sus otras empresas, la fabricante de automóviles eléctricos Tesla y la constructora de cohetes espaciales SpaceX. “Me llamó Elon Musk”, afirmó Milei en una entrevista por televisión unas semanas después de asumir el cargo. “Está sumamente interesado en el litio”. Musk ha declarado que el litio —el elemento blanco-plateado que es el principal componente de las baterías de los autos de Tesla— es “el nuevo petróleo”. Tesla lleva mucho tiempo comprándole litio a Argentina, que es el segundo país con mayores reservas. Ahora, Milei presiona para que las mineras internacionales de litio reciban beneficios importantes, lo que probablemente le daría a Tesla un flujo más estable —y quizá más barato— de uno de los recursos más vitales para la empresa. Milei se ajusta a un patrón que sigue Musk de fomentar relaciones con una constelación de jefes de Estado de derecha, con beneficiarios muy claros: él mismo y sus empresas. Musk, de 52 años, ha utilizado en repetidas ocasiones una pieza de su imperio empresarial —la red social X— para expresar su apoyo a políticos como Milei, Jair Bolsonaro de Brasil y Narendra Modi de India. En la plataforma, Musk ha respaldado sus posturas en temas de género, ha celebrado su oposición al socialismo y ha confrontado con agresión a sus enemigos. Musk incluso cambió personalmente las políticas de contenido de la plataforma X de una forma que pareció beneficiar a Bolsonaro, según dijeron dos exempleados de la plataforma. Musk, a su vez, ha presionado y obtenido ventajas corporativas para sus empresas más lucrativas, Tesla y SpaceX, según un análisis de The New York Times. En India, logró que se le cobraran aranceles menores por la importación de los vehículos de Tesla. En Brasil, abrió un importante mercado nuevo para Starlink, el servicio de internet por satélite de SpaceX. En Argentina, aseguró el acceso al mineral más crucial para las baterías de Tesla. El respaldo de Musk les ha dado a muchos jefes de Estado nacionalistas y de derecha más prestigio internacional, el cual no han dudado en promocionar como una validación de sus políticas y popularidad. Musk, Tesla, SpaceX y la plataforma X no respondieron a nuestras solicitudes de comentarios. En septiembre de 2015, Musk recibió a Modi en la fábrica de Tesla en Fremont, California. Modi, político nacionalista indio, había sido electo primer ministro de India un año antes, cuando su partido, Bharatiya Janata, arrasó para llegar al poder, y visitaba Estados Unidos para reunirse con líderes empresariales. Musk y Modi posaron para las fotos cerca de un flamante automóvil rojo Model S. Comentaron que los “paneles solares y las baterías” podrían brindar electricidad a regiones rurales de India sin necesidad de líneas eléctricas, señaló Musk en ese entonces. “Comprendí su visión”, dijo más tarde Modi. Fue una de las primeras instancias en que Musk sostuvo una reunión en público con un líder nacionalista. Además, fue el principio de un plan a largo plazo con Modi, relación que tardó años en desarrollar y comenzó a redituarle a Musk después de que compró Twitter.. India podría ser un mercado masivo para Tesla, que necesita incursionar en regiones nuevas para crecer. Pero ese país prácticamente prohibió los vehículos eléctricos construidos por fabricantes extranjeros. En años recientes, los aranceles impuestos en India a los vehículos eléctricos importados han aumentado hasta un 100 por ciento. Musk recurrió en un principio a la diplomacia personal tradicional: se reunió con Modi y les ordenó a los empleados de Tesla estrechar relaciones con algunos funcionarios. Después de que Musk compró Twitter en 2022, aprovechó su nueva palanca. La plataforma, renombrada como X, se utiliza ampliamente en India —hasta Modi lo hace y tiene casi 98 millones de seguidores— y es un foro importante de debate político. Musk se reunió en persona con Modi de nuevo en junio pasado, cuando el primer ministro visitó Nueva York. Se identificó como “fan de Modi” y afirmó que Modi estaba “alentándonos a hacer inversiones significativas en India, algo que planeamos hacer”. Para entonces, los empleados de Tesla de nuevo sostenían conversaciones con los asesores de Modi sobre una reducción de los aranceles y una inversión en India, según indicaron dos personas familiarizadas con las conversaciones. Rohan Patel, quien era vicepresidente de política pública y desarrollo comercial de Tesla, viajó a India en varias ocasiones. Por su parte, Piyush Goyal, ministro de Comercio de India, visitó la fábrica de Fremont en noviembre. En enero, Musk publicó en X que India debería recibir un lugar permanente en el Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas, lo que reforzaría la posición internacional de India. “Que India no tenga un lugar permanente en el Consejo de Seguridad, a pesar de ser el país más poblado del planeta, es absurdo”, escribió Musk. Todo parece indicar que Modi se percató del comentario. Dos meses después, India anunció que había decidido reducir algunos aranceles de importación para los fabricantes de automóviles eléctricos que se comprometieran a asignar por lo menos 500 millones de dólares a la producción de vehículos en el país. La política redujo los aranceles del 100 al 15 por ciento del precio de cada automóvil, específicamente para los vehículos eléctricos con un precio superior a 35.000 dólares. La descripción se ajusta a Tesla a la perfección. Sus automóviles Model 3 tienen un precio de 38.990 dólares. Para 2021, Musk ya aplicaba una táctica similar para introducir el servicio de internet de su red de satélites Starlink en Brasil, gobernado en ese entonces por Bolsonaro, presidente populista de derecha elegido tres años antes. En esa época, Starlink estaba en pañales, con menos de 150.000 usuarios en 25 países. En octubre de 2021, Fábio Faria, ministro de Comunicaciones de Brasil y uno de los organizadores de la campaña de reelección de Bolsonaro, le envió una carta a Musk en la que le decía que “Starlink y Brasil pueden ser excelentes aliados”, según consta en correspondencia obtenida por las leyes de transparencia de información del país. Semanas más tarde, Faria visitó a Musk en Texas. Tras su regreso a Brasil, Faria presionó a los reguladores para que aprobaran a Starlink. En cierto momento, instó a la agencia espacial de Brasil a mantenerse al margen de cualquier debate sobre los satélites de SpaceX en el país, según testificó más adelante ante el Congreso Nacional de Brasil. Los reguladores de Brasil aprobaron la operación de Starlink en diciembre de 2021, siete meses después de presentada la primera solicitud del servicio. Fue la más rápida de las cinco aprobaciones que los reguladores les otorgaron a prestadores de servicios de internet por satélite. Musk ayudó más tarde a Bolsonaro, cuando enfrentó una difícil batalla en su campaña de 2022 por la reelección. El 20 de mayo de ese año, Musk hizo un viaje sorpresa a Brasil para hacer un anuncio importante con el presidente. Starlink iba a llegar al país y planeaba ofrecerles acceso a internet a 19.000 escuelas rurales, además del monitoreo ambiental de la Amazonía, según indicaron durante un evento en un complejo hotelero cerca de São Paulo. Bolsonaro le entregó a Musk una medalla y lo llamó una “verdadera leyenda de nuestra libertad” por su oferta de ese año para comprar Twitter.. Pero solo había un inconveniente: el plan de ofrecerles conexión a las escuelas nunca se concretó, explicó Carlos Baigorri, principal regulador de telecomunicaciones de Brasil, quien ayudó a aprobar el ingreso de Starlink en el país. “En realidad no creo que siquiera haya existido”, comentó acerca del plan. Musk y Bolsonaro se beneficiaron de cualquier manera. Musk había atrincherado a SpaceX en un mercado vital, en el que Starlink tiene ahora 150.000 cuentas activas, según la reguladora de telecomunicaciones de Brasil. La campaña de Bolsonaro logró promover la agudeza comercial del presidente y presentarlo como defensor de la Amazonía antes de las elecciones. El favor de Musk no evitó que Bolsonaro perdiera la presidencia ante Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, expresidente de izquierda de Brasil, en octubre de 2022. Pero en unas semanas, Musk, que acababa de concretar su acuerdo para comprar Twitter, intentó de nuevo ayudar a Bolsonaro. Los partidarios de Bolsonaro habían comenzado a impulsar acusaciones en Twitter de que algunos jueces brasileños habían inclinado la balanza en las elecciones cuando les ordenaron a las redes sociales eliminar publicaciones y cuentas con ideología de derecha. Mientras estaban instalados frente a bases militares para exigir la anulación de las elecciones, Musk alimentó sus sospechas dando a entender que los antiguos jefes de Twitter habían contribuido a la derrota de Bolsonaro. “Es posible que algunos empleados de Twitter les hayan dado preferencia a los candidatos de izquierda”, publicó en diciembre de 2022, sin mencionar ninguna evidencia. Más tarde, escribió que la empresa “quizá tenga personas en el equipo de Brasil con un fuerte sesgo político”. En 2022, uno de los proveedores de litio de Tesla anunció una inversión de 1100 millones de dólares para ampliar sus operaciones en Argentina. Desde entonces, Musk ha mostrado gran interés en la política argentina ―particularmente en Milei―, lo que ha generado uno de los bromances o “romance entre hermanos” más evidentes entre las relaciones políticas de Musk. Milei, economista libertario y comentarista de televisión, promovió durante su campaña la idea de sacar al gobierno de la economía y establecer una relación más estrecha entre Argentina y Estados Unidos. Al igual que Musk, insulta con frecuencia a sus críticos, tiene un hábito intenso con las redes sociales y está muy preocupado por la amenaza de la cultura progre. Unos días antes de la toma de posesión de Milei en diciembre, hablaron directamente por primera vez y Musk le preguntó sobre el litio de Argentina. En los meses posteriores, Milei ha impulsado legislación que haría mucho más atractiva la extracción de litio en Argentina para los inversionistas extranjeros. Su proyecto legislativo de gran envergadura, que le otorgaría, durante el año próximo, amplias facultades en situación de emergencia sobre la economía y la energía de Argentina, incluye un gran beneficio para Tesla: incentivos significativos para inversionistas extranjeros con proyectos grandes, en especial en la industria minera. Esas empresas recibirían recortes fiscales sustanciales, exenciones de impuestos aduaneros y beneficios de cambio de divisas, así como certidumbre fiscal y regulatoria por un periodo de 30 años. Es probable que califique el proveedor de litio de Tesla. En tal caso, el plan de Milei le daría a Tesla una estabilidad y predictibilidad inusuales en cuanto a su acceso a litio en Argentina por lo menos hasta 2054. La propuesta fue aprobada en la cámara baja del Congreso de Argentina el 30 de abril. Musk ya ha visto otros dividendos de Milei. En uno de sus primeros actos como presidente, Milei aprobó una orden ejecutiva con 366 disposiciones. Cuando sintetizó los puntos clave de la orden en un discurso por televisión, Milei mencionó solo una marca corporativa específica: Starlink. SpaceX había intentado lograr la aprobación de Starlink en Argentina desde 2022, pero estaba en un atolladero burocrático. Milei no tardó en reducir las regulaciones aplicables al internet por satélite, lo que le permitió a Starlink arrancar operaciones en el país en marzo.",unos minutos despus de que se hizo evidente que

nytimes,The Scrappy World War II Pilots Who Took Flight for a Perilous Mission,"May 14, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/books/review/skies-of-thunder-caroline-alexander.html,"“You and your outfit have been assigned one of the most important military missions ever given to American soldiers — the task of driving the Japanese back to Tokyo.” So begins “A Pocket Guide to India,” prepared for World War II service members in the western base section of the China-Burma-India Theater, commonly known as the C.B.I. “India is a strange, colorful land,” the guide continues. “If you exercise a normal amount of curiosity you’ll learn much that is fascinating; much that will enable you to begin stories to your children or grandchildren in later years, ‘Now, when I was in India. …’” If the guide seems to protest too much, perhaps that’s because the C.B.I. was, as Caroline Alexander explains in her riveting new book, “Skies of Thunder,” under-resourced, improvisational and rife with smugglers, its actual purpose murkier than its symbolic value. It was the war’s “most chaotic theater,” she writes, marked by “competing interests, and contradictions that exposed the fault lines between the Allies.” To some stationed there, C.B.I. stood for “Confusion Beyond Imagination.” My father, who served as an air traffic controller in the C.B.I., didn’t recall reading the “Pocket Guide,” but he did tell me stories of working in Delhi and Agra, a vital supply depot and service point, and traveling to various locations to lay radio-range beacons. The main point of these activities, he explained, was to enable pilots to fly supplies over the Himalayas to China. While it was always easy for me to picture my father in his control tower, those flights over the mountains remained mysterious until I read Alexander’s vivid account. Alexander, the author of books on Shackleton’s Endurance expedition and the fateful voyage of the Bounty, begins with the Allied loss of Burma to the Japanese in April 1942, which sealed off the ground supply corridor from India to China and led to the opening of an “aerial Burma Road.” This treacherous route, known as “the Hump,” supplied Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist government and Allied troops, including the 14th Air Force, commanded by the flamboyant Claire Chennault. Alexander casts her story as an “epic,” yet it is one in which the actors suffer like Job more often than they fight like Achilles. There are stirring episodes of British sang-froid, “American-style glamour” and remarkable courage among the region’s remote tribal peoples, but it is perseverance that assumes heroic proportions: refugees escaping through the Burmese jungle; soldiers and local laborers hacking through that same jungle to build a new road; Assam airfield personnel living in squalor, seared by the sun, swamped by monsoons, but most of all shrouded in a “miasma of cynical indifference.” What unites this book with the author’s previous work is a fascination with human behavior in extremis. While Alexander devotes considerable space to strategic and political issues, her interest lies primarily in the vicissitudes of individual human personality. In places she represents the theater’s dysfunction as a tragicomedy of failed relationships at the highest levels of command: between the mercurial Chiang Kai-shek and the American Joseph Stilwell, the theater’s irascible, insecure commanding general; between Stilwell and the unscrupulous, self-aggrandizing Chennault; between Stilwell and the British allies he loathed. Alexander’s gift for dramatizing these personal animosities occasionally produces seductive yet oversimplified biographical explanations of historical problems, a mode E.H. Carr described as “the Bad King John theory of history.” Ultimately, and rightly, the pilots — intrepid as “sailors of old” crossing “unknown oceans” — are the core of the book. Demeaned as “Hump drivers,” ostensible noncombatants at the bottom of the aviation hierarchy, they flew an inadequately charted route over baffling terrain, its surreality intensified by their frequent refusal to wear oxygen masks. Alexander adroitly explicates technical concepts — flight mechanics, de-icing, night vision — but is at her best rendering pilots’ fear. Besides terrain, its sources included weather, enemy aircraft, insufficient training, night missions and “short rations of fuel” on the return leg. At least a pilot could depend on his plane, the beloved Douglas C-47 Skytrain, until the introduction of unreliable or unsound higher-capacity models turned the machines themselves into another source of terror. Readers thrilled by sagas of flight will marvel at the logistics required to transport a stunning 650,000 tons of cargo by air, the audacity required to fly the Hump, the search-and-rescue operations necessitated by its hazards and the experimental use of aviation involved in the Allied recapture of Burma in 1944.

nytimes,14 Killed as Storm Topples Huge Billboard in India,"May 13, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/world/asia/mumbai-india-storm-deaths.html,"Fourteen people were killed in a suburb of Mumbai, India’s financial capital, on Monday as strong winds from a storm caused the collapse of a huge billboard that officials said had been erected without permission. At least 64 people were injured in the collapse, and rescue workers were searching for more survivors trapped under the debris on Tuesday morning. Videos on social media showed the billboard shaking in the storm before falling on a gas station. An eyewitness, Sunil Gaikwad, said he and his wife had taken shelter with dozens of others in the gas station, on a busy road in the Ghatkopar area, when the rain and wind worsened. Within minutes, he said, the billboard toppled onto the gas station and a parking area. “All of us were stuck for hours before people came and saved us,” Mr. Gaikwad said from a Mumbai hospital, where he was being treated for minor injuries. “It was like a huge building falling on top of us.” Mumbai, home to more than 18 million people, is prone to severe flooding and rain-related accidents during the monsoon season, which runs roughly from June to September. Last year, a landslide triggered by torrential rains killed at least 16 people in Maharashtra, the state that includes Mumbai. Across India, more than 2,000 people were killed last year because of floods and rain-related incidents during the monsoon season, according to data from India’s federal home ministry. Eknath Shinde, the chief minister of Maharashtra, ordered officials to check all billboard structures in Mumbai. His deputy, Devendra Fadnavis, said the government had opened an investigation into the collapse. The rains on Monday were followed by dust storms. The authorities at the Mumbai airport said they had diverted more than a dozen inbound flights and suspended operations for more than an hour. Though the rains brought some relief from the sweltering heat, many parts of the city were inundated, and there were large traffic jams.",fourteen people killed suburb mumbai india financial capital monday strong wind storm caused collapse huge billboard official said erected without permission least people injured collapse rescue worker searching survivor trapped debris tuesday morning video social medium showed billboard shaking storm falling gas station eyewitness sunil gaikwad said wife taken shelter dozen others gas station busy road ghatkopar area rain wind worsened within minute said billboard toppled onto gas station parking area u stuck hour people came saved u mr gaikwad said mumbai hospital treated minor injury like huge building falling top u mumbai home million people prone severe flooding rainrelated accident monsoon season run roughly june september last year landslide triggered torrential rain killed least people maharashtra state includes mumbai across india people killed last year flood rainrelated incident monsoon season according data india federal home ministry eknath shinde chief minister maharashtra ordered official check billboard structure mumbai deputy devendra fadnavis said government opened investigation collapse rain monday followed dust storm authority mumbai airport said diverted dozen inbound flight suspended operation hour though rain brought relief sweltering heat many part city inundated large traffic jam
nytimes,Elon Musk’s Diplomacy: Woo Right-Wing World Leaders. Then Benefit.,"May 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/technology/elon-musk-world-leaders.html,"Minutes after it became clear that Javier Milei had been elected president of South America’s second-largest nation in November, Elon Musk posted on X: “Prosperity is ahead for Argentina.” Since then, Mr. Musk has continued to use X, the social network he owns, to boost Mr. Milei. The billionaire has shared videos of the Argentine president attacking “social justice” with his 182 million followers. One doctored image, which implied that watching a speech by Mr. Milei was better than having sex, is among Mr. Musk’s most viewed posts ever. Mr. Musk has helped turn the pugnacious libertarian into one of the new faces of the modern right. But offline, he has used the relationship to press for benefits to his other businesses, the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX. “Elon Musk called me,” Mr. Milei said in a television interview weeks after taking office. “He is extremely interested in the lithium.” Mr. Musk has declared lithium — the silvery-white element that is the main component in Tesla’s car batteries — “the new oil.” Tesla has long bought lithium from Argentina, which has the world’s second-largest reserves. Now Mr. Milei is pushing for major benefits for international lithium miners, which would likely give Tesla a more stable — and potentially cheaper — flow of one of its most critical resources. Mr. Milei is part of a pattern by Mr. Musk of fostering relationships with a constellation of right-wing heads of state, with clear beneficiaries: his companies and himself. Mr. Musk, 52, has repeatedly used one piece of his business empire — X, formerly known as Twitter — to vocally support politicians like Mr. Milei, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Narendra Modi of India. On the platform, Mr. Musk has backed their views on gender, feted their opposition to socialism and aggressively confronted their enemies. Mr. Musk even personally intervened in X’s content policies in ways that appeared to aid Mr. Bolsonaro, two former X employees said. Mr. Musk, in turn, has pushed for and won corporate advantages for his most lucrative businesses, Tesla and SpaceX, according to an examination by The New York Times. In India, he secured lower import tariffs for Tesla’s vehicles. In Brazil, he opened a major new market for Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite internet service. In Argentina, he solidified access to the mineral most crucial to Tesla’s batteries. Mr. Musk’s endorsement has given many nationalist and right-wing heads of state more international cachet, which they have eagerly promoted as a validation of their policies and popularity. Last month, as India began holding an election, Mr. Modi prepared to host Mr. Musk in New Delhi, calling the billionaire’s visit a testament to his leadership. “People are coming, and they are trusting me,” the Indian prime minister said in a televised interview before Mr. Musk postponed his trip. Mr. Musk, Tesla, SpaceX and X did not respond to requests for comment. No other American megabillionaire businessperson has so publicly fostered ideological relationships with world leaders to advance personal politics and businesses. Bill Gates, Microsoft’s co-founder turned philanthropist, engaged in political diplomacy largely after stepping back from corporate life. Other chief executives typically stay quiet about meetings with politicians. Mr. Musk’s politics have long been guided by his businesses, said five former Tesla and SpaceX executives who worked closely with him and were not authorized to speak publicly. In the 2010s, he built an alliance with President Barack Obama as Tesla and SpaceX welcomed federal assistance and contracts. He remains close to some mainstream leaders, notably President Emmanuel Macron of France. But as populism and nationalism spread, Mr. Musk courted Xi Jinping in China and supported Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni. He began criticizing the “woke mind virus” and what he has declared the failings of the left, which he says have led to issues such as illegal immigration and declining birthrates. “I guess if you consider fighting the woke mind virus, which I consider to be a civilizational threat, to be political, then yes,” Mr. Musk said in a podcast in November when asked if he was becoming more political. “Woke mind virus is communism rebranded.” In September 2015, Mr. Musk welcomed Mr. Modi to Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif. Mr. Modi, a Hindu nationalist politician, had been elected India’s prime minister a year earlier when his Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power, and was visiting the United States to meet business leaders. Standing under Indian and U.S. flags at the factory, Mr. Musk and Mr. Modi posed for photographs near a gleaming red Model S car. They discussed how “solar panels and battery packs” could power rural regions in India without electrical lines, Mr. Musk said at the time. “I understood his vision,” Mr. Modi later said. It was one of the first instances of Mr. Musk’s publicly meeting a nationalist leader. And it was the beginning of a long game between him and Mr. Modi, a relationship that took years to develop — and that started paying off for Mr. Musk after he bought X. India is a potentially massive market for Tesla, which needs to expand to new regions to grow. But the country has virtually barred electric vehicles built by foreign manufacturers. In recent years, the tariff India imposes on imported electric vehicles has risen as high as 100 percent. Mr. Musk initially used traditional personal diplomacy, meeting with Mr. Modi and ordering his staff at Tesla to get close to officials. In 2017, Tesla sent a letter to India’s government to kick-start talks on operating in the country. Another overture to Mr. Modi’s government in 2019 was rebuffed, three people with knowledge of the company said. After Mr. Musk bought Twitter in 2022, he had a new lever. The platform, renamed X, is widely used in India — including by Mr. Modi, who has nearly 98 million followers — and is a major forum of political discussion. Before Mr. Musk owned the platform, Twitter tangled with Mr. Modi’s government. The company, which complies with requests to block certain content in India, had sued the government and challenged its power to censor online material. Under Mr. Musk, X blocked posts last year that linked to a BBC documentary examining Mr. Modi’s role in the 2002 Hindu-Muslim riots in Gujarat, where he was the chief minister at the time. Twitter’s lawsuit against the Indian government was dismissed in July. In a discussion last year with Twitter employees, Mr. Musk intimated that he was personally close with Mr. Modi. He said he could easily call the prime minister to take care of a content issue, two former employees said. It’s unclear if any conversation took place. Mr. Musk met Mr. Modi in person again last June when the prime minister visited New York. He called himself a “fan of Modi” and said Mr. Modi was “pushing us to make significant investment in India, which is something that we intend to do.” By then, Tesla employees were again talking with Mr. Modi’s advisers about a reduction in tariffs and investing in India, two people familiar with the conversations said. Rohan Patel, who was Tesla’s vice president of public policy and business development, traveled to India several times, and Piyush Goyal, India’s commerce minister, visited the Fremont factory in November. In January, Mr. Musk posted on X that India should receive a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, which would boost India’s international standing. “India not having a permanent seat on the Security Council, despite being the most populous country on Earth, is absurd,” he wrote. The timing suggests that Mr. Modi noticed. Two months later, India announced it was reducing some import duties for electric carmakers that committed at least $500 million to produce vehicles in the country. The policy dropped tariffs to 15 percent of a car’s price from 100 percent, specifically for electric vehicles that retail for more than $35,000. The description fit Tesla to a T. Its Model 3 cars ship at $38,990. BYD, the fast-growing Chinese electric vehicle maker, is barred from investing in India on national security grounds. Last month, Tesla scouted potential factory sites in three Indian states, three people familiar with the process said. Mr. Musk had also said he would visit Mr. Modi in New Delhi during the country’s multiweek general election, before delaying the trip, citing obligations with Tesla. Mr. Musk promised not to stay away for long. “I do very much look forward to visiting later this year,” he wrote on X. By 2021, Mr. Musk was employing a similar courtship to bring his Starlink satellite internet service to Brazil, which was then led by Mr. Bolsonaro, the right-wing populist president elected three years earlier. At the time, Starlink was in its infancy, with fewer than 150,000 users across 25 countries. In October 2021, Fábio Faria, Brazil’s communications minister and an organizer of Mr. Bolsonaro’s re-election campaign, sent a letter to Mr. Musk, saying that “Starlink and Brazil can become great partners,” according to correspondence obtained through the country’s open records laws. Weeks later, Mr. Faria visited Mr. Musk in Texas. After returning to Brazil, Mr. Faria pushed regulators to approve Starlink, at one point urging Brazil’s space agency to stay out of any debate about SpaceX’s satellites over the country, he later testified to Brazil's Congress. Brazil’s regulators approved Starlink for operation in December 2021, seven months after the service first applied. It was the fastest of five approvals that regulators granted to satellite internet providers. Mr. Musk later lent a hand to Mr. Bolsonaro, who faced an uphill battle in his 2022 re-election campaign. On May 20 that year, Mr. Musk made a surprise trip to Brazil for a major announcement alongside the president. Starlink was coming to the country, and it would provide internet connectivity to 19,000 rural schools, as well as environmental monitoring of the Amazon, they said at an event in a resort near São Paulo. Mr. Bolsonaro gave Mr. Musk a medal and called him a “true legend of freedom” for his bid that year to buy Twitter. There was just one catch: The plan to connect schools never materialized, said Carlos Baigorri, Brazil’s chief telecommunications regulator, who helped approve Starlink’s entry into the country. “I don’t really think that it even existed,” he said of the plan. Brazilian officials said they had no record of Starlink’s connecting Brazilian schools for free or conducting environmental monitoring. Mr. Musk and Mr. Bolsonaro benefited anyway. Mr. Musk had entrenched SpaceX in a critical market, where Starlink now has 150,000 active accounts, according to Brazil’s telecommunications regulator. Mr. Bolsonaro’s campaign got to promote the president’s business acumen and cast him as a defender of the Amazon before an election. Mr. Musk’s favor did not prevent Mr. Bolsonaro from losing the presidency to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s leftist former president, in October 2022. But within weeks, Mr. Musk, who had just completed his deal for Twitter, tried helping Mr. Bolsonaro again. Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters had started pushing accusations on Twitter that Brazilian judges had tilted the election by ordering social networks to remove right-wing posts and accounts. As they camped outside military bases demanding the election be overturned, Mr. Musk fed their suspicions by suggesting that Twitter’s former bosses had contributed to Mr. Bolsonaro’s defeat. “It’s possible that Twitter personnel gave preference to left wing candidates,” he posted in December 2022, without citing any evidence. He later wrote that the company “may have people on the Brazil team that are strongly politically biased.” Mr. Musk got involved in deciding which posts about Brazil’s election results should stay up or be taken down, two former Twitter employees said. Even after Mr. Musk was briefed about the risk of violence in Brazil that winter, he ordered employees to stop enforcing Twitter’s election rules in the country, including a policy forbidding users to spread misleading claims about election results, they said. He told them to remove only posts that directly incited violence or were subject to a court order. In January 2023, thousands of Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters stormed Brazil’s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices, under the false belief that the election had been stolen. Mr. Musk has since used X to attack one of Mr. Bolsonaro’s main political opponents, Alexandre de Moraes, a Brazilian Supreme Court justice who has overseen investigations into the former president and his supporters. X has blocked more than 100 accounts on orders from Justice Moraes, who has said many of them threatened Brazil’s democracy. “This judge has brazenly and repeatedly betrayed the constitution and people of Brazil,” Mr. Musk posted on X in April. “He should resign or be impeached.” At a rally called by Mr. Bolsonaro in Rio de Janeiro last month, his supporters held signs thanking Mr. Musk. When Mr. Bolsonaro addressed the crowd, he hailed the billionaire as “the man who really preserves true freedom for us all.” In 2022, one of Tesla’s lithium suppliers announced a $1.1 billion investment to expand in Argentina. Since then, Mr. Musk has taken a keen interest in Argentine politics — and particularly Mr. Milei — leading to one of the most pronounced bromances among Mr. Musk’s political relationships. Mr. Milei “would be quite a change,” Mr. Musk wrote on X in September in response to a post from the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who had called the then-candidate “Argentina’s next president.” Mr. Milei, a libertarian economist and TV pundit, campaigned on getting the government out of the economy and tying Argentina more closely to the United States. Like Mr. Musk, he frequently insults critics, has an intense social media habit and is deeply worried about the threat from “woke” culture. Days before Mr. Milei’s inauguration in December, they spoke directly for the first time, and Mr. Musk asked about Argentina’s lithium. In the months since, Mr. Milei has been pushing legislation that would make extracting Argentina’s lithium far more attractive to foreign investors. His sweeping bill, which would grant him broad emergency powers over Argentina’s economy and energy for the next year, includes a major benefit for Tesla: significant incentives for foreign investors in large projects, particularly in mining. Such companies would receive substantial tax cuts, customs exemptions and foreign-exchange benefits, as well as tax and regulatory certainty for the next 30 years. Tesla’s lithium supplier is likely to qualify. If so, Mr. Milei’s plan would give Tesla unusual stability and predictability in its access to lithium in Argentina until at least 2054. The proposal passed Argentina’s lower chamber of Congress on April 30. Mr. Musk has already seen other dividends from Mr. Milei. In one of his first acts as president, Mr. Milei passed an executive order with 366 provisions. When summarizing the highlights of the order in a televised address, Mr. Milei mentioned just one corporate brand by name: Starlink. SpaceX had pushed for Starlink’s approval in Argentina since 2022, but faced a bureaucratic jam. Mr. Milei quickly cut regulations on satellite internet, and Starlink began operating in the country in March. Mr. Milei, in turn, has benefited: Mr. Musk has become his most influential online promoter. In January, Mr. Musk shared videos of Mr. Milei’s speech at the World Economic Forum, in which the leader claimed communism and social justice were the main threats to the West. The posts set off a frenzy of praise for the Argentine across right-wing corners of the internet, including from Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who met with Mr. Milei in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington. Mr. Milei hugged Mr. Trump and told him he was rooting for him. Last month, Mr. Milei traveled to Austin, Texas, to visit Mr. Musk at Tesla’s factory there. The two men agreed to “open markets and defend the ideas of freedom,” according to a statement from Mr. Milei’s office. The statement did not mention lithium. Later, Gerardo Werthein, Argentina’s ambassador to the United States, told the Argentine newspaper La Nación that the pair had indeed discussed Argentina’s mineral reserves. Mr. Musk “had a very good view of everything we have,” Mr. Werthein said, “especially lithium.” On Monday, Mr. Musk and Mr. Milei met again, this time at a conference in Los Angeles. Mr. Milei called the entrepreneur “my friend” in a speech in which he praised Mr. Musk’s effort to reach Mars. A few hours later, Mr. Musk posted a photo of the two men with their thumbs up. “I recommend investing in Argentina,” he wrote.",minute became clear javier milei elected president south america

nytimes,"At Cannes, Indian Filmmakers Show There Is More Than Just Bollywood","May 11, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/11/movies/cannes-film-festival-india.html,"For the first time in 30 years at the Cannes Film Festival, an Indian film will compete for the Palme d’Or in the main competition, alongside new movies from Francis Ford Coppola, Yorgos Lanthimos and Andrea Arnold. The dry spell might come as a surprise for a country with film industries in multiple regions producing hundreds of films per year, including international sensations like last year’s Oscar-nominated “RRR.” But the inclusion of “All We Imagine as Light,” directed by Payal Kapadia, reflects a growing recognition of the independent cinema made in the shadow of the country’s mainstream hits. Thierry Frémaux, the artistic director of Cannes, noted the new generations of filmmakers in India when he announced the lineup in April. These movies offer what the critic Namrata Joshi calls “a young, probing, and provoking gaze at Indian reality.” Indian publications have celebrated the country’s prominent presence at the festival, whose inaugural edition in 1946 included a film from India, Chetan Anand’s “Neecha Nagar,” in its grand prize category. “All We Imagine as Light” joins a generally notable selection of Indian stories and storytellers across this year’s edition, which begins on Tuesday. Santosh Sivan will be the first Indian filmmaker to receive the Pierre Angénieux prize for career achievement in cinematography, and in the Un Certain Regard competition, Sandhya Suri’s “Santosh” follows a widow who takes on her husband’s policeman post. In Directors’ Fortnight, a parallel program during Cannes, Karan Kandhari’s “Sister Midnight” portrays a defiant newly married woman who seeks vengeance. And in ACID (Association for the Distribution of Independent Cinema) — a parallel program at Cannes devoted to independent film — an Indian feature will screen for the first time, “In Retreat,” directed by Maisam Ali. “It’s great because quite often we don’t have so many films from India represented in this way at Cannes,” Kapadia said in an interview from Paris where she was putting finishing touches on her film. Centering on two roommates, “All We Imagine as Light” is, Kapadia says, “about women who’ve come to Mumbai to work.” She returns to Cannes after winning best documentary in 2021 for her university-set reflection on love and protest, “A Night of Knowing Nothing.” But independent Indian productions can face a long road to screens at home because of domestic funding challenges and markets more accustomed to mainstream fare. “If you want to do something that’s a little experimental, it becomes challenging to find funding,” Kapadia said. “There are a few funds, but it’s a really big country and there are a lot of people.” Despite the obstacles, Indian films of modest budgets and artistic ambition have won awards abroad recently in major festivals like Sundance, “All That Breathes” in 2022; Rotterdam, “Pebbles” in 2021; and Venice, “The Disciple” in 2020. The Museum of Modern Art in New York opened a 2022 showcase of independent movies from India by proclaiming: “Indian cinema’s diversity has been energized by a growing number of impressive independent works.” And documentaries have especially garnered the spotlight recently with Academy Award nominations, including “All That Breathes” and “Writing with Fire,” despite having no consistent theatrical distribution within India. “I think the spirit of independent films in India has always been strong,” Deepti DCunha, artistic director of the Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival, said. “But very few people have the access and they can find it difficult to get their movies seen anywhere.” What’s helped many Indian filmmakers are co-productions with European countries, and the chance to get exposure to potential producers at the annual Film Bazaar, an event in Goa with a curated market for Indian films, producers and programmers visiting from abroad, and work-in-progress labs. But another nexus for a recent generation of independent filmmakers is film school. The Film and Television Institute of India (F.T.I.I.) in Pune, which Kapadia attended, is one such bastion, as is Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi. “The F.T.I.I. has provided an indefatigable supply of not only technicians in terms of editors, sound people, D.O.P.s [directors of photography] and so on, but also directors,” Shaunak Sen, who directed “All That Breathes,” said in an interview from Delhi. Sen counts himself lucky: his film about two brothers running a bird clinic in Delhi went to Sundance, Cannes and the Oscars, and was picked up by HBO. But he sees what independent filmmakers can face in India, “where you know you’re staring at this mammoth industry of Bollywood, working in a tiny nook, and trying to will a film into existence.” Kapadia’s film was in development since late 2018, taking time to find funding. She was writing the script for “All We Imagine as Light” while she was still making her documentary “A Night of Knowing Nothing.” The F.T.I.I. was central to Kapadia’s career, and where she met her partner, whom she also works with, and other “go-to film companions.” But an international connection was important: She worked on both films with a young French company, learning together as they moved from small documentary production to a sometimes 80-person crew for “All We Imagine as Light.” (“Big crew, small film!” she said with a laugh.) The French co-production also had support from the Netherlands through the Hubert Bals Fund of the International Film Festival Rotterdam, which supports filmmakers across the globe at various stages of creating their movies. “The independent film industry in Europe is really well designed. They support you at every stage,” Kapadia said, listing off grants for script writing, production, postproduction and distribution. She mused what it would be like if India could adopt the French system of levying taxes on ticket sales that can be used to support independent filmmaking. (She’s not alone in wondering: An editorial in the Indian Express said Kapadia’s inclusion offered “an opportunity to introspect on why it has taken three decades for a film from one of the world’s top film-producing nations to once again make it to this eminent stage.”) These are the challenges that filmmakers like Kapadia must master, not just to make their movies but to find audiences. Programmers at international festivals can help with encouraging independent voices, viewing works in progress in India or through links. In the case of the ACID selection, “In Retreat,” the filmmaker Ali (another F.T.I.I. graduate) submitted the film, which was one of hundreds considered by the programming team. Shot in the high-altitude Ladakh region, it’s the story of a middle-aged man trying to return home to a mountain town for his brother’s funeral. “I didn’t know the director was young, because when you see the film, it’s incredibly deep, really mature,” Pamela Varela, one of ACID’s programmers, said, before bestowing the highest auteurist compliment. “This is really a film by someone. You see it from the first sequence, which is amazing.” The up-and-coming generations of Indian independent filmmakers share a willingness to experiment formally and, outside of the demands of a studio and mass market, might have more freedom to confront political issues of inequality or caste, for example. “Especially if it’s a French co-production,” Kapadia said with a smile. “They are very much for free speech, so they are quite supportive of whatever you want to do.” These filmmakers find kinship both at home and abroad. Kapadia compared making films to “making a quilt, a craft” and mentioned the Indian filmmakers Yashaswini Raghunandan and Ekta Mittal. Like cinephiles globally, filmmakers are in tune with directors from across the world, though Sen also cited the particular “neighborly” bond with other South Asian cinemas that reflect a postcolonial modernity. When it comes to the independent “new wave,” though, don’t call it a comeback: By all accounts, the talent was always there. Cannes just presents a dazzlingly bright spotlight and opportunity. “I don’t think it is that we have recently seen a new wave in talent,” DCunha said. “It’s more that now Europe is paying attention, or America’s paying attention.”",first time year cannes film festival indian film compete palme dor main competition alongside new movie francis ford coppola yorgos lanthimos andrea arnold dry spell

nytimes,Canadian Arrests Highlight Alleged Gang Role in India’s Intelligence Operations,"May 4, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/world/asia/canada-india-sikh-arrests-gangs.html,"Months after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada accused India’s government of plotting a murder on Canadian soil — plunging diplomatic relations between the two countries to their lowest level ever — the first arrests in the killing, which came on Friday, did little to demystify the basis of his claim. The police didn’t offer clues or present any evidence that India had orchestrated the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh nationalist leader who was gunned down at the temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia, in June. What they did say was that three Indian men had committed the killing and that an investigation into India’s role was ongoing. Before the arrests, Indian officials had maintained that Canada was trying to drag New Delhi into what it described as essentially a rivalry between gangs whose members were long wanted for crimes back in India. After the arrests, a report from the CBC, Canada’s public broadcasting corporation, based on anonymous sources, also said the suspects belonged to an Indian criminal gang. But analysts and former officials said that the possible role of a gang in the killing does not necessarily mean the Indian government was not involved in the crime. India’s external spy agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, or RAW, has long been suspected of tapping into criminal networks to carry out operations in its immediate neighborhood in South Asia while maintaining deniability. Canada’s accusation, if proven, that India orchestrated the Nijjar killing — and a similar accusation made soon after by the United States in a different case — may suggest that RAW is now extending its playbook of working with criminals to carry out operations in Western countries, analysts said. U.S. officials have produced strong evidence in their accusation that an agent of the Indian government participated in a foiled attempt to assassinate a dual American-Canadian citizen. And Canada and allied officials have maintained that Canada has evidence supporting Mr. Trudeau’s claim that Indian agents carried out Mr. Nijjar’s killing. But the Canadian failure to reveal any evidence that India took part, nine months after Mr. Trudeau’s explosive allegation, leaves the killing of Mr. Nijjar in the realm of accusations and counter-accusation in what is a highly tense political environment in both countries, analysts said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been flexing his muscles as a nationalist strongman, pitching himself during his ongoing campaign for a third-term in office as a protector of India who would go as far as it takes to target security threats. During speeches, he has boasted about how his government eliminates enemies by “descending in their homes.” While he has made those references in relation to the country’s archenemy — Pakistan — right wing accounts on social media had celebrated the slaying of Mr. Nijjar in Canada as a similar reach of Mr. Modi’s long arm. Mr. Trudeau, on the other hand, had been facing criticism of weakness in the face of Chinese election interference activities on Canadian soil, and his getting ahead of the Nijjar killing was seen as compensating for that. Canadian police announced on Friday that they had arrested the three Indian men in Edmonton, Alberta, the same day and charged them with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the killing of Mr. Nijjar. The suspects had been living in Canada for three to five years but were not permanent residents of Canada, the police said. The gang that the CBC reported that the hit-men are connected to is led by Lawrence Bishnoi, 31, who is accused of several cases of murder, extortion and narcotics trafficking. He has orchestrated much of it from an Indian jail, where he has been held since 2014. His members are seen as being behind the murder of a popular Punjabi rapper, and threats of attacks on Bollywood celebrities. Indian security officials have frequently arrested criminals connected to Mr. Bishnoi, often with allegations that the gang’s network stretched as far as Canada and overlapped with those promoting from Canadian soil the cause of Khalistan, a once deeply violent separatist movement with the goal of carving out the Indian state of Punjab as an independent nation. A large Sikh diaspora resides in Canada, many of them having migrated there after a violent and often indiscriminate crackdown by the Indian government in the 1980s against the movement for an independent Khalistan. While the cause has largely died down inside India, it continues to have supporters among some segments of the diaspora. The Indian government has accused Canada, and several other Western countries, of not doing enough to crack down on the separatists. Analysts and former security officials said that in India’s immediate geographic neighborhood, RAW has often been willing to venture into murky spaces to recruit killers. Senior officials of Mr. Modi’s administration, including Ajit Doval, the storied former spymaster who now serves as his longtime national security adviser, have in the past been accused of reaching into the underworld to find hit men willing to go after targets both inside the country as well as abroad. Mr. Bishnoi has demonstrated enormous power from behind bars, even giving a television interview from jail last year to pitch himself as a nationalist warrior rather than a criminal mastermind. That, one former security official said, was a signal of his trying to align himself with the spirit of nationalism for a potential deal. “I am a nationalist,” Mr. Bishnoi said in that interview. “I am against Khalistan. I am against Pakistan.” Ajai Sahni, a security analyst who runs the South Asia Terrorism Portal in New Delhi, said the exploitation of criminal gangs by spy agencies to carry out operations with deniability was something that “happens all over the world.” “It is definitely possible for agencies like RAW to use gang rivalries instead of exposing their own covert operators,” Mr. Sahni added. “But just because that is generally how one would expect it to be done, it doesn’t necessarily mean we know this is exactly the case in Nijjar’s killing.” The failed plot on American soil had some of the sloppy hallmarks of an agency trying to extend an old playbook into a different, unfamiliar space. A U.S. indictment in November laid out evidence, including electronic communication and cash transactions between the hired hit man — who turned out to be an undercover cop — a boastful middleman, and an Indian intelligence handler whom The Washington Post recently identified as Vikram Yadav. The Indian government’s response suggested worry: India’s top diplomat said the action was not government policy, while the government announced an investigation into the matter and promised cooperation with the United States. Canada’s case has played out very differently. The country has not publicly disclosed any evidence backing up Mr. Trudeau’s claim, even as allied officials said in September that Canadian officials had found a “smoking gun”: intercepted communications of Indian diplomats in Canada indicating involvement in the plot. Indian officials have pushed back against Mr. Trudeau’s claims with the kind of aggression that suggested it either wasn’t involved or that it was confident of its deniability. The Indian government expelled Canadian diplomats, and doubled down by putting out a list of individuals on Canadian soil that it said were long wanted as part of what it described as a crime and terror nexus. Last week, officials in Mr. Modi’s government jumped on scenes of an event that Mr. Trudeau had attended to say it showed his accusations were simply to appease what they say is a Sikh vote bank for him. They pointed to videos of an event where Mr. Trudeau was the chief guest and where chants of “long live Khalistan” were shouted. Mr. Trudeau, in his speech, said he will always be there “to protect your rights and your freedoms, and we will always defend your community against hatred.” After the speech, the Indian foreign ministry summoned Canada’s second highest ranking diplomat in New Delhi to lodge a complaint. “His remarks to us illustrates once again the kind of political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism and people who practice violence,” Randhir Jaiswal, the foreign ministry spokesman, said at a news conference.",month prime minister justin trudeau canada accused india

nytimes,Biden Calls Japan and India ‘Xenophobic’ in Defending U.S. Immigration,"May 2, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/us/politics/biden-japan-india-immigration.html,"For months, President Biden has been under pressure to prove he can be tough at the border. But at a campaign reception on Wednesday night, he also tried to voice his commitment to America’s long history of immigration. He did so by taking a swipe at two of America’s partners, saying that Japan and India are struggling economically “because they’re xenophobic.” He said the two democratic countries, along with China and Russia, “don’t want immigrants.” “Immigrants are what makes us strong,” the president told the crowd of supporters. “Not a joke. That’s not hyperbole, because we have an influx of workers who want to be here and want to contribute.” The comments have the potential to be a diplomatic irritant for the administration, which has spent years courting the governments of both Japan and India as part of the president’s strategy to counter Chinese aggression in the region. Japan and India are two of the five allies Mr. Biden has hosted with state dinners at the White House since taking office. John F. Kirby, the national security spokesman at the White House, told reporters Thursday that Mr. Biden was trying to make a comment about America’s immigrant “DNA,” not insult other countries. And he insisted that officials in India and Japan understand that. “Our allies and partners know well in tangible ways how President Biden values them, their friendship, their cooperation,” Mr. Kirby said. But the president’s comments also underscore how Mr. Biden is trying to find a politically palatable balance on immigration as he seeks a second term in the White House. In response to anger from Republicans and Democrats about historic surges of migrants at the southern border, the president signed off on the most restrictive immigration legislation in years. That legislation stalled in Congress, but now Mr. Biden is considering whether to use his executive power to enact a severe crackdown on asylum on his own. At the same time, Mr. Biden is trying to assert the moral high ground on the country’s treatment of migrants by drawing a contrast with former President Donald J. Trump and his yearslong assault on immigration. During the 2020 campaign, Mr. Biden repeatedly attacked Mr. Trump for supporting what he called racist and xenophobic policies. On his first day in office, Mr. Biden proposed a comprehensive overhaul of the nation’s immigration system that would have expanded rights for immigrants. Many advocates for immigrants have said they expected explicit support for what the president called a “humane” approach to immigration to continue in Mr. Biden’s White House. But the reality has been more complicated. As the situation on the border worsened, demands for tougher action grew — even from the president’s Democratic allies in big cities like Chicago, New York and Denver. While Mr. Biden has proposed new legal options for some migrants to enter the United States, his policies and rhetoric have become more forceful. In January, as Congress was considering the immigration legislation, Mr. Biden said he was eager to use it to shut down the border. “If given that authority,” he said, “I would use it the day I sign the bill into law.” Maribel Hernández Rivera, the director of policy and government affairs for the border and immigration at the A.C.L.U., said Thursday that she hoped the president’s comments at the fund-raiser indicated that he was reconsidering some of those tougher proposals. “The first thing he did was propose immigration reform, right? So that was a good thing,” she said, referring to Mr. Biden’s early actions as president. “We also, unfortunately, have seen other policies that are not helpful, such as trying to limit asylum, access to asylum for vulnerable people.” She added: “Banning asylum in any way goes against both international and national domestic laws. That is not the solution.” On Thursday, Mr. Kirby sought to emphasize that the president believed in the importance of immigration to the economic success of the United States. “Look, I think the broader point that the president was making, and I think people all around the world recognize this, that the United States is a nation of immigrants and it’s in our DNA,” he said. “We’re better for it. We’re stronger for it. We’re not going to walk away from it. And that’s the broader point that he would make.”",month president biden pressure prove tough border campaign reception wednesday night also tried voice commitment america long history immigration taking swipe two america partner saying japan india struggling economically theyre xenophobic said two democratic country along china russia dont want immigrant immigrant make u strong president told crowd supporter joke thats hyperbole influx worker want want contribute comment potential diplomatic irritant administration spent year courting government japan india part president strategy counter chinese aggression region japan india two five ally mr biden hosted state dinner white house since taking office john f kirby national security spokesman white house told reporter thursday mr biden trying make comment america immigrant dna insult country insisted official india japan understand ally partner know well tangible way president biden value friendship cooperation mr kirby said president comment also underscore mr biden trying find politically palatable balance immigration seek second term white house response anger republican democrat historic surge migrant southern border president signed restrictive immigration legislation year legislation stalled congress mr biden considering whether use executive power enact severe crackdown asylum time mr biden trying assert moral high ground country treatment migrant drawing contrast former president donald j trump yearslong assault immigration campaign mr biden repeatedly attacked mr trump supporting called racist xenophobic policy first day office mr biden proposed comprehensive overhaul nation immigration system would expanded right immigrant many advocate immigrant said expected explicit support president called humane approach immigration continue mr bidens white house reality complicated situation border worsened demand tougher action grew even president democratic ally big city like chicago new york denver mr biden proposed new legal option migrant enter united state policy rhetoric become forceful january congress considering immigration legislation mr biden said eager use shut border given authority said would use day sign bill law maribel hernndez rivera director policy government affair border immigration aclu said thursday hoped president comment fundraiser indicated reconsidering tougher proposal first thing propose immigration reform right good thing said referring mr bidens early action president also unfortunately seen policy helpful trying limit asylum access asylum vulnerable people added banning asylum way go international national domestic law solution thursday mr kirby sought emphasize president believed importance immigration economic success united state look think broader point president making think people around world recognize united state nation immigrant dna said better stronger going walk away thats broader point would make
nytimes,"When My Mom Got Sick, This TV Show Kept Us Going","May 1, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/magazine/indian-idol-cancer.html,"Every family has its archetypes, so here’s mine: My dad and my brother and I are all miserable. None of us are quick to experience joy, and all for different reasons — my dad is irritable, my brother is anxious and I’m bitter. The three of us combined could make one moderately unwell person. Instead, we are planets that orbit a sun more optimistic than we could ever be, and we hope that some of that shine rubs off on us periodically. My mother believes in a positive ethos: that things invariably will improve, that everyone is trying their best, that it’s better to be surprised by harm than anticipating it all the time. In April 2023, I was laid off from my job, and she reassured me immediately. “Everything always works out,” she said. But for the first time, I noticed a slash of worry run across her face. It looked as if she was losing her radiance. I later learned that my mother had been hiding something important from my brother and me for a month: She’d had a biopsy to determine if she had breast cancer. Within weeks of her 69th birthday, she had a lumpectomy. The doctors told her she would need an exhausting surgery, and then exhaustive radiation. For a little under a year, she went through treatment, and steadily she changed — she became sour, nihilistic and impenetrably dark, just like the rest of us. I had never seen it before, and I didn’t know what to do with it other than try to change her mind. Who was this woman? Every few weeks I’d fly home to find my mother again. Cancer robbed my mom of most pleasures. Food was rendered tasteless at best and inedible at worst; she’d push a plate of cheese and crackers away like a child, pantomiming vomiting at every meal. Radiation gave her brain fog, so it was challenging for her to follow along in a book or a movie. She didn’t find anything on TV funny anymore. She didn’t find me very funny either. She was morose and weepy no matter what the day looked like. In her displeasure, she found only blips of joy. Rummy after lunch, a heating pad on the breast, wearing a mastectomy bra that I lied about and said was given to me free in order to avoid arguing about the cost. But nothing brought her consistent pleasure like the Hindi version of “American Idol.” New episodes aired twice a week, and we would record it and watch after dinner. Only during “Indian Idol” was she upright, eyes peeled, singing along. Having just wrapped its 14th season, “Indian Idol” has been on since 2004 and has aired 179 episodes. On the South Asian TV channel my parents paid a premium for (“This,” I used to grumble as a kid, “but not Cartoon Network?”), reruns seemed to play daily, for months. “How come no one is getting kicked off?” I asked my mom after seeing the same contestants on the show for three weeks straight. “Oh, it takes a while,” she said, which was a big deal. It was always a big deal when she spoke at all. “Everyone always seems to get the same number of votes.” If you watch “American Idol” — or “Canadian Idol,” as I did growing up — you’ll know that the most interesting parts of the show are the brutal, often cruel criticisms contestants face. But that doesn’t happen on “Indian Idol,” where every competitor is genuinely one of the most amazing singers you’ve ever heard (the show typically features contestants who very capably sing a catalog of vocally demanding Bollywood tunes). The show is structured in such a way that weeks can go by without an elimination — there are noncompetitive audition and coaching phases which stretch for long periods. Viewers, it seems, appreciate the chance to watch months and months of really excellent karaoke, no matter who wins at the end. I don’t like reality competition shows, but I grew to appreciate “Indian Idol.” I valued the repetition, week after week — the rules didn’t make sense, the music was redundant and there was no real tension. When I watched with my mom, the judges hardly spoke an ill word about anyone’s performance. In fact, there was no friction at all. The worst thing the show did was engage in some vague poverty porn, portraying most of its contestants as low-income desperates who think of nothing but family and religion. But I was grateful for the absence of conflict. We tuned in to a world where everyone was a winner. In the episodes we watched together, all the contestants survived another week. It was that sameness of “Indian Idol” that anchored us as we navigated the unpredictable reality of her illness: Would my mother eat today? Would her pain be so debilitating that she would wail through the afternoon? Would she sleep? Would the drugs make lucidity impossible? Is today a day for her, or for her cancer? Who cares! During “Indian Idol,” I could coax her with a THC edible or two, maybe a piece of fruit. Her eyes would open. We could forget that we had lost the routine we used to take for granted. My mother just turned 70, and is now in remission. I flew back home to see her for her birthday.

nytimes,India’s Master of Nostalgia Takes His Sweeping Vision to Netflix,"May 1, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/world/asia/netflix-heeramandi-bhansali.html,"In the small Bombay theater that showed big films, his father brought him — over and over again — to see the biggest of them all. With every one of his 18 viewings of “Mughal-e-Azam,” a hit 1960 musical about a forbidden romance between a prince and a courtesan, the young boy fell more in love. The rays of light, beamed in black and white, opened to him a world at once majestic and lost. The dialogue, crisp and poetic, lingered in his thoughts. The music swept him to places that only later in life would he fully understand. Bombay would eventually change, to Mumbai. India, cinema and music — they would all change, too. But more than half a century later, Sanjay Leela Bhansali — now 61 and a rare remaining master of the grand old style of Indian filmmaking — has not let go of his seat at that small cinema, Alankar Talkies, on the hem of the city’s red-light district. His mind remains rooted there even as his work moves beyond the theater walls. His latest project, released on Wednesday, is an eight-episode musical drama on Netflix that gives a “Game of Thrones” treatment to an exalted milieu of courtesans in pre-independence India. The show, “Heeramandi,” affords more space for Mr. Bhansali’s expansive and exacting approach than any two-hour movie. But it also presents a tricky challenge. How, with big-budget texture and color, do you bring the splendor and grandiosity of royalty — in his imagination, the courtesans lived like queens — to an audience that, at least in his home country of India, will largely be watching on tiny mobile screens? One answer is technical: more close-up shots. The other is personal: a vision all his own. With his decades of commercial success, he has the license to hold tight to the kind of cinema — song-filled nostalgia mixed with obsessive attention to light and detail — he fell in love with early, and forever. “I am still in Alankar Talkies,” he said in an interview last summer, between shoots. “I am seeing it on that big screen over there.” Outside, Mumbai was drenched in monsoon rains. Inside, under the hangar that covered the three-acre set, Mr. Bhansali was lost in a city born as much of imagination as research. Hundreds of workers had toiled for nearly 10 months to create his Lahore of the early 1900s. The furniture was vintage. The curtains and the miniature patterns on the corridor walls were hand-painted, then aged. The slogans on the city walls, the store signs — all calligraphy, aged and faded. When his friend Moin Beg brought him a 14-page concept for the project about 20 years ago, Mr. Bhansali sat on it. There were too many characters, too many things going on, for a feature film. In the years that followed, Mr. Bhansali felt as if he was training himself “to handle big scale.” He made successful films — more recently in a shrinking environment for artistic expression that made him the subject of violent attack — that dealt with dancing girls and royal courts. A consistent theme was complex, powerful, beautiful women. Another big step: He began creating the music for his own movies. Some of his deepest artistic questions since childhood were triggered by music. Through music came a belief that any artist is a 200-year-old or 300-year-old soul. The artistic process is a slow discovery of what the soul already knows. Inside Alankar Talkies, the boy would forget about the actors on the screen and be transported by the voice of the Indian singer Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. “Somewhere, the soul started responding to it,” he said, “‘that I kind of understand this, I know where my father is trying to take me because I’ve traveled somewhere in the past.’” His heart was set on “Heeramandi” because so much came together in one world: refined taste, classical music and dance, power politics and powerful women. Before independence in 1947, India was a collection of princely states under British rule. Elite patronage had given rise to quarters of courtesans, and an ecosystem of music, dance and fashion grew around them. Heeramandi was one such place in the city of Lahore, which after India’s partition became part of Pakistan. The Urdu-language writer Shorish Kashmiri described Heeramandi even in its decline as “an art gallery where the nights remain awake and the days sleep.” The Netflix series captures a Heeramandi where the courtesans know they are the last of their kind. But in Mr. Bhansali’s vision, their end is not a slow march to nothingness. He merges the women into the whirlwind of India’s freedom movement. “I always grant my characters a lot more than they actually deserved in life,” he said. “I wanted them to be bathed in fountains — big corridors and big mirrors, so that the reflections seem larger than life.” On his sets, it is complete surrender to a vision that keeps changing in Mr. Bhansali’s head. Some actors have described his process as torturous, his temper difficult. Others have likened it to film school. “What my role started as, and what it became — a lot of it happened on paper, and a lot of it happened on the set,” said Sonakshi Sinha, a lead actress in the series. Ms. Sinha was shooting two small segments that day. First was the final bit of a song. In its climax, Ms. Sinha’s character sways through a crowd of party guests in her drawing room, toward her veranda, drink in hand. She stares at a rival madam across the street, raises her glass and tosses it down. In take after take, Mr. Bhansali drove a point home: Every move, every gesture, had to be done so that the eyes, the glare, remained the focus. “If you arrive and just pour, then there is no joy,” he told Ms. Sinha. “Take a beat.” The segment they shot next demonstrated how Mr. Bhansali thinks, and how he obsesses. It was supposed to be simple: Ms. Sinha’s character would put out some candles, symbolizing a closing down at Heeramandi so the courtesans could join the freedom fight. During a bathroom break, Mr. Bhansali walked past a chandelier. As he stood at the urinal, he had a new vision: Ms. Sinha’s character would use a pulley to pull up the chandelier, wrapped in a drape, then walk away as the lights went out. It took five hours to light and complete the shot, for a 10-second scene. Frustrated that it was not quite right, Mr. Bhansali turned to what helps connect him to his abstraction: music. He asked an assistant to play an old song, a ghazal, on an iPad. The voice softly filled the air — then another take. When his father, a producer who never made it, was on his deathbed, he had a peculiar request: He dispatched his son to get a cassette of a tribal singer who, after India was split, had ended up on the other side, where their own family had roots. He wanted to hear the song “Hayo Raba” by Reshma — a voice raw, untrained. By the time young Sanjay returned with the cassette, his father was unconscious. He stood there watching his dilated eyes — a scene that still plays out in his mind. “He had gone into a coma,” Mr. Bhansali said. “I had no place to play ‘Hayo Rabba,’ and my mother kept saying, ‘Play “Hayo Rabba”!’” Why that song? The closest he comes to an answer is that in his father’s state of hallucination, he was connecting with his ancestors. “Life is so fascinating,” he said. “Can films ever capture this?” He has spent his life seeing if it can. When he was about 6, his father took him to a film set. He told him to wait in a corner while he talked to his friends. A cabaret was being shot. “A skimpily dressed woman was eating an apple and throwing it on a semi-naked man,” he recalled. As he looked up — to the catwalk with hanging ropes and lights and screens — he was lost in wonderment. “I realized I don’t want to be on the cricket ground, I don’t want to be in school, I don’t want to be anywhere. I want to be here. This is my place,” he said. “That woman biting that apple, throwing it on the man — I think that kid was seduced.”",small bombay theater showed big film father brought see biggest every one viewing

nytimes,Australian Journalist Says She Was Pushed Out of India,"April 24, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/world/asia/india-australia-journalist-avani-dias.html,"A senior journalist with Australia’s national broadcaster says she was effectively pushed out of India after her reporting on Sikh separatism angered the Indian government, accusing the authorities of hindering her from going to events, seeking to have her reporting taken down and refusing for weeks to renew her visa. Avani Dias, the South Asia correspondent for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, said on social media that Indian officials told her last month that her application for a resident journalist visa extension would not be approved because a television segment she had produced on accusations that India was responsible for the killing of a Sikh activist in Canada had “crossed the line.” She was eventually granted a temporary visa extension at the last minute after lobbying by the Australian government, less than a day before she was scheduled to leave the country, Ms. Dias said in her podcast, “Looking for Modi.” But she said that she ultimately decided to leave because “it felt too difficult to do my job in India.” “I was struggling to get into public events run by Modi’s party,” Ms. Dias said on the podcast, which was about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Indian government has disputed Ms. Dias’ account and said she was assured by high ranking officials that her visa would be renewed. Her departure came amid a broader crackdown on free speech in the country and raids on journalists reporting on sensitive topics. During his 10 years leading the nation, Mr. Modi has consolidated power in India and across its institutions, challenging the founding principles of modern India, like secularism and freedom of the press. He is seeking a third term in parliamentary elections that begun this month. In March, Ms. Dias produced a television segment about the accusations made by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada last year that agents acting on behalf of the Indian government were behind the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist, on Canadian soil. The half-hour documentary examined the movement, which advocates for a separate Sikh state called Khalistan to be carved out of the Indian state of Punjab. During the half-hour documentary, which was broadcast in Australia and uploaded on social media, she detailed how permission for her and her crew to film at the border between Punjab and Pakistan had suddenly been revoked by Indian officials without explanation, and how she had been quizzed by Indian officials about her crew and the places she had visited to report on the story. “It’s clear that we’re being really monitored and that there’s concern about the story that we’re doing,” she said. On March 26, less than a week after the documentary was broadcast, the Indian government successfully sought to have YouTube block the video from showing in India. The next day, Ms. Dias was told by a representative of the Ministry of External Affairs that her application for a visa extension would not be renewed, according to a person directly familiar with the situation but who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the issue. Ms. Dias notified the Australian government, and Australian diplomats began to lobby for her visa, the person said. After weeks of bureaucratic back and forth, Ms. Dias received her visa extension on the evening of Apr. 18, the person said. But with her flight back to Australia departing the next day, and having already packed up her life in India, she made the decision to leave, Ms. Dias said in her podcast. She left on the first day of voting in India’s national election. A senior Indian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, refuted her account, saying Ms. Dias had been told well in advance that her visa would be extended. The official said that Ms. Dias had violated terms of her previous visa by attempting to film at the India-Pakistan border, which requires permission. Ms. Dias previously said she had sought and been granted that permission before it was revoked at the last minute. Ms. Dias had not been prevented from covering India’s election, but had her accreditation delayed because she had not yet received her visa extension, the Indian official said, adding that her colleagues at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation had been given accreditation to cover the elections. Ms. Dias’ departure adds to mounting concerns about press freedom in India, where Indian journalists have come under heavy pressure from the Modi administration. Foreign journalists in India are reporting more pressure, as well. In February, Vanessa Dougnac, a French freelance correspondent, said she had been forced to leave India, where she had lived for 25 years, after the authorities told her that they intended to withdraw her permanent residency permit. The authorities accused her of producing reporting that was “malicious and critical in manner,” and creating a “biased negative perception about India.” They said that she had worked as a journalist without holding a valid permit, after revoking her work permit in September 2022 without a clear reason.",senior journalist australia national broadcaster say effectively pushed india reporting sikh separatism angered indian government accusing authority hindering going event seeking reporting taken refusing week renew visa avani dia south asia correspondent australian broadcasting corporation said social medium indian official told last month application resident journalist visa extension would approved television segment produced accusation india responsible killing sikh activist canada crossed line eventually granted temporary visa extension last minute lobbying australian government le day scheduled leave country m dia said podcast looking modi said ultimately decided leave felt difficult job india struggling get public event run modis party m dia said podcast prime minister narendra modi indian government disputed m dia account said assured high ranking official visa would renewed departure came amid broader crackdown free speech country raid journalist reporting sensitive topic year leading nation mr modi consolidated power india across institution challenging founding principle modern india like secularism freedom press seeking third term parliamentary election begun month march m dia produced television segment accusation made prime minister justin trudeau canada last year agent acting behalf indian government behind killing hardeep singh nijjar sikh separatist canadian soil halfhour documentary examined movement advocate separate sikh state called khalistan carved indian state punjab halfhour documentary broadcast australia uploaded social medium detailed permission crew film border punjab pakistan suddenly revoked indian official without explanation quizzed indian official crew place visited report story clear really monitored there concern story said march le week documentary broadcast indian government successfully sought youtube block video showing india next day m dia told representative ministry external affair application visa extension would renewed according person directly familiar situation spoke condition anonymity sensitive nature issue m dia notified australian government australian diplomat began lobby visa person said week bureaucratic back forth m dia received visa extension evening apr person said flight back australia departing next day already packed life india made decision leave m dia said podcast left first day voting india national election senior indian official speaking condition anonymity refuted account saying m dia told well advance visa would extended official said m dia violated term previous visa attempting film indiapakistan border requires permission m dia previously said sought granted permission revoked last minute m dia prevented covering india election accreditation delayed yet received visa extension indian official said adding colleague australian broadcasting corporation given accreditation cover election m dia departure add mounting concern press freedom india indian journalist come heavy pressure modi administration foreign journalist india reporting pressure well february vanessa dougnac french freelance correspondent said forced leave india lived year authority told intended withdraw permanent residency permit authority accused producing reporting malicious critical manner creating biased negative perception india said worked journalist without holding valid permit revoking work permit september without clear reason
nytimes,Why Did Modi Call India’s Muslims ‘Infiltrators’? Because He Could.,"April 23, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/world/asia/india-modi-muslims.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his power at home secured and his Hindu-first vision deeply entrenched, has set his sights in recent years on a role as a global statesman, riding India’s economic and diplomatic rise. In doing so, he has distanced himself from his party’s staple work of polarizing India’s diverse population along religious lines for its own electoral gain. His silence provided tacit backing as vigilante groups continued to target non-Hindu minority groups and as members of his party routinely used hateful and racist language, even in Parliament, against the largest of those groups, India’s 200 million Muslims. With the pot kept boiling, Mr. Modi’s subtle dog whistles — with references to Muslim dress or burial places — could go a long way domestically while providing enough deniability to ensure that red carpets remained rolled out abroad for the man leading the world’s largest democracy. Just what drove the prime minister to break with this calculated pattern in a fiery campaign speech on Sunday — when he referred to Muslims by name as “infiltrators” with “more children” who would get India’s wealth if his opponents took power — has been hotly debated. It could be a sign of anxiety that his standing with voters is not as firm as believed, analysts said. Or it could be just a reflexive expression of the kind of divisive religious ideology that has fueled his politics from the start. But the brazenness made clear that Mr. Modi sees few checks on his enormous power. At home, watchdog institutions have been largely bent to the will of his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. Abroad, partners increasingly turn a blind eye to what Mr. Modi is doing in India as they embrace the country as a democratic counterweight to China. “Modi is one of the world’s most skilled and experienced politicians,” said Daniel Markey, a senior adviser in the South Asia program at the United States Institute of Peace. “He would not have made these comments unless he believed he could get away with it.” Mr. Modi may have been trying to demonstrate this impunity, Mr. Markey said, “to intimidate the B.J.P.’s political opponents and to show them — and their supporters — just how little they can do in response.” The prime minister sees himself as the builder of a new, modern India on the march toward development and international respect. But he also wants to leave a legacy that is distinctly different from that of the leaders who founded the country as a secular republic after British colonial rule. Before joining its political offshoot, he spent more than a decade as a cultural foot soldier of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., a right-wing organization founded in 1925 with the mission of making India a Hindu state. The group viewed it as treason when an independent India agreed to a partition that created Pakistan as a separate nation for Muslims, embraced secularism and gave all citizens equal rights. A onetime member went so far as to assassinate Mohandas K. Gandhi in outrage. Over his decade in national power, Mr. Modi has been deeply effective in advancing some of the central items of the Hindu-right agenda. He abolished the semi-autonomy of the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir. He enacted a citizenship law widely viewed as prejudiced against Muslims. And he helped see through the construction of a grand temple to the Hindu deity Ram on a plot long disputed between Hindus and Muslims. The violent razing in 1992 of the mosque that had stood on that land — which Hindu groups said was built on the plot of a previous temple — was central to the national movement of Hindu assertiveness that ultimately swept Mr. Modi to power more than two decades later. More profoundly, Mr. Modi has shown that the broader goals of a Hindu state can largely be achieved within the bounds of India’s constitution — by co-opting the institutions meant to protect equality. Officials in his party have a ready rebuttal to any complaint along these lines. How could Mr. Modi discriminate against anyone, they say, if all Indian citizens benefit equally from his government’s robust welfare offerings — of toilets, of roofs over heads, of monthly rations? That argument, analysts say, is telling in showing how Mr. Modi has redefined democratic power not as leadership within checks and balances, but as the broad generosity of a strongman, even as he has redefined citizenship in practice to make clear there is a second class. Secularism — the idea that no religion will be favored over any other — has largely been co-opted to mean that no religion will be allowed to deny Hindus their dominance as the country’s majority, his critics say. Officials under Mr. Modi, who wear their religion on their sleeves and publicly mix prayer with politics, crack down on public expressions of other religions as breaching India’s secularism. While right-wing officials promote conversion to Hinduism, which they describe as a “return home,” they have introduced laws within many of the states they govern that criminalize conversion from Hinduism. Egged on by such leaders, Hindu extremists have lynched Muslim men accused of transporting cows or beef and hounded them over charges of “love jihad” — or luring Hindu women. Vigilantes have frequently barged into churches and accosted priests they believe have engaged in proselytizing or conversion. “What they have done is to create a permissive environment which encourages hate and valorizes hate,” said Harsh Mander, a former civil servant who is now a campaigner for social harmony. In reference to Mr. Modi’s speech on Sunday, he added: “This open resort to this kind of hate speech will only encourage that hard-line Hindu right in society.” Tom Vadakkan, a spokesman for the B.J.P., said the prime minister’s comments on Muslims had been misinterpreted. Mr. Modi, Mr. Vadakkan said, was referring to “intruders” or “illegal migrants” who the party claims are being used by the political opposition to “redefine the demography.” Privately, Western diplomats in New Delhi do little to hide their discomfort with some of Mr. Modi actions as a democratic ally, from the targeting of minorities to his crackdowns on opposition and dissent. But they acknowledge that he is exploiting a particularly open season in the global order, with many of their own capitals providing a less positive example than they once did, and with so much focus on China and trade deals. Mr. Markey, the Washington-based analyst, said the U.S. government was holding back from voicing concerns publicly for several reasons beyond its national interest in having India serve as an economic and geopolitical counterweight to China. The United States, he said, realizes the growing limits of its public criticism in changing partner nations’ behavior. That was demonstrated most recently by the repeated instances in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel ignored President Biden’s demands that the Israeli military change its conduct within the war in Gaza. Criticism of Mr. Modi, Mr. Markey added, could also backfire for U.S. politicians who “do not want to get crosswise with Indian diaspora groups.” But Mr. Modi may not remain immune as he pursues closer partnerships with the United States in areas like joint weapons manufacturing, transfer of high technology and sharing of intelligence. “My sense is that Washington’s increasing discomfort with Modi’s domestic politics is gradually lowering the ceiling of potential U.S. cooperation with India,” Mr. Markey said. “The question is just how far Washington is willing to trust India. Will India be treated as an ally in everything but name, or as a partner more like Vietnam or Saudi Arabia?”",prime minister narendra modi power home secured hindufirst vision deeply entrenched set

nytimes,Modi Calls Muslims ‘Infiltrators’ Who Would Take India’s Wealth,"April 22, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/world/asia/modi-speech-muslims.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday called Muslims “infiltrators” who would take India’s wealth if his opponents gained power — unusually direct and divisive language from a leader who normally lets others do the dirtiest work of polarizing Hindus against Muslims. Mr. Modi, addressing voters in the state of Rajasthan, referred to a remark once made by Manmohan Singh, his predecessor from the opposition Indian National Congress Party. Mr. Singh, Mr. Modi claimed, had “said that Muslims have the first right to the wealth of the nation. This means they will distribute this wealth to those who have more children, to infiltrators.” Mr. Modi aimed his emotional appeal at women, addressing “my mothers and sisters” to say that his Congress opponents would take their gold and give it to Muslims. Implications like these — that Muslims have too many babies, that they are coming for Hindus’ wives and daughters, that their nationality as Indian is itself in doubt — are often made by representatives of Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. Mr. Modi’s use of such language himself, as he campaigns for a third term in office, raised alarm that it could inflame right-wing vigilantes who target Muslims, and brought up questions about what had prompted his shift in communication style. Usually, Mr. Modi avoids even using the word “Muslims,” coyly finding ways to refer indirectly to India’s largest minority group, of 200 million people. Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the Congress party, called Mr. Modi’s remarks “hate speech.” Asaduddin Owaisi, who represents the only national party for Muslims, lamented how “common Hindus are made to fear Muslims while their wealth is being used to enrich others.” Tom Vadakkan, a spokesman for the B.J.P., said that Mr. Modi’s speech was being misinterpreted. “This is not about our compatriots, the Muslims,” he said. Mr. Modi was talking only about “infiltrators,” according to Mr. Vadakkan. The prime minister’s fiery oration, delivered in 100-degree heat in the town of Banswara in arid Rajasthan, marked a contrast to the image he presents in international contexts. During a visit to the White House in June, Mr. Modi said there was “no question of discrimination” in India. When he played host to the Group of 20 summit in New Delhi three months later, he chose the theme “the world is one family”(in Sanskrit, the primary liturgical language of orthodox Hinduism). He put his own face on soft-power outreach programs like World Yoga Day, broadcast to Times Square, using it to present a Hindu-centric India as a benign “teacher to the world.” Campaigns that divide Hindus and Muslims can be useful in animating the hard-right Hindu base of Mr. Modi’s otherwise broad-based electorate, especially in places like Banswara, where Hindus outnumber Muslims by three to one. With his remarks, Mr. Modi may have been trying to close a divide that has opened among Hindus in Rajasthan over whether to support the B.J.P., with one prominent group holding protests over comments made by a party official. But the prime minister’s speech was also clearly intended for a wider audience; he shared a clip on his official social media channels. The B.J.P. remains the favorite to win another parliamentary majority when six weeks of voting concludes on June 1 and ballots are counted three days later. Mr. Kharge, the Congress party president, called Mr. Modi’s speech — perhaps hopefully — a sign of desperation, adding that opposition candidates must be faring well in the early stages of balloting. Neerja Chowdhury, a columnist and the author of “How Prime Ministers Decide,” echoed Mr. Kharge, saying that, in her view, “voters are expressing their dissatisfaction much more openly this time.” The B.J.P. is capable of a swift course correction, she added, because “they get feedback very quickly.” Rahul Gandhi, the public face of the Congress party, said that Mr. Modi’s comments had been intended as a diversion from subjects that trouble ordinary voters, like joblessness and inflation. That the prime minister alluded to religion at all in his speech drew complaints that he may have violated India’s election rules. Candidates are supposed to be barred from asking for votes in the name of religion or caste. But B.J.P. leaders regularly invoke Hindu deities during campaign rallies. The country’s Election Commission, which enforces the rules, has taken little action against the party, even as it has moved against members of other parties in similar cases. Uddhav Thackeray, a former ally of Mr. Modi’s who is now running against the B.J.P., declared that he would now ignore an Election Commission order to remove the word “Hindu” from his own party’s campaign song. The basis for Mr. Modi’s attack was a 22-second excerpt from a statement that Mr. Singh, a Sikh economist who was the prime minister before Mr. Modi, made in 2006. Mr. Singh had been listing many of the traditionally disadvantaged groups in India, including lower-caste Hindus and tribal populations, and “in particular the Muslim community,” and said that all should share equitably in the nation’s wealth. Since Mr. Modi took office in 2014, Muslims haven’t had a proportional share of India’s steady economic and social development. Just one of the 430 candidates the B.J.P. is fielding in the current election is Muslim. Mr. Singh’s speech from 2006 seems old now, but it was made just four years after riots in the state of Gujarat under the watch of Mr. Modi.

nytimes,‘Discomfort May Increase’: Asia’s Heat Wave Scorches Hundreds of Millions,"April 22, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/world/asia/heatwave-india-bangladesh.html,"Hundreds of millions of people in South and Southeast Asia were suffering on Monday from a punishing heat wave that has forced schools to close, disrupted agriculture, and raised the risk of heat strokes and other health complications. The weather across the region in April is generally hot, and comes before Asia’s annual summer monsoon, which dumps rain on parched soil. But this April’s temperatures have so far been unusually high. In Bangladesh, where schools and universities are closed this week, temperatures in some areas have soared above 107 degrees Fahrenheit, or 42 degrees Celsius. Those numbers don’t quite capture how extreme humidity makes the heat feel even worse. “Due to increasing moisture incursion, the discomfort may increase” over the next 72 hours, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department said in a notice on Monday. In Dhaka, the capital, the humidity was 73 percent, and many areas in the country have experienced daily power outages. The heat wave could lead to more cases of certain diseases, including cholera and diarrhea, said Be-Nazir Ahmed, a public health expert in Bangladesh and a former director of the national Directorate General of Health Services. Mr. Ahmed said that people should ideally try to work earlier in the morning and later at night, when temperatures are lower. But that is easier said than done in a country where many people work outdoors. Nur-e-Alam, who pulls a rickshaw by hand in Dhaka’s Mogbazar area, said he had scaled back to five to seven hours a day, down from eight to 10, because of the heat. His earnings have taken a hit. He expected to make 500 to 600 takas, or about $5, on Monday, about half his usual wage. “I haven’t experienced heat like this before,” Mr. Alam said. “Every year gets hotter, but this year is extreme.” The heat wave poses similar challenges in neighboring India, where extreme temperatures have strained power grids, forced school closures, and threatened the production of wheat and other crops. Temperatures in some areas did not dip below 108 degrees Fahrenheit last weekend. The national meteorological department said on Sunday that it expected heat wave conditions in some states for another five days. The heat has collided with the start of India’s six-week general election, in which nearly a billion people are eligible to vote. The election authorities are working to provide water on voting days, and some political parties are bringing water and cooling devices to campaign rallies. Extreme heat also has a political dimension in Myanmar, where the ruling military junta cited soaring temperatures last week as justification for moving Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the country’s ousted civilian leader, from prison to an undisclosed location. Many people in Myanmar believe that generals are moving her for other reasons but using the heat — the capital recently hit 114.8 degrees Fahrenheit — as a pretext. Asia’s heat wave isn’t happening in a meteorological vacuum. Last year was Earth’s warmest by far in a century and a half. And the region is in the middle of an El Niño cycle, a climate phenomenon that tends to create warm, dry conditions in Asia. Asia’s summer monsoon will bring relief, but it’s still weeks away. In Thailand on Monday, the national forecast called for “hot to very hot weather.” It put the chances of rain in Bangkok, the capital, at zero percent.",hundred million people south southeast asia suffering monday punishing heat wave forced school close disrupted agriculture raised risk heat stroke health complication weather across region april generally hot come asia annual summer monsoon dump rain parched soil april temperature far unusually high bangladesh school university closed week temperature area soared degree fahrenheit degree celsius number dont quite capture extreme humidity make heat feel even worse due increasing moisture incursion discomfort may increase next hour bangladesh meteorological department said notice monday dhaka capital humidity percent many area country experienced daily power outage heat wave could lead case certain disease including cholera diarrhea said benazir ahmed public health expert bangladesh former director national directorate general health service mr ahmed said people ideally try work earlier morning later night temperature lower easier said done country many people work outdoors nurealam pull rickshaw hand dhaka mogbazar area said scaled back five seven hour day eight heat earnings taken hit expected make taka monday half usual wage havent experienced heat like mr alam said every year get hotter year extreme heat wave pose similar challenge neighboring india extreme temperature strained power grid forced school closure threatened production wheat crop temperature area dip degree fahrenheit last weekend national meteorological department said sunday expected heat wave condition state another five day heat collided start india sixweek general election nearly billion people eligible vote election authority working provide water voting day political party bringing water cooling device campaign rally extreme heat also political dimension myanmar ruling military junta cited soaring temperature last week justification moving daw aung san suu kyi country ousted civilian leader prison undisclosed location many people myanmar believe general moving reason using heat capital recently hit degree fahrenheit pretext asia heat wave isnt happening meteorological vacuum last year earth warmest far century half region middle el nio cycle climate phenomenon tends create warm dry condition asia asia summer monsoon bring relief still week away thailand monday national forecast called hot hot weather put chance rain bangkok capital zero percent
nytimes,India to Redo Voting at Polling Stations Hit by Violence,"April 21, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/21/world/asia/india-presidential-election-voting-manipur.html,"India’s election authorities have directed officials to redo voting at several polling places in the troubled northeastern state of Manipur, after armed men attacked polling stations and captured voting booths despite the presence of dozens of paramilitary soldiers. The state of Manipur has endured ethnic conflict for months after a dispute erupted over who gets to claim a tribal status that grants extra privileges, for example preferential treatment in seeking government jobs. The conflict, which began last May, has essentially split the region, home to about three million people, pitting two ethnic groups against each other: the mostly Hindu Meiteis, who form a narrow majority, and members of Christian hill tribes known as Kukis. More than 200 people have been killed, members of both groups. Thousands were internally displaced and still fear returning to places they once called home, seeking refuge in squalid camps. The Election Commission of India said on Saturday that voting would be done again on Monday in 11 polling stations where voting had been held on Friday. The order came after the region’s top election commissioner wrote to his agency describing mob violence, gunfire, damage to electronic voting machines and bogus voters entering the booths. Video footage from the Inner Manipur constituency, one of the two seats in the state for the lower house of Parliament, showed mobs raiding a polling station and breaking electronic voting machines. At another station, members of an armed gang were seen threatening voters. One women said that when she arrived to vote, she found that the votes of her entire family had already been cast. One person was also injured by gunfire. Tens of thousands of soldiers have been deployed to prevent violence in different parts of the country, as the voting continues till June 1 to elect the country’s next prime minister. Local residents in Manipur said that soldiers had tried to keep order but were overpowered by people, mostly women, who rushed into the voting booths, and intimidated by the presence of armed men. Members of opposition political groups say the problems were not confined to the 11 polling places that will get a do-over, and are calling for new voting in more than 45 polling booths in 12 areas of Manipur. Keisham Meghachandra, a top leader of the opposition Indian National Congress in Manipur, said that members of armed gangs supportive of the incumbent government had threatened candidates and voters the day before the elections and on the day of polling even fired at a polling station. “It was mass rigging,” Mr. Meghachandra said. “Violence happened in places where majority of voters are unhappy with both local and Modi government.” Manipur is run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party and led by Nongthombam Biren Singh. An adviser to Mr. Singh, the state’s chief minister, did not answer calls on Sunday. Across India, the first phase of voting took place on Friday in 102 parliamentary seats, but six phases still remain, with results to be announced on June 4.",india election authority directed official redo voting several polling place troubled northeastern state manipur armed men attacked polling station captured voting booth despite presence dozen paramilitary soldier state manipur endured ethnic conflict month dispute erupted get claim tribal status grant extra privilege example preferential treatment seeking government job conflict began last may essentially split region home three million people pitting two ethnic group mostly hindu meiteis form narrow majority member christian hill tribe known kuki people killed member group thousand internally displaced still fear returning place called home seeking refuge squalid camp election commission india said saturday voting would done monday polling station voting held friday order came region top election commissioner wrote agency describing mob violence gunfire damage electronic voting machine bogus voter entering booth video footage inner manipur constituency one two seat state lower house parliament showed mob raiding polling station breaking electronic voting machine another station member armed gang seen threatening voter one woman said arrived vote found vote entire family already cast one person also injured gunfire ten thousand soldier deployed prevent violence different part country voting continues till june elect country next prime minister local resident manipur said soldier tried keep order overpowered people mostly woman rushed voting booth intimidated presence armed men member opposition political group say problem confined polling place get doover calling new voting polling booth area manipur keisham meghachandra top leader opposition indian national congress manipur said member armed gang supportive incumbent government threatened candidate voter day election day polling even fired polling station mass rigging mr meghachandra said violence happened place majority voter unhappy local modi government manipur run prime minister narendra modis bharatiya janata party led nongthombam biren singh adviser mr singh state chief minister answer call sunday across india first phase voting took place friday parliamentary seat six phase still remain result announced june
nytimes,Time Is Running Out for Rahul Gandhi’s Vision for India,"April 20, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/magazine/rahul-gandhi-india-election-bjp.html,"Rahul Gandhi stood in a red Jeep, amid a churning crowd in Varanasi, trying to unseat the Indian government with a microphone in his hand. “The mic isn’t good,” he said. “Please quiet down and listen.” It was the morning of Feb. 17 — Day 35 of a journey that began in the hills of Manipur, in India’s northeast, and would end by the ocean in Mumbai, in mid-March. In total, Gandhi would cover 15 states and 4,100 miles, traveling across a country that once voted for his party, the Indian National Congress, almost by reflex. No longer, though. For a decade, the Congress Party has been so deep in the political wilderness, occupying fewer than a tenth of the seats in Parliament, that even its well-wishers wonder if Gandhi is merely the custodian of its end.  Gandhi called his expedition the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra — roughly, the Unite India March for Justice. He never said it in so many words, but the yatra was an appeal to voters to deny Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party a third straight term in parliamentary elections starting on April 19. Congress, the only other party with a national presence, is the fulcrum of an anti-B.J.P. coalition. Indian pundits and journalists bicker about many things, but on this point they’re unanimous: Only a miracle will halt the B.J.P. Still, it falls to Gandhi, steward of his enfeebled party, to try. The speech lasted barely 15 minutes. Gandhi is a fidgety orator, unable to shrug off the routine disturbances of a rally. He kept calling for silence, and scolding overzealous policemen regulating the mob. He didn’t ramble, exactly, but eddied around the point he wanted to make. “This is a country of love, not of hate,” he said. He talked of two Indias, populated respectively by the millionaires and the impoverished. He laid into TV news channels, many of which have been captured by oligarchs prospering under the B.J.P.: “They won’t show the farmers, or the workers or the poor,” he said. “But they will show Narendra Modi 24 hours a day.” Then he helped onto his Jeep a member of the audience, a young man who complained that, despite spending hundreds of thousands of rupees on his education, he still had no job. His is a common story in Modi’s India. Two out of every five recent college graduates are out of work, and young people make up 83 percent of the unemployed. To his crowd, Gandhi called out: “These are the two issues facing India: unemployment and — ?” He received only a tepid response of “poverty.” When he finished, there was no applause. The crush of people at the rally was suffocating, although in India a crowd is no index of popularity. People may gawk and then go vote for the other guy — and Gandhi is, after all, one of the country’s most recognizable men. Officially, he is no longer his party’s president, but he is undoubtedly its face. At 53, with a well-salted beard and serious eyes, he’s too old to be called Congress’s “scion,” but he still wears the sheen of dynasty. His great-grandfather, the unflinchingly secular Jawaharlal Nehru, was India’s first prime minister. His grandmother, Indira, and his father, Rajiv, both became prime ministers; both were assassinated. His mother, Sonia, steered Congress into government in 2004 and 2009, but declined the top post. Then, on the heels of several corruption scandals, the mighty party — 140 years old next year — came unstuck. Out of 543 seats in the lower house of Parliament, Congress holds just 46, compared to the B.J.P.’s 288. Gandhi embodies all this history: the triumphs as well as the failures. For the crowds, that is the fascination he exerts. One of Modi’s successes has been not just to trounce the Congress Party but also to persuade people that the party has weakened India and emasculated its Hindus. Through his cult of personality, Modi is fulfilling a century-old project, recasting India as a Hindu nation, in which minorities, particularly Muslims, live at the sufferance of the majority. Emblematic of this is a new law offering fast-tracked citizenship to people fleeing Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan — as long as they aren’t Muslim. It is the B.J.P.’s totemic achievement: the use of religion to decide who can be called “Indian.” Opposing this law or indeed resisting the B.J.P. in any way has proved difficult. Investigating agencies mount flimsy cases against critics of the government, as Amnesty International has frequently noted. (Amnesty itself halted its work in India in 2020, in the midst of what it later called an “incessant witch hunt” by the government.) Activists are regularly imprisoned, sometimes on the basis of planted evidence; journalists are sent to jail or otherwise bullied so frequently that India has slipped to 161st out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index, just three spots above Russia. Pliant courts often endorse it all. Such is the mood in India that one of the plainest sentences in Congress’s election manifesto is also one of its most resonant: “We promise you freedom from fear.” As the election neared, the quelling of dissent grew more visible still. This year, in an unprecedented move, Modi’s administration arrested two chief ministers of states run by small opposition parties. (One stepped down hours before his arrest.) In both instances, the government claimed corruption, but many critics noted that the arrests were uncannily timed to pull two popular politicians out of campaign season in states where the B.J.P. has struggled. Income-tax authorities froze Congress’s bank accounts, supposedly over a late filing. “It has been orchestrated to cripple us in the elections,” Gandhi told reporters. If so, it feels like overkill, because it is common wisdom that Congress can’t win. Those who want nothing to do with the B.J.P. watch Gandhi with conflicted anguish. He is, by all accounts, sincere, empathetic and committed to a pluralistic India. This is a man who forgave his father’s killers, and who said on the sidelines of a private New York event last year, according to one of those present: “I don’t hate Modi. The day I hate, I will leave politics.” But he’s also the latest in a lineage under whom Congress grew undemocratic and sometimes wildly corrupt. The great liberal hope is that Gandhi can achieve contradictory things: use his dynastic privilege to resuscitate his party, and dissolve the dynasty at the same time. That’s a steep demand, but Gandhi’s priorities are altogether more Himalayan. “He doesn’t say it,” Sitaram Yechury, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) who knows Gandhi well, told me, “but he’s modeling himself after Mahatma Gandhi. He doesn’t want to take any position of power.” In January, Gandhi told his colleagues that he has “one foot in and one foot out of the party,” and that he plans to be “a bridge to activists outside.” As he explained it then, the B.J.P., with its undiluted majoritarianism, “is a political-ideological machine. It can’t be defeated by a political machine alone.” His role, as he sees it, is to be the counter ideology — to go out into the country, rouse Indians to the dangers of the B.J.P. and offer them his dream of a fairer, more tolerant India instead. The yatra is a well-worn exercise in Indian politics. Its most famous practitioner, Mahatma Gandhi, returned from South Africa in 1915 hungering to know more about his country. Go travel the land, one of his mentors told him, “with eyes and ears open, but mouth shut.” After using the yatra to gain an education, he employed it for political purpose. In 1930, he walked 240 miles to the Arabian Sea to protest the British monopoly on salt; hundreds of people joined him, and he spoke to thousands en route. On reaching the beach, he scooped out a fist of salty sand and announced he had broken the monopoly, setting off a wave of civil disobedience. There have been plenty of other yatras since. In 1983, Smita Gupta, a retired journalist who was then a cub reporter, walked part of a 2,650-mile yatra by a politician named Chandra Shekhar, as he tried to enlist support against Indira Gandhi. As Gupta recalled, for people who live far from the centers of power, “when a politician descends from the skies and comes to your home, it’s a big deal — I was swept away.” Rahul Gandhi conceived of his yatra much as Chandra Shekhar did: as a way to counter the ideology of a seemingly immovable leader. There’s no place more vital for this project than Uttar Pradesh, the state through which I trailed him in February. With its 80 parliamentary seats and 240 million people, many living on incomes lower than the sub-Saharan average of $1,700 a year, Uttar Pradesh is electorally pivotal. Excelling here isn’t a guarantee of securing power in Delhi, but it’s as close to ironclad as it gets. It’s also the state that produced the Gandhis. When Nehru, born in Uttar Pradesh, ran for Parliament from a constituency near his hometown, Congress shared one advantage with other parties in post-colonial countries: the glory of having led the freedom struggle. That kept for surprisingly long without spoiling. Nehru’s heirs — Indira, then her son Rajiv, then his wife, Sonia — all won election after election from their constituencies in Uttar Pradesh. Rahul Gandhi once called Uttar Pradesh his karmabhoomi, a Sanskrit word for the land of one’s momentous actions. But Uttar Pradesh also became the land where Congress was fated to fail. Today it’s the roiling heart of the B.J.P.’s Hindu nationalism. Varanasi, Hinduism’s most sacred city, lies near the state’s eastern border, and Modi chose to represent it in Parliament — a crafty choice for a man wishing to be hailed as a defender of his faith. Around 40 million Muslims live in the state, and under its B.J.P. chief minister, they’re increasingly being erased from public life. One law jeopardizes their right to marry whom they wish. Other regulations have constricted the meat trade, in which many Muslims work. Islamic schools are in danger of being banned outright. By painting Muslims as trespassers, the B.J.P. licenses violence against them, sometimes even explicitly. (In 2015, a man was beaten to death by his Hindu neighbors in his village in western Uttar Pradesh, on the rumor that he had slaughtered a cow. The men accused of his murder have since been freed on bail and the case is still unresolved.) More than any other part of India, Uttar Pradesh shows what the B.J.P. has wrought and how successful it has been. In 2019, during the last national election, the B.J.P. swept 62 of the state’s 80 seats. Congress won just one. A few years ago, Gandhi decided that his party needed a way to mobilize people against the B.J.P., settling on a yatra as a means to that end. He embarked on his first, walking up the spine of India, in late 2022. Even the plainness of his attire — sneakers, loosefitting trousers, white polo shirt — was a rebuke to the Olympian vanity of Modi, who once had his own name stitched, in tiny letters, to form the pinstripes of a suit. The yatras felt like campaigns, yet Gandhi’s team insists that they were not about projecting him as prime minister but rather a form of ideological resistance, almost above politics. (His staff politely refused my repeated requests for an interview.) The Congress Party found itself divided over Gandhi’s approach. Salman Khurshid, a Congress veteran, worried that the party has strayed from bread-and-butter political strategy. We were in his office in Delhi, and he kept looking dolorously at his phone, which never stopped ringing. It was the feverish middle of the election season, and Congress was picking its candidates and negotiating alliances with other parties. Gandhi had to weigh in, Khurshid said: “We’d like him to be within shouting distance. He’s a thousand kilometers away.” Khurshid wished for a more customary system, the sort that promised, say, a 20-minute appointment at 10 a.m. to talk about three things. “That’s how ordinary political parties work,” he said. “He wants an extraordinary political party.” Sometimes, Gandhi’s team told Khurshid and others to come on the yatra and talk to Gandhi on the bus. But it wasn’t sufficient, Khurshid told me. “There’s never enough time.” The yatra involved a lot of stopping and starting and stopping again, as I discovered. Two or three times a day, Gandhi’s Jeep — and its caravan of police cars, S.U.V.s and a vehicle bearing a device labeled “Jammer” — inched through a town, halting at a crossroads for a speech. Then the convoy would hasten to its next engagement, trying to cover vast Uttar Pradesh distances through dense Uttar Pradesh traffic, and always behind schedule. The day ended in a cordoned-off campsite, where everyone slept in shipping containers fitted with bunks. Here, in his own enclosure, Gandhi hobnobbed with local Congress functionaries or practiced jiu-jitsu with his instructor. In Prayagraj, where we headed after Varanasi, it’s possible to traverse the distance between the party’s zenith and its rock bottom in a single evening. First, Gandhi made a speech outside Anand Bhavan, an ancestral family home, an eggshell-white mansion on an emerald lawn. Anand Bhavan is now a museum, but its chief relic is intangible: the promise of Nehruvian secularism, circa 1947. Then, while leaving Prayagraj, we passed the high court that invalidated Indira Gandhi’s election in 1975 on the grounds of electoral malpractice. The verdict provoked her to impose a state of emergency — a suspension of civic rights — for nearly two years, tarnishing Congress and strengthening its competitors. By this time too, the party had wrapped itself feudally around the dynasty. Any emergent leaders with their own base were subdued or cast off because they threatened the Gandhis. By the late 1980s, other politicians had clawed voters away from Congress by courting specific groups — members of a caste, say, or as with the B.J.P. and Hindus, of a religion. As Congress faltered, its workers joined rival parties, including the B.J.P. In India, party workers don’t just canvass voters — they step in for an insufficient state. If a farmer needing a loan is turned away by the bank manager, or if a woman can’t pay the cost of treatment for her sick daughter, party workers use their contacts to help. These services are performed in the hope that the favors will be returned every five years, come the election. “The average party worker needs, say, 10,000 rupees a month to run his home,” an old Congress hand in Varanasi, who asked not to be named for fear of professional reprisal, told me. “If their party can’t get to power, how will they get paid? They’ll go work for whoever is most likely to win.” Gilles Verniers, a political scientist, recounted taking his Ashoka University class on a trip to Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh’s capital, on the day votes were counted in a state election in 2017. He distributed his pupils among the headquarters of various parties, but by midmorning, the students at the Congress office called him. “They said: ‘Can we go elsewhere?’” Verniers told me. “ ‘There’s no one here, everybody left.’ The party knew they were getting spanked, but at least you could stick around, thanking workers, encouraging them. There was no one to even make tea.” Today, the Varanasi representative told me, “we just hope to God we win even one seat in Uttar Pradesh.” Gandhi entered politics with several lifetimes’ worth of trauma packed into his 33 years. When he was 14, two of his grandmother’s bodyguards shot her dead — revenge for an assault she ordered upon a Sikh temple to root out separatist militants sheltering within. The bodyguards had taught a young Rahul how to play badminton. Seven years later, while he was a student at Harvard, his father, Rajiv, was killed by a suicide bomber — revenge again, this time by a separatist group in Sri Lanka, where he had sent Indian troops to aid the government. It became difficult for Rahul Gandhi to be Rahul Gandhi: to trust people or go anywhere ungirded by security. For a while it didn’t seem inevitable that he would choose politics. Later he would say that he made the decision on a train just as it entered Prayagraj, when he was taking his father’s cremated remains to pour into the Ganges River. Smita Gupta, the former journalist, attended one of Gandhi’s earliest rallies, in an Uttar Pradesh town called Farrukhabad, in 2004. The road was so crowded that a 15-minute drive took three hours. Gandhi arrived in a Jeep, smiling and dimpling and waving. As he walked to the dais, the barricades broke from the masses of excited people pushing against them. “He was swept away, sailing with the crowd,” Gupta said. Soon after Congress won that election, Gandhi took charge of the party’s junior wing. The transition to the dynasty’s next generation seemed underway, and he exhibited the air of someone who knew he was the man for the job. At the time, Gandhi often showed little patience with the orthodox figures of politics. Pratap Bhanu Mehta, a political scientist at Princeton, who met Gandhi back then, recalled that he made minimal eye contact and seemed distracted — unable even to feign interest as politicians usually do so well. A journalist who met Gandhi privately told me that he was, as the saying goes, eager to tell you what you thought: “It was: ‘You don’t know how the Congress works. Let me tell you.’ Or, ‘I’ll tell you about India and Pakistan.’” In his memoir “A Promised Land,” Barack Obama compared Gandhi, whom he met in 2010, to “a student who’d done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject.” One of Gandhi’s colleagues admits he used to be “very anxious and pushy” back in the day. “He has calmed down over a period of time.” He had to. Congress isn’t a party you can change in a hurry. Its ways are too ossified, and it is honeycombed with fiefs. When Gandhi wanted Congress to field new faces in elections, he pushed for candidates to be selected through an internal voting system, rather like a primary. According to one former party consultant, senior politicians, worried about losing their tickets, complained to his mother, Sonia, the Congress president. Khurshid, one of the old guard, told me: “Everything that destroys democracy got in there — money, muscle, power.” It resulted in “the dedicated warriors of the Congress at the youth level” being sidelined. The primaries never took off. In 2018, Gandhi wanted young chief ministers in three states where Congress had won state elections. He didn’t get his way. But at least Gandhi tried something, a consultant to Congress told me. “If you leave it to these other guys,” he said, “they will not even change the curtains in the party office.” These exasperations may have amplified a hesitancy about power and responsibility that Gandhi seemed always to harbor. In 2009, he declined the offer to be a cabinet minister. Perhaps even then he saw his role as that of a moral authority outside the government, Yechury said. On becoming the party’s vice president, Gandhi gave not a stirring speech but a somber one, recalling the assassinations in his family and counseling his party that “power is poison.” In 2017, he became the party’s president, but after Congress lost the 2019 election, he quit the post. According to two Congress sources, he expected other top party leaders to feel accountable and step down as well. No one did. In a party often pilloried for being dynastic, Gandhi has been unable to stamp his will on Congress. One friend of the family described Gandhi as “timid.” When his 2022 yatra went through the state of Kerala, Yechury, the Communist leader, considered walking with him, but members of Congress’s Kerala unit protested: The Communists were their chief rivals in the state, and this show of solidarity — even against the B.J.P., a common antagonist — wouldn’t do at all. Yechury couldn’t understand it. Gandhi might not be the party’s president, but there’s no doubt he is its presiding force, Yechury said. Why didn’t he just hold fast? Two years ago, during a protest in Delhi, Gandhi and dozens of his Congress colleagues were detained by the police. One of those present, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly, told me that several senior leaders were held together, and Gandhi had “really frank and open conversations” with them. A couple of these leaders “got aggressive, saying, ‘You have to take charge,’ persuading him to take back the party presidency, accusing him of running away from responsibility.” It was high-octane drama: “What do you do when you’re detained, man? We were there for six hours. He couldn’t go anywhere.” The Congress worker remembers Gandhi saying then: “I know what I have to do. My job is to do mass outreach. You guys handle the party.” Gandhi’s two yatras have unfolded in the shadow of another, some 30 years ago — one that ultimately helped bring Modi to power. Riding in a Toyota decked out as a chariot, a B.J.P. leader named Lal Krishna Advani rode through northern and central India, advertising one of his party’s priorities: the claim that, 450 years earlier in the town Ayodhya, a Mughal ruler had knocked down a temple to build a mosque. Advani promised his audiences that the B.J.P. would restore the temple to that very spot. Two years later, the foot soldiers of the B.J.P. and other right-wing groups razed the mosque, triggering not just riots that killed 2,000 people but also a deep fracture in Indian society. After that, the B.J.P. regularly listed the construction of a temple in its election manifestos, harvesting votes out of the religious polarization around the issue. In 2019, mere months after Modi won his second term, the Supreme Court ruled that the mosque’s demolition was illegal, and that there was no evidence it had been built by knocking down a Hindu shrine. Yet the judges allowed a new temple to be erected on the site, legitimizing the majority’s abuse of disputed medieval history to its own retributive ends. In January, that temple was consecrated. Modi presided over the rites, as if he were head priest rather than prime minister. Congress didn’t send any representatives to the temple’s inauguration, and I had expected Gandhi to speak about Ayodhya, which lies, after all, in Uttar Pradesh. But he barely mentioned it, even in Varanasi, a city facing a potential reprise of Ayodhya. The morning after his speech there, I visited a quarter called Pilikothi, following a sequence of lanes, each framed by so many tall tenements that there was something canyonlike about them. It was a Sunday, but Pilikothi echoed with the tack-tack of sari looms. The sound drifted into the basement in which Abdul Batin Nomani, the mufti of Varanasi, sat at a low desk. Behind him were shelves of theological volumes. When he pulled a book out to illustrate a point, his hand didn’t hesitate for a second. The title of mufti, or jurist, has been in Nomani’s family since 1927, and he has filled the role for more than two decades. In that time, he said, the B.J.P. has spread so much hate that it has corroded even the possibility of amicable relations between Hindus and Muslims. You can be arrested for offering the namaz in public, or for being a Muslim man marrying a Hindu woman, or for running your butcher shop during Hindu festivals. You could be lynched on a whisper that you’re carrying beef, or have your house bulldozed on suspicion of being a rioter, or be hunted by mobs goaded by B.J.P. politicians calling for murder. Nomani told me about the head of a Hindu monastery nearby, and how they would invite one another to their religious functions. “Then, slowly, his mind turned,” Nomani said. “He must have been convinced that to talk to people like me is wrong.” Nomani heads the committee of the Gyanvapi Mosque, another centuries-old structure that the Hindu right aims to replace with a temple. Weeks before I met Nomani, a court allowed Hindus to worship in the mosque’s basement, similar to what happened in Ayodhya in 1986. Varanasi’s Muslims are fearful, Nomani said. Wouldn’t the same cascade of consequences ensue? Wouldn’t other mosques surely follow? When the yatra swung by, Nomani told a local Congress representative he would welcome a meeting with Gandhi. It never transpired. Nomani wondered why Gandhi didn’t even speak about the issue and directly confront the B.J.P.’s divisive politics. “Someone could have called and reassured us: ‘Don’t worry, we’re with you,’” Nomani said. He regards Gandhi with sympathy. “I believe he wants to do the right thing, and that he is against this culture of hate,” he said. “But he’s weak. His party is weak. He can’t do anything.” From Prayagraj, the yatra headed to Amethi, a town a couple of hours to the north. I had last visited in 2009, when it was still a stronghold of Congress’s first family, and I remembered the fields of winter mustard, yellow till the horizon, on the town’s outskirts and the wishbone layout of its three main roads. Gandhi won resoundingly that year. But in 2014, when his margin shrank, he must have seen the incoming tide of Hindu nationalism. Sanjay Singh, a local Congress worker, recalled that, on vote-counting day, Gandhi sounded dispirited as the results trickled in, telling his colleagues “the politics of this state is beyond my understanding.” In 2019, the B.J.P. flipped Amethi. If Gandhi hadn’t simultaneously run from another seat, in Kerala, he wouldn’t be in Parliament at all. The yatra’s schedule included an evening rally, so I spent the afternoon in Singh’s house in a village nearby. A stern-eyed man with a ramrod bearing, he wore a spotless white shirt and trousers, and he had tucked a Congress streamer around his neck like a cravat. He lamented Congress’s loss of Amethi, but he wasn’t surprised. Between 2014 and 2019, Gandhi visited Amethi less and less, dispatching his advisers instead. Still, Singh felt almost guilty that Amethi voted for the B.J.P. Last year he had a chance to meet Gandhi, he said, and asked him to run from Amethi again: “I told him, ‘Whatever mistake we made, we’re ready to rectify.’” A few weeks after I met Singh, though, Gandhi declared that he would stick to his constituency in Kerala. For the rally, the party had set up rows of chairs in a field, but the audience started dribbling out almost as soon as it began. By the time Gandhi was midway through his speech, only half the chairs were occupied. He talked about China, and riots in faraway Manipur, and the B.J.P.’s cronyism. Standing next to me, a policewoman told a videographer, “He isn’t talking about Amethi at all.” The only cheers came when he raised the plight of India’s poorer castes — the very people who made up most of his audience. As he had done throughout the yatra, he warned them they’d never get very far in the B.J.P.’s India. He may well be right, but I remembered something Mehta told me. Modi’s narrative of a resurgent Hinduism, however hollow, makes people feel good about themselves, Mehta said. “Rahul’s narrative does the opposite.” The next day, something interrupted the yatra’s staid choreography. We were in Raebareli, the one Uttar Pradesh constituency still with the Congress Party. Halfway through his address, Gandhi invited a young man onto his Jeep to quiz him about his prospects. The man introduced himself as Amit Maurya, but he was barely audible, so Gandhi said, paternally but lightly, “First, learn how to handle a microphone.” “I’m a little anxious, sir.” “Don’t worry,” Gandhi replied. “You’re a lion.” Either it was the pressure of the moment or the unchecking of a dam of frustration, but Maurya burst into tears. In the week’s most genuine moment, Gandhi seemed nonplused, as if he didn’t know what to do with this political gift. Instinctively, he folded Maurya into an embrace and kept his arm around the sobbing man. Still, he just couldn’t abandon his routine — the statistics he’d memorized, the thesis presentation mode he was in. But even if his speech didn’t change, he sounded more passionate — angry, even — about the inequities he had lined up to narrate to his crowd. Well after the yatra’s end, when summer hammers down and ballot machines appear in schools and colleges and municipal buildings, Gandhi may at least be able to count on Maurya’s vote. But who knows. Elections are subject to every manner of caprice, and the B.J.P. has shown itself to be peerless at swaying India’s voters. Out of hubris or audacity, Gandhi wants to persuade people to consider lofty things like morality and love, indispensable values that nonetheless make for nebulous campaign platforms. He doesn’t mind if it takes years, and perhaps he doesn’t mind if he loses his party in the process. In that time, though, he risks seeing his idea of India extinguished altogether.",rahul gandhi stood red jeep amid churning crowd varanasi trying unseat indian government microphone hand mic isnt good

nytimes,Why India’s Opposition Can’t Get It Together,"April 19, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/world/asia/india-election-opposition.html,"The last time Indians voted in a national election, in 2019, the Bharatiya Janata Party, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, won running away. But even then, more than 60 percent of voters cast ballots for other parties. That Mr. Modi has established such dominance in Parliament despite falling well short of majority popular support is a reflection of a dysfunctional and fractured political opposition. The main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, governed for decades after the country’s independence in 1947, guided by the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. The party’s standing is now much reduced: In 2019, it won 52 seats in Parliament to the B.J.P.’s 303. It is not expected to do much better in this year’s election, which began on Friday and runs for six weeks. Here’s why India’s political opposition is in such dire straits. The Congress, long positioned at India’s political center, has struggled to find a direction and offer an ideological alternative to the Hindu nationalist B.J.P. That has held back the broader opposition’s fight against Mr. Modi. The Congress has faced a leadership crisis, a series of rebellions and bouts of infighting. Even after two consecutive losses to Mr. Modi, the party has stuck to its dynastic leadership. It has again put forward Rahul Gandhi, the son, grandson and great-grandson of Indian prime ministers, as its face in taking on Mr. Modi. Mr. Gandhi has tried to increase his political weight by leading long marches across the country, including one of more than 2,000 miles. But when he has seemed to find momentum, the B.J.P. has moved to check it. After his first march, which drew large crowds, the B.J.P. ensnared him in a court case that led to his expulsion from Parliament. He was later returned to his seat by India’s highest court. His party’s losses in a couple of important state elections in recent months also threw it off course, laying bare the extent of its deeply entrenched problems. In the months before the election, a range of opposition parties formed an alliance catchily named INDIA, short for the less mellifluous Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance. The coalition’s creation caused unease among B.J.P. leaders, suggesting that the election could be a less one-sided affair. But a series of bitter disagreements over the sharing of seats among alliance members has disappointed many supporters. In some states, parties in the coalition failed to iron out longstanding differences, putting the protection of local turf over the national ambition of challenging Mr. Modi. One state’s chief minister, who was a founder and prominent face of the opposition bloc, even switched sides to join the B.J.P. Mr. Modi has been relentless in trying to split the coalition, luring some members with incentives and bogging down others with investigations and jail sentences. Opposition groups say Mr. Modi is having government agencies do his political work for him. They seem to have a point: Opposition leaders have been the target of about 90 percent of the cases involving politicians pursued by the country’s top financial crimes agency since Mr. Modi took power in 2014. Weeks before this year’s election, tax agencies under Mr. Modi moved to freeze the Congress’s bank accounts, leaving the party paralyzed. The Modi government has also sent two chief ministers from opposition parties to jail. While the Congress has long been the subject of Mr. Modi’s wrath — he has even declared that he wants a “Congress-free India” — a smaller outfit, the Aam Aadmi Party, or A.A.P., has faced a particularly harsh crackdown. Mr. Modi, analysts say, sees the A.A.P. as a potential national challenger as the Congress fades. The party runs the governments in the Delhi capital region and in the state of Punjab, and has made inroads in Mr. Modi’s home state of Gujarat. The opposition coalition has gone after Mr. Modi largely on two issues: the increasing authoritarianism it says is turning India’s democracy into one-party rule, and political corruption it contends is enriching a small elite. Opposition leaders have also pointed to growing inequality and India’s huge shortfall in jobs, particularly for its massive population of young people. It’s unclear whether these lines of attack have done much to dent Mr. Modi’s standing. He has amassed great power and popularity through a potent mix of Hindu majoritarianism, robust welfare programs and his own personal charisma. Mr. Modi also has enormous control over India’s channels of information, with the broadcast media particularly bent to his wishes.",last time indian voted national election bharatiya janata party led prime minister narendra modi running away even percent voter cast ballot party mr modi established dominance parliament despite falling well short majority popular support reflection dysfunctional fractured political opposition main opposition party indian national congress governed decade country independence guided nehrugandhi dynasty party standing much reduced seat parliament bjps expected much better year election began friday run six week here india political opposition dire strait congress long positioned india political center struggled find direction offer ideological alternative hindu nationalist bjp held back broader opposition fight mr modi congress faced leadership crisis series rebellion bout infighting even two consecutive loss mr modi party stuck dynastic leadership put forward rahul gandhi son grandson greatgrandson indian prime minister face taking mr modi mr gandhi tried increase political weight leading long march across country including one mile seemed find momentum bjp moved check first march drew large crowd bjp ensnared court case led expulsion parliament later returned seat india highest court party loss couple important state election recent month also threw course laying bare extent deeply entrenched problem month election range opposition party formed alliance catchily named india short le mellifluous indian national developmental inclusive alliance coalition creation caused unease among bjp leader suggesting election could le onesided affair series bitter disagreement sharing seat among alliance member disappointed many supporter state party coalition failed iron longstanding difference putting protection local turf national ambition challenging mr modi one state chief minister founder prominent face opposition bloc even switched side join bjp mr modi relentless trying split coalition luring member incentive bogging others investigation jail sentence opposition group say mr modi government agency political work seem point opposition leader target percent case involving politician pursued country top financial crime agency since mr modi took power week year election tax agency mr modi moved freeze congress bank account leaving party paralyzed modi government also sent two chief minister opposition party jail congress long subject mr modis wrath even declared want congressfree india smaller outfit aam aadmi party aap faced particularly harsh crackdown mr modi analyst say see aap potential national challenger congress fade party run government delhi capital region state punjab made inroad mr modis home state gujarat opposition coalition gone mr modi largely two issue increasing authoritarianism say turning india democracy oneparty rule political corruption contends enriching small elite opposition leader also pointed growing inequality india huge shortfall job particularly massive population young people unclear whether line attack done much dent mr modis standing amassed great power popularity potent mix hindu majoritarianism robust welfare program personal charisma mr modi also enormous control india channel information broadcast medium particularly bent wish
nytimes,"Modi’s Power Keeps Growing, and India Looks Sure to Give Him More","April 19, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/world/asia/modi-india-election.html,"As he campaigns across India for an election that began on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks of his insatiable ambitions in terms of dinner-table appetite. Roofs over heads, water connections, cooking gas cylinders — Mr. Modi reads down the menu of what he calls the abundant “development” he has provided to India’s poor. But he’s not stopping there. “What Modi has done so far is just the appetizer,” he said at one stop, referring to himself in the third person, as he often does. “The main course is yet to come.” To Mr. Modi’s legions of supporters, a third term would bring more of what they find so appealing in him. He is that rare breed of strongman who keeps an ear to the ground. He is a magnetic figure and a powerful orator. He has built an image as a tireless, incorruptible worker for a country on the rise. But to his critics, Mr. Modi’s talk of a “main course” is an alarm bell for the future of the world’s largest democracy. Mr. Modi, 73, enters the election a heavy favorite, his party’s grip over India’s more populous northern and central heartlands firmer than ever, the opposition in the same decisive geography even more diminished. Yet even with his place as India’s unrivaled leader seemingly secured, he has carried out a crackdown on dissent that has only intensified. In the lead-up to the voting, which will run for six weeks before results are announced on June 4, agencies under Mr. Modi’s control have frozen the bank accounts of the largest opposition party. The leaders of two opposition-run states have been thrown in jail, in cases they call politically motivated. (The capital region, New Delhi, is currently governed by a chief minister who sends his directives from behind bars.) All of this, Mr. Modi’s critics say, shows the penchant for full control that has become evident over his decade as prime minister. Mr. Modi, they contend, will not stop until he has turned India’s democracy into one-party rule. Power is being aggressively consolidated “around the cult of the leader’s personality,” said Yamini Aiyar, a policy analyst in New Delhi. “The deep centralization of power has significantly undermined institutional checks and balances baked into India’s democratic structure,” Ms. Aiyar said. Many Indians seem willing to accept this. Mr. Modi has remained deeply popular even as he has become more autocratic. He has paid little price — and even found support — for his effort to remake India into what analysts have called an illiberal democracy. He exploits contradictions. The right to vote is held as sacred in a country whose democracy has offered protection in a turbulent region. But polling also indicates that large numbers of Indians are willing to cede civil liberties to support a powerful ruler they see as getting things done. Another seeming incongruity: People who speak of their own economic strife also often express faith in Mr. Modi’s running of the country’s affairs, a testament to the forceful narratives he weaves. Indians have more tangible reasons to back him, too. Mr. Modi relentlessly tends his broad support base through generous offerings across society: favorable deals for the business elite in a growing economy, robust welfare programs for India’s impoverished majority, and a strong dose of Hindu nationalism for those in between. A campaign stop this month in his party’s stronghold of Uttar Pradesh illustrated this winning formula. Mr. Modi stood in the back of a saffron-colored truck as it moved slowly down a shopping street lined with global brands and jewelry shops, a scene that spoke to the new wealth that has lifted millions of Indians into the middle class. Overhead, billboards with pictures of Mr. Modi — his face is everywhere in India — told of achievements like the installation of more than 100 million toilets for the poor and India’s rising stature. At the end of the “roadshow,” at the junction where Mr. Modi’s vehicle turned right and headed back to Delhi, was a stage set up with loudspeakers. As Hindu nationalist songs blared, actors dressed up as the deities Ram and Sita posed for selfies with the crowd. Mr. Modi’s inauguration in January of a huge temple dedicated to Ram, on the disputed site of a mosque razed three decades ago by a Hindu mob, has been a major election-year offering to his Hindu base. “We are Hindu, we are Hindu, we will only speak of Ram,” went one song’s chant. “Those who brought Ram, we will bring them to power.” Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., started in 1980 as an urban middle-class organization centered around a Hindu majoritarian core. Under Mr. Modi, it has recast itself as the party of the poor and of the village in northern India, analysts say. Some in India believe that poorer people have merely fallen under Mr. Modi’s spell. Nalin Mehta, the author of the book “The New B.J.P.,” called that fundamentally wrong. “The fact that the B.J.P. continues to win these victories reflects how successful it has been in getting newer constituents of voters who never voted B.J.P. before, and who may not even be followers of Hindu nationalism,” he said. Mr. Mehta attributes much of that success to the party’s expansion and branding of welfare programs and its efforts to promote itself as pan-Hindu, actively reaching out to India’s marginalized castes. By prioritizing direct digital welfare payments, the B.J.P. has cut out the middleman and made sure the handouts are seen as coming straight from Mr. Modi. Technology also allows the party to follow up, with B.J.P. workers — armed with data — knocking on the door of anyone who received a water tap, a gas cylinder or a government grant to build a home. Data creates layers of feedback that help the party pick its candidates, jettisoning large numbers of incumbents before each election. “This B.J.P. is very ruthless on winnability,” Mr. Mehta said. Bringing it all together are Mr. Modi’s outsize appeal and his political and technological acumen. He has put his personal story at the center of his narrative of an ascendant India, the main pillar of his campaign. If a lower-caste son of a chai seller can become one of the most powerful men in the world, he says, other ordinary Indians can dream, too. While inequality has grown and 800 million Indians are at the mercy of monthly rations, many focus instead on their faith that Mr. Modi is not a thief. He casts himself as a bachelor with no descendants who works only for the Indian people, unlike what he calls the corrupt political dynasts in the opposition. “Modi wasn’t born in some royal family to become prime minister,” he told a crowd of tens of thousands in the state of Maharashtra. “It’s you who have brought him this far.” The political opposition has been severely weakened by infighting, leadership crises and its struggle to offer an ideological alternative to the B.J.P. But it also faces a playing field that Mr. Modi has tilted in his own favor. He has cowed the broadcast media. Independent journalists who do question his policies have been jailed or subjected to legal harassment. India leads the world in internet shutdowns, obscuring unrest that looks bad for the government. And officials under Mr. Modi have forced social media platforms to scrape critical content. Investigating agencies have been set loose on Mr. Modi’s political opponents — more than 90 percent of cases involving politicians over the past decade have involved the opposition. Many languish in jail or the court system. Those who switch allegiance to the B.J.P. find that their cases vanish. On the campaign trail in the state of West Bengal, an opposition candidate, Mahua Moitra, spoke of saving democracy from the authoritarianism she said had led to her own expulsion from Parliament — in a messy case involving a former romantic partner, a Rottweiler named Henry and accusations of graft. Autocracy and Mr. Modi’s perceived coziness with billionaires have been the opposition’s two main attack lines. While campaigning, Ms. Moitra told a group of women that they were still waiting for government money to build homes because Mr. Modi “is busy building palaces for his friends.” Analysts doubt that either issue will resonate widely. Many Indians, particularly in his stronghold in the north, which has a decisive say in who rules from New Delhi, like exactly what they are getting from Mr. Modi. “He is the prime minister, and if he is not strong enough, then what good would it be?” Anjali Vishwakarma, 37, an interior designer, said as she walked along the Ganges one recent day with her family in Mr. Modi’s constituency of Varanasi.",campaign across india election began friday prime minister narendra modi speaks insatiable ambition term dinnertable appetite roof head water connection cooking gas cylinder mr modi read

nytimes,Modi’s Temple of Lies,"April 18, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/opinion/india-election-modi-religion.html,"The sleepy pilgrimage city of Ayodhya in northern India was once home to a grand 16th-century mosque, until it was illegally demolished by a howling mob of Hindu militants in 1992. The site has since been reinvented as the centerpiece of the Hindu-chauvinist “new India” promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In 2020, as Covid-19 raged unchecked across the country, Mr. Modi, the leader of the Hindu right, went to Ayodhya to inaugurate construction of a three-story sandstone temple to the Hindu god Ram on the site of the former mosque. Dressed in shiny, flowing clothes and wearing a white N95 mask, he offered prayers to the Ram idol and the 88-pound silver brick being inserted as the foundation stone. I traveled to Ayodhya a year later and watched as the temple was hurriedly being built. But it seemed to me to offer not the promise of a new India so much as the seeds of its downfall. Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalism has fed distrust and hostility toward anything foreign, and the receptionists at my hotel were sullenly suspicious of outsiders. There was no hotel bar — a sign of Hindu virtue — and the food served was pure vegetarian, a phrase implying both Hindu caste purity and anti-Muslim prejudice. Outside, devotional music blared on loudspeakers while bony, manure-smeared cows, protected by Hindu law, wandered waterlogged streets in the rain. The souvenir shops at the temple displayed a toxic Hindu masculinity, highlighted by garish shirts featuring images of a steroid-fed Ram, all bulging muscles and chiseled six-packs. Even Hanuman, Ram’s wise but slightly mischievous monkey companion, appeared largely in the snarling Modi-era version known as Angry Hanuman, which went viral in 2018 after Mr. Modi praised the design. After a decade of rule by Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, Hindu-majority India maintains the facade of a democracy and has so far avoided the overt features of a theocracy. Yet, as Ayodhya revealed, it has, for all practical purposes, become a Hindu state. Adherence to this idea is demanded from everyone, whether Hindu or not. This is not sustainable, even if it seems likely that Mr. Modi will ride to a third victory in national parliamentary elections that begin Friday and conclude June 1. Mr. Modi’s India is marked by rampant inequality, lack of job prospects, abysmal public health and the increasing ravages of climate change. These crises cannot be addressed by turning one of the world’s most diverse countries into a claustrophobic Hindu nation. Perhaps even the prime minister and his party can sense this. Their crackdowns on opposition political leaders, manipulation of electoral rolls and voting machines and freezing of campaign funds for opposition parties are not the actions of a confident group. In January of this year, a wave of Hindu euphoria swept the nation as the temple I had watched being put together with cement and lies (there is no conclusive evidence supporting Hindu claims that Ram was a historical figure or that a temple to him previously stood there) was about to be inaugurated. Newspapers devoted rapturous front pages to the coming occasion, and when I flew to my former home Kolkata on the eve of the big day, my neighbors there declared their anticipation by setting off firecrackers late into the night. The next morning, on Jan. 22, loudspeakers and television screens tracked me through the city with Sanskrit chants and images of the ceremony taking place at the temple. Mr. Modi, as usual, was at the center of every visual. Friends in Delhi and Bangalore complained about insistent neighbors and strangers knocking on their doors to share celebratory sweets. Courts, banks, schools, stock markets and other establishments in much of the country took a holiday. The inauguration date seems to have been chosen carefully to overshadow Republic Day, on Jan. 26, which commemorates India’s adoption of its Constitution, amended in 1976 to affirm the country as a “socialist, secular, democratic” republic. Those values are fiercely in opposition to what Hindu nationalism has ushered in. The temple inauguration date, which will be celebrated annually, reduces the republic to secondary status next to Mr. Modi’s Hindu utopia. A similar effort has been underway to diminish the importance of Aug. 15, marking Indian independence in 1947. In 2021, Mr. Modi announced that Aug. 14 would henceforth be Partition Horrors Remembrance Day, referring to the bloody division of the country into Hindu-majority India and an independent Muslim Pakistan in 1947, a murderous affair for Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs alike. This was sold to the Indian public as underlining the need for unity, but it was also a reminder from Hindu nationalists that a section of Muslims broke off to form their own nation and that the loyalties of India’s remaining 200 million Muslims were suspect. Given that Hindu rightists participated in massacres, rapes and forced displacement during the partition, Mr. Modi’s weaponization of the suffering seems particularly reprehensible. I was born to a Hindu family, and my father, a refugee from the partition, never blamed Muslims his entire life. There have been countless other such stratagems with the Hindu right in power. The old Parliament building, whose design features refer to India’s syncretic history — Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim and Christian — was replaced last year by a new structure that explicitly reduces India’s past to a monochromatic Hindu one. In the new Parliament, the lotus flower, common in Hindu iconography and the symbol of the Bharatiya Janata Party, runs amok as a motif. A statue atop the building of four back-to-back lions — India’s national symbol and a look back at its Buddhist past — has been altered so that the lions are no longer serene and meditative, as in the original, but snarling, hypermuscular Hindu beasts. Everywhere in India, roads and cities have been renamed to sever connections to centuries of Muslim history in favor of a manufactured Hindu one. On new highways through the state of Uttar Pradesh, where I traveled last summer, gleaming signboards pointed toward concocted Hindu sites but almost never toward the state’s rich repository of Muslim mosques, forts and shrines. Knowledge and culture are being attacked along similar lines. Bollywood, Indian television and the publishing industry have become willing accomplices of Hindu chauvinists, churning out content based on Hindu mythology and revisionist history. In the news media, the few journalists and institutions unwilling to shill for the Hindu cause face legal threats and police raids. In education, government institutions are run by ignorant functionaries of the ruling party, and from school textbooks to scientific research papers, the Hindu nationalist version of India is pushed forward, myth morphing into history. In the private universities that have begun to crop up in India, Mr. Modi’s government keeps a close eye on classes, panels or research that might be construed as criticizing his government or its idea of a Hindu India. This cultural shift and the accompanying reduction of Muslims to alien intruders has been made possible by Mr. Modi delivering on his party’s three main promises to Hindu nationalists. In 2019 he repealed the notional autonomy enjoyed for decades by the disputed Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir, which the Hindu right had assailed as favoritism toward Muslims and victimization of Hindus. Later that year, Mr. Modi delivered on a second promise by introducing a law that ostensibly opened a pathway to Indian citizenship for persecuted minorities from neighboring countries but whose true motive lay in that it pointedly excluded Muslims. In the northeastern state of Assam, a registration process had already been underway to disenfranchise Muslims if they could not provide elaborate documentation of their Indian citizenship. The Bharatiya Janata Party’s declared intention to establish a similar registration system nationwide hangs the threat of disenfranchisement over all of India’s Muslims. The inauguration of the Ram temple delivered on the third and most important electoral promise. It announced, triumphantly, the climax of the battle to turn India into a Hindu nation. And yet after 10 years under Mr. Modi’s government, India is more unequal than it was under colonial British rule. In 2020 and 2021, it surpassed China as the largest source of international migrants to O.E.C.D. countries. Many of the undocumented migrants to be found pleading for entry on the U.S.-Mexico border are from India, and they include Hindus for whom India should be a utopia. The Hindu right’s near-complete control of India may indeed deliver a third term for Mr. Modi, maybe even the absolute parliamentary majority his party wants in order to expand on the transformation it has begun. But the truth is harder to hide than ever. Mr. Modi and his party are giving India the Hindu utopia they promised, and in the clear light of day, it amounts to little more than a shiny, garish temple that is a monument to majoritarian violence, surrounded by waterlogged streets, emaciated cattle and a people impoverished in every way.",sleepy pilgrimage city ayodhya northern india home grand thcentury mosque illegally demolished

nytimes,How A.I. Tools Could Change India’s Elections,"April 18, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/world/asia/india-election-ai.html,"For a glimpse of where artificial intelligence is headed in election campaigns, look to India, the world’s largest democracy, as it starts heading to the polls on Friday. An A.I.-generated version of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that has been shared on WhatsApp shows the possibilities for hyperpersonalized outreach in a country with nearly a billion voters. In the video — a demo clip whose source is unclear — Mr. Modi’s avatar addresses a series of voters directly, by name. However, it is not perfect. Mr. Modi appears to wear two different pairs of glasses, and some parts of the video are pixelated. Down the ladder, workers in Mr. Modi’s party are sending videos by WhatsApp in which their own A.I. avatars deliver personal messages to specific voters about the government benefits they have received and ask for their vote. Those video messages can be automatically generated in whichever of India’s dozens of languages the voter speaks. So can phone messages by A.I.-powered chatbots that call constituents in the voices of political leaders and seek their support. Such outreach requires a fraction of the time and money spent on traditional campaigning, and it has the potential to become an essential instrument in elections. But as the technology races onto the political scene, there are few guardrails to prevent misuse. Chatbots and personalized videos may seem more or less harmless. Experts worry, however, that voters will have an increasingly difficult time distinguishing between real and synthetic messages as the technology advances and spreads. “It’ll be the Wild West and an unregulated A.I. space this year,” said Prateek Waghre, the executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, a digital rights group based in New Delhi. The technology, he added, is entering a media landscape already polluted with misinformation. Around the world, elections have become a testing ground for the A.I. boom. The tools have been used to turn an Argentine presidential candidate into Indiana Jones and a Ghostbuster. During the New Hampshire primary, voters received robocall messages urging them not to vote, in a voice that was most likely artificially generated to sound like President Biden’s. And in India, Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., and the opposition Indian National Congress party have accused each other of spreading election-related deepfake content online. One outpost on this new Indian frontier is in the western desert state of Rajasthan. On the ground floor of a residential building on a dusty back lane, a 31-year-old college dropout, Divyendra Singh Jadoun, operates an A.I. start-up, The Indian Deepfaker. His team of nine people has been making commercials with A.I.-generated avatars of Bollywood actors and actresses. But earlier this year, political parties and politicians began asking him to do for them what he had done for celebrities. Of the 200 requests, Mr. Jadoun said, he took on 14. Among those getting the A.I. treatment is Shakti Singh Rathore, a 33-year-old B.J.P. member. His job this election season is to tell as many people as possible about Mr. Modi’s programs and policies. So he decided to create a replica of himself. “A.I. is wonderful and the way forward,” Mr. Rathore said as he settled in front of a video camera at the office of The Indian Deepfaker, preparing to become digitally incarnated. “How else could I reach the beneficiaries of Mr. Modi’s programs in such large numbers and in so short a period of time?” As Mr. Rathore adjusted a saffron scarf with the party’s logo that hung around his neck, Mr. Jadoun instructed him, “Just look into the camera and talk as if the person is sitting right in front of you.” With about five minutes’ worth of material, including an audio recording and profile shots, Mr. Jadoun went to work. He said he uses open-source A.I. systems and builds upon them with his own code. First, Mr. Rathore’s face was isolated from each frame of the recording. Then data was collected from his facial features, including the size of his face and lips, as well as his gaze. Mr. Jadoun said the data set was then fed into A.I. models that learn to predict facial patterns. “You need to keep running it through the program and fine-tuning the face until you get the best face possible,” he said. A “cloning algorithm” also analyzed the audio recording, learning the voice’s cadence and intonations. Mr. Jadoun said it often takes six to eight hours of tweaking to perfect the face and for the lips to sync with the words. The rest is largely automated. In one demo, it took about four minutes to create around 20 personalized greeting videos. Mr. Jadoun said his team could produce up to 10,000 videos a day. For larger jobs on deadline, it will rent graphics processing units. Generative A.I. can also remove language barriers, which is especially helpful in a linguistically diverse country. Mr. Rathore’s avatar can be programmed to speak regional languages to reach the remotest corners of India. Political parties are not only texting constituents video messages but also using cloned voices to call people directly, all powered by chatbots like ChatGPT. In the past, when a party representative would call voters, they would hang up, Mr. Rathore said. “But now, when a local leader utters a voter’s name, it immediately catches their attention.” During the conversation, the chatbot asks about local government programs that offer free electricity or funding for start-ups. Mr. Jadoun said the calls were recorded and transcribed for quality control and A.I. training. Mr. Rathore said he had spent around $24,000 of his own money to reach about 1.2 million people through his video messages and phone calls and to receive information about who didn’t answer. He called it an investment in his future with the B.J.P. Nikhil Pahwa, the editor of MediaNama, which covers digital media in India, said the personalized messages could be particularly powerful among Indians. “India is a country where people love to take photos with celebrity impersonators,” he said. “So if they receive a call from, say, the prime minister, and he speaks as if he knows them, where they live and what their issues are, they would actually be thrilled about it.” Mr. Waghre of the Internet Freedom Foundation questions whether A.I. content is persuasive enough to affect this year’s election. But he said the long-term effects could be problematic. “Once you normalize this in people’s information diet, what happens six months later when there are deceptive videos?” he said. Mr. Modi himself has discussed adding disclaimers to A.I.-generated content so people are not being “misguided.” Mr. Jadoun and representatives of two other A.I. start-ups in India created what they call an “A.I. coalition manifesto,” pledging to protect data privacy and uphold election integrity. For instance, Indian Deepfaker videos are labeled “A.I. generated,” and its chatbots announce that they are A.I.-generated voices, Mr. Jadoun said. Narendra Singh Bhati, 28, the owner of resorts in Rajasthan, received an A.I.-generated call from Mr. Rathore this week. Mr. Bhati said he was impressed with its personalization. He said he had not realized that the call was A.I.-generated, although the script made that clear. “I even said goodbye to Mr. Rathore” at the end, Mr. Bhati said.",glimpse artificial intelligence

nytimes,Man Accused in Plot to Assassinate Sikh Separatist Pleads Not Guilty,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/nyregion/nikhil-gupta-india-assassination-plot.html,"An Indian man pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of orchestrating a failed assassination plot against a Sikh separatist in New York, a plan that prosecutors say he devised on behalf of an unnamed official in India’s government. The defendant, Nikhil Gupta, 52, was arrested in the Czech Republic a year ago, and was extradited last week to make his first appearance in Manhattan federal court. He is accused of trying to arrange the murder of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American citizen and lawyer for a New York-based Sikh secessionist group. The murder attempt, which played out against a backdrop of doubt about India’s commitment to democracy, spanned several countries and mirrored the successful killing of another separatist in Canada, prosecutors say. On Monday morning, Mr. Gupta entered the Lower Manhattan courtroom in a blue cardigan and yellow patterned shirt and appeared relaxed as he spoke to his lawyer, Jeffrey Chabrowe, at the defense table. He has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since landing in the United States on Friday afternoon. In a statement to reporters after the arraignment, Mr. Chabrowe called the case a “complex matter"" for India and the United States. “Background and details will develop that may cast government allegations into an entirely new light,” he said. Mr. Gupta is charged with murder for hire and conspiracy to commit murder for hire. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison for each charge. He was sent back to the detention center after Monday’s arraignment and is set to appear in court again on June 28. In a statement Monday, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said Mr. Gupta will “now face justice” in an American courtroom. “This extradition makes clear that the Justice Department will not tolerate attempts to silence or harm American citizens,” he said. In an indictment unsealed in November, Manhattan federal prosecutors described an audacious plot that began around May 2023 when an Indian government employee enlisted Mr. Gupta to organize the killing of Mr. Pannun, who was living in New York at the time. Mr. Pannun is the general counsel of Sikhs for Justice, an organization that supports the secession of Punjab, a state in northern India. He is a vocal critic of the Indian government and has been banned from the country, prosecutors say. Mr. Gupta, who lived in India, had told the government official about “his involvement in international narcotics and weapons trafficking,” according to the indictment. At the direction of the Indian government employee, Mr. Gupta contacted a man who he believed would help him hire a hit man in New York, but who was, in fact, an agent for the American government. That agent introduced Mr. Gupta to an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration officer who pretended to be the hit man. In deals brokered by Mr. Gupta, the Indian government official agreed to pay the D.E.A. officer $100,000 to kill Mr. Pannun, including a $15,000 cash advance for the job, prosecutors said. Mr. Gupta then shared personal information about Mr. Pannun with the undercover officer, including Mr. Pannun’s address in New York and his phone number. When the Indian official asked for updates, Mr. Gupta relayed surveillance photos of Mr. Pannun that the agent had sent him. Mr. Gupta instructed the undercover officer to carry out the assassination as soon as possible, but asked him not to do it around the time of high-level meetings between U.S. and Indian officials, according to the indictment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington and met with President Biden in June 2023. Then, prosecutors said, on June 18 of that year, gunmen killed Hardeep Singh Nijjar, another Sikh separatist leader, in British Columbia, Canada. Mr. Nijjar knew Mr. Pannun and was also an outspoken critic of the Indian government. Soon after, prosecutors said, Mr. Gupta told the undercover officer that Mr. Nijjar “was also the target” and that “we have so many targets.” Mr. Gupta then told the officer — the pretend hit man — that there was “now no need to wait” to kill Mr. Pannun, prosecutors said. On Monday, Mr. Pannun said in a statement that he had “full faith” that the United States would hold Mr. Gupta and his co-conspirators accountable. “The attempt on my life on American soil is the blatant case of India’s transnational terrorism challenging America’s sovereignty and unequivocally proves that Modi’s India believes in using violence to suppress the dissenting political opinion,” he said. A spokesman for the Indian Embassy in Washington, D.C., could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. Mr. Gupta’s case has threatened to complicate the delicate relations among Washington, Ottawa and New Delhi. During his presidency, Mr. Biden has courted India’s leaders to counter the influence of Russia and China, despite growing concerns about India’s commitment to democracy. Mr. Modi, who has been in office since 2014, was re-elected as India’s prime minister in June, even as his Bharatiya Janata Party lost its majority in Parliament.",indian man pleaded guilty monday charge orchestrating failed assassination plot sikh separatist new york plan prosecutor say devised behalf unnamed official india government defendant nikhil gupta arrested czech republic year ago extradited last week make first appearance manhattan federal court accused trying arrange murder gurpatwant singh pannun american citizen lawyer new yorkbased sikh secessionist group murder attempt played backdrop doubt india commitment democracy spanned several country mirrored successful killing another separatist canada prosecutor say monday morning mr gupta entered lower manhattan courtroom blue cardigan yellow patterned shirt appeared relaxed spoke lawyer jeffrey chabrowe defense table held metropolitan detention center brooklyn since landing united state friday afternoon statement reporter arraignment mr chabrowe called case complex matter india united state background detail develop may cast government allegation entirely new light said mr gupta charged murder hire conspiracy commit murder hire convicted would face maximum year prison charge sent back detention center monday arraignment set appear court june statement monday attorney general merrick b garland said mr gupta face justice american courtroom extradition make clear justice department tolerate attempt silence harm american citizen said indictment unsealed november manhattan federal prosecutor described audacious plot began around may indian government employee enlisted mr gupta organize killing mr pannun living new york time mr pannun general counsel sikh justice organization support secession punjab state northern india vocal critic indian government banned country prosecutor say mr gupta lived india told government official involvement international narcotic weapon trafficking according indictment direction indian government employee mr gupta contacted man believed would help hire hit man new york fact agent american government agent introduced mr gupta undercover drug enforcement administration officer pretended hit man deal brokered mr gupta indian government official agreed pay dea officer kill mr pannun including cash advance job prosecutor said mr gupta shared personal information mr pannun undercover officer including mr pannuns address new york phone number indian official asked update mr gupta relayed surveillance photo mr pannun agent sent mr gupta instructed undercover officer carry assassination soon possible asked around time highlevel meeting u indian official according indictment prime minister narendra modi visited washington met president biden june prosecutor said june year gunman killed hardeep singh nijjar another sikh separatist leader british columbia canada mr nijjar knew mr pannun also outspoken critic indian government soon prosecutor said mr gupta told undercover officer mr nijjar also target many target mr gupta told officer pretend hit man need wait kill mr pannun prosecutor said monday mr pannun said statement full faith united state would hold mr gupta coconspirator accountable attempt life american soil blatant case india transnational terrorism challenging america sovereignty unequivocally prof modis india belief using violence suppress dissenting political opinion said spokesman indian embassy washington dc could immediately reached comment monday mr guptas case threatened complicate delicate relation among washington ottawa new delhi presidency mr biden courted india leader counter influence russia china despite growing concern india commitment democracy mr modi office since reelected india prime minister june even bharatiya janata party lost majority parliament
nytimes,Train Crash in India Leaves at Least 8 Dead and Dozens Injured,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/world/asia/india-train-crash.html,"A freight train collided with a passenger train in eastern India on Monday, killing at least eight people and injuring 50 others, officials said. The episode occurred at around 9 a.m. when the Kanchanjunga Express, which was carrying passengers to the state of West Bengal from the state of Tripura, was leaving the Rangapani station. Four coaches of the popular and often-crowded passenger train derailed when it was rammed from behind by the commercial train. Images from the accident site showed one of the passenger coaches lifted off the railway track and balancing on a coach of the freight train. The death toll was likely to rise. Local news outlets, citing police officials, reported at least 15 people dead. The driver and the assistant driver of the freight train and a guard on the passenger train were among those killed. Jaya Varma Sinha, the chairperson of India’s railway board, said rescue operations were completed. Ashwini Vaishnaw, India’s railway minister, was en route to the site. The relatively low number of casualties could be attributed to the fact that the rear portion of the Kanchanjunga Express, which took the biggest impact from the collision, comprised cargo coaches and the guard’s coach. Passengers were in compartments far forward from the impact. While an investigation has been ordered to look into the cause of the collision, Ms. Sinha said human error such as disregarding a railway signal could have caused the crash. The accident again brings to the fore the issue of rail safety in a country whose millions of poor residents rely on railways for transport. India’s rail network is one of the world’s largest and is crucial to the country’s economy and its people’s lives and livelihood. The country has, in recent years, invested heavily on rail safety after a long history of deadly accidents. Although the overall number of rail accidents has lessened over the past decade, incidents with mass casualties have persisted. Last June, 290 people were killed when two passenger trains collided after one of them struck a stationary freight train at full speed and derailed in the state of Odisha. After that incident, opposition leaders demanded the resignation of Mr. Vaishnaw, the railway minister. He has said he was trying to expand a safety system, called Kavach, that is meant to prevent accidents when two trains are moving on the same track. Ms. Sinha said the technology had not yet been deployed on the route of the Kanchanjunga Express.",freight train collided passenger train eastern india monday killing least eight people injuring others official said episode occurred around kanchanjunga express carrying passenger state west bengal state tripura leaving rangapani station four coach popular oftencrowded passenger train derailed rammed behind commercial train image accident site showed one passenger coach lifted railway track balancing coach freight train death toll likely rise local news outlet citing police official reported least people dead driver assistant driver freight train guard passenger train among killed jaya varma sinha chairperson india railway board said rescue operation completed ashwini vaishnaw india railway minister en route site relatively low number casualty could attributed fact rear portion kanchanjunga express took biggest impact collision comprised cargo coach guard coach passenger compartment far forward impact investigation ordered look cause collision m sinha said human error disregarding railway signal could caused crash accident brings fore issue rail safety country whose million poor resident rely railway transport india rail network one world largest crucial country economy people life livelihood country recent year invested heavily rail safety long history deadly accident although overall number rail accident lessened past decade incident mass casualty persisted last june people killed two passenger train collided one struck stationary freight train full speed derailed state odisha incident opposition leader demanded resignation mr vaishnaw railway minister said trying expand safety system called kavach meant prevent accident two train moving track m sinha said technology yet deployed route kanchanjunga express

While diplomats from the Group of 7 hammered out a communiqué that pledged support for Ukraine in its war against Russia and greater ambition in curbing carbon emissions, the focus was on Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and other leaders from outside the G7, whose support is increasingly critical to achieving any of these goals. Among the thorny questions on the second day of the summit: migration, which has helped fuel a recent resurgence of populism and far-right parties in Europe and the United States. The leaders also discussed the war in Gaza and China’s state subsidies of industries like electric vehicles, which has prompted the United States and the European Union to impose tariffs on Chinese exports. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, who is hosting the gathering, said the goal of her expanded guest list was to “strengthen dialogue with the nations of the Global South.” She insisted that the Group of 7 was “not a fortress closed in itself” but “an offer of values that we open to the world.” Ms. Meloni recruited Pope Francis to speak to the leaders about the dangers posed by artificial intelligence. Francis urged them to regulate the technology, of which he was himself a victim when A.I.-generated fake images of him clad in a white puffer jacket and a jewel-encrusted crucifix went viral last year. “The benefits and the damages it causes will depend on the way it is used,” the pope declared, warning of the risks of A.I.’s uncontrolled development. He called for lethal autonomous weapons, which are unmanned and uncontrolled by a human hand, to be banned, saying, “No machine should ever decide whether to take the life of a human being away.”",group country threw open door club friday india brazil turkey nonwestern country acknowledging shifting global landscape tried enlist nation leader cause ranging climate change managing economic competition china diplomat group hammered communiqu pledged support ukraine war russia greater ambition curbing carbon emission focus prime minister narendra modi india president luiz incio lula da silva brazil leader outside g whose support increasingly critical achieving goal among thorny question second day summit migration helped fuel recent resurgence populism farright party europe united state leader also discussed war gaza china state subsidy industry like electric vehicle prompted united state european union impose tariff chinese export prime minister giorgia meloni italy hosting gathering said goal expanded guest list strengthen dialogue nation global south insisted group fortress closed offer value open world m meloni recruited pope francis speak leader danger posed artificial intelligence francis urged regulate technology victim aigenerated fake image clad white puffer jacket jewelencrusted crucifix went viral last year benefit damage cause depend way used pope declared warning risk ai uncontrolled development called lethal autonomous weapon unmanned uncontrolled human hand banned saying machine ever decide whether take life human away
nytimes,Fire in Kuwait Worker Housing Leaves at Least 49 Dead,"June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/world/middleeast/fire-kuwait-migrant-worker-housing.html,"At least 49 people were killed and dozens of others injured in the Persian Gulf country of Kuwait, the state news agency said, when a fire broke out on Wednesday in a building that housed scores of low-income workers, many of them Indian nationals. The fire began during the morning in a coastal area called Mangaf, about half an hour’s drive from the center of the capital, Kuwait City. The Kuwaiti authorities have held the building owner for questioning as they investigate the cause of the fire and try to determine whether “any shortcoming or neglect” played a role, the state news agency reported. The authorities promised to begin a campaign to tackle building code violations. The public prosecutor’s office also planned to inspect the site and interview survivors. Speaking to journalists at the site of the fire, Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Al Sabah — Kuwait’s deputy prime minister and interior minister — blamed “the greed of property owners” for the disaster and said that the owner of the company employing the workers would also be detained, the Reuters news agency and Kuwaiti newspapers reported. Jayashankar, an Indian salesman who survived the fire, said that he awoke to screams around 4 a.m. local time. He and his roommates opened the door to their fourth-floor apartment and found that thick black smoke had enveloped the corridor, burning their lungs, he said in a phone interview, asking to be identified by his first name only for fear of retribution. Instead of trying to escape, he said, they locked the door, opened a window and waited for help. Two of his roommates who left the apartment to find an exit later died, he said. Witnesses told local news outlets that the fire had begun at the bottom of the seven-story building, sending smoke billowing upward. In a televised interview, an official in Kuwait’s firefighting force, Col. Sayed Hassan Al-Moussawi, said, “In a building like this, you’re supposed to go up to the roof, but unfortunately the door to the roof was locked.” Ramesh, an Indian worker who lives in a building next door and who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said in an interview that he saw people trying to jump out of windows to escape. The fire’s high death toll highlighted the perils faced by low-income immigrants to Gulf countries, who often toil under exploitative contracts and live in overcrowded housing, with regulatory protections that are limited or poorly enforced. Foreigners make up about two-thirds of the population of Kuwait, an oil-rich nation with one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds. Many are low-paid workers from South Asian countries who perform jobs including construction, restaurant service and street cleaning. More than 50 people hurt during the fire were sent to hospitals around Kuwait, with injuries including burns, broken bones from jumping out of the building and carbon monoxide poisoning from smoke inhalation, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. Nine were in critical condition, it said. Many of the workers affected were from India, the country’s embassy in Kuwait said on social media. On Wednesday, India’s ambassador to Kuwait, Adarsh Swaika, visited several hospitals where workers were taken, the embassy said in its posts. In a post on X, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India said that the fire was “saddening” and that the Indian Embassy would monitor the situation closely and work with the authorities “to assist the affected.” In a video published by the Kuwaiti news media, Sheikh Fahad was shown at the location of the fire, questioning an unidentified man about who lived in the building. The man told him that 196 people had lived there. The video cut off after Sheikh Fahad told the authorities to detain the man for questioning. Officials working in the municipality overseeing the area were also suspended from work pending an investigation, Kuwait’s state news agency reported. Building codes in Gulf countries are often laxly put in place, and smoke detectors and fire escapes are not common in residential properties. At the site of the fire on Wednesday afternoon, municipal employees were already putting up notices of violations on nearby buildings, including for partitioning rooms with gypsum board. Mangaf is predominantly inhabited by migrant workers, with apartment blocks housing men from India, Bangladesh and Egypt. Interviewed by The New York Times near the fire location, workers who lived nearby gave varying accounts of the numbers of men typically housed in each room, ranging from three to 12. Jayashankar, the survivor, said that nine people, all Indians, had shared his three-bedroom apartment. The building bore a sign saying it was a workers’ camp for a company called NBTC Group, a contracting firm headquartered in Kuwait with business in construction, industry, logistics and related fields. Phone calls to the company on Wednesday went unanswered, and an employee at the company’s offices said that staff members had been detained by officials that day. Another Indian worker who lived on the second floor of the building said that he and his roommates had survived because they had been out working an overnight shift. The worker, Sami, 45, who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said he had not yet been able to go inside to retrieve his belongings and inspect the damage because the police had closed off entrances to the building. Shahrukh Kha, who is from Bihar, India, said that he had spent all day trying to reach his brother, Kalu, who lived in the building, but that his brother’s phone was off. “We have not gotten any kind of information about whether he is injured or dead,” he said in a phone interview. Kalu Kha, a 30-year-old salesman who works in a fruit and vegetable shop, had been planning to travel home to India next month, his brother said; his wedding date is set for July 22.",least people killed dozen others injured persian gulf country kuwait state news agency said fire broke wednesday building housed score lowincome worker many indian national fire began morning coastal area called mangaf half hour drive center capital kuwait city kuwaiti authority held building owner questioning investigate cause fire try determine whether shortcoming neglect played role state news agency reported authority promised begin campaign tackle building code violation public prosecutor office also planned inspect site interview survivor speaking journalist site fire sheikh fahad yusuf al sabah kuwait deputy prime minister interior minister blamed greed property owner disaster said owner company employing worker would also detained reuters news agency kuwaiti newspaper reported jayashankar indian salesman survived fire said awoke scream around local time roommate opened door fourthfloor apartment found thick black smoke enveloped corridor burning lung said phone interview asking identified first name fear retribution instead trying escape said locked door opened window waited help two roommate left apartment find exit later died said witness told local news outlet fire begun bottom sevenstory building sending smoke billowing upward televised interview official kuwait firefighting force col sayed hassan almoussawi said building like youre supposed go roof unfortunately door roof locked ramesh indian worker life building next door also asked identified first name fear retribution said interview saw people trying jump window escape fire high death toll highlighted peril faced lowincome immigrant gulf country often toil exploitative contract live overcrowded housing regulatory protection limited poorly enforced foreigner make twothirds population kuwait oilrich nation one world largest sovereign wealth fund many lowpaid worker south asian country perform job including construction restaurant service street cleaning people hurt fire sent hospital around kuwait injury including burn broken bone jumping building carbon monoxide poisoning smoke inhalation ministry health said statement nine critical condition said many worker affected india country embassy kuwait said social medium wednesday india ambassador kuwait adarsh swaika visited several hospital worker taken embassy said post post x prime minister narendra modi india said fire saddening indian embassy would monitor situation closely work authority assist affected video published kuwaiti news medium sheikh fahad shown location fire questioning unidentified man lived building man told people lived video cut sheikh fahad told authority detain man questioning official working municipality overseeing area also suspended work pending investigation kuwait state news agency reported building code gulf country often laxly put place smoke detector fire escape common residential property site fire wednesday afternoon municipal employee already putting notice violation nearby building including partitioning room gypsum board mangaf predominantly inhabited migrant worker apartment block housing men india bangladesh egypt interviewed new york time near fire location worker lived nearby gave varying account number men typically housed room ranging three jayashankar survivor said nine people indian shared threebedroom apartment building bore sign saying worker camp company called nbtc group contracting firm headquartered kuwait business construction industry logistics related field phone call company wednesday went unanswered employee company office said staff member detained official day another indian worker lived second floor building said roommate survived working overnight shift worker sami also asked identified first name fear retribution said yet able go inside retrieve belonging inspect damage police closed entrance building shahrukh kha bihar india said spent day trying reach brother kalu lived building brother phone gotten kind information whether injured dead said phone interview kalu kha yearold salesman work fruit vegetable shop planning travel home india next month brother said wedding date set july
nytimes,"At the Ambani Wedding Celebrations, a Dazzling Display of Jewels","June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/fashion/weddings/ambani-jewels.html,"When Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India abruptly changed her country’s constitution in 1971 and abolished the Privy Purse, a government allowance for the country’s former princely rulers, she also moved to nationalize their storied treasuries. Among the maharajahs, nizams and nabobs that once ruled the subcontinent, this set off a frenzy as they scurried to bury the family jewels. For centuries, the rarity, scale and grandeur of Indian jewels was so great that many became iconic objects. Take the Patiala Necklace, a tiered ornament resembling draperies of gems. Designed by Cartier, it featured an astounding 2,930 diamonds and centered on a single rock the size of a walnut. Or consider the Indore Pears, two stupendous and closely matched diamonds owned by Maharajah Yeshwant Rao Holkar II, a glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom was in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Indian princely patronage long set a global standard of splendor for both artistry and ostentation in the jewel trade. Yet in the decades after the Privy Purse, most of the big rocks seemed to have vanished underground. Legend has it that members of formerly royal families stashed their jewels in Swiss vaults, pawned them on the black market or hid them in flower pots. Bling on a royal scale largely disappeared. Or so it seemed until a fresh cadre of princes heaved into view: oligarchs. The richest of these by orders of magnitude is Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of his family’s megacompany Reliance Industries. Mr. Ambani’s personal fortune is estimated by Forbes at a staggering $115 billion. Despite his vast wealth, few outside India had heard of him — that is, until March 1, when he hosted a three-day party to celebrate his son Anant’s wedding in July. Everything about the prewedding affair was on a princely scale: the guest list of 1,000, including boldface names like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump; a glass palace specially constructed in the Ambani’s hometown, Jamnagar, in the western state of Gujarat; and Rihanna’s first public performance in years. Rihanna’s reported $6 million payday hogged the headlines, but what lit up at least one obsessive corner of the internet was the Ambani jewelry. This included necklaces and earrings and rings and hair ornaments of a size and grandeur seldom seen publicly since the days of the Raj. “It was almost like the time of maharajahs 100 years down the line,” said Pramod Kumar, an archivist and a founder of the museum consultancy EKA. He is also keeper of topophilia.india, an erudite Instagram account that is catnip for Indophile aesthetes. Mr. Kumar’s sleuth work traced a possible source of the two most gobsmacking gems seen at the Ambani prewedding celebration: massive step-cut Colombian emeralds roughly the size of Popsicles. Draped one below the other as pendants to a diamond necklace, they were worn one evening by the bridegroom’s mother, Nita Ambani. The bigger one was “of 562 carats,” Mr. Kumar wrote in an Instagram post, adding that the weight of the smaller stone was a mere 303 carats. Whatever their source, those emeralds were just two among many gems on display throughout an event at which the jewels often had greater star power than their wearers. “That emerald necklace was what caught everyone’s attention at first, but it was all almost unfathomable,” said Stellene Volandes, the editor in chief of Town & Country. She noted the scarcity represented by ropes of the rarest natural pearls from the Arabian Sea; necklaces in the heavy, ornate rani haar style studded with diamonds; and headpieces known as maang tikka, made with deep green emeralds from the storied Muzo mines. “You’d be very hard-pressed to find comparables for the sheer size and horsepower” of the jewels at the Ambani prewedding party, said Nico Landrigan, the president of the Verdura jewelry house in New York. “The Indians are a jewelry-obsessed culture in a category all their own. So you can only imagine what the actual wedding will bring out.” Before the wedding, scheduled for July 12 to 14 in Mumbai, there was yet another lavish preparatory celebration and opportunity to flaunt big rocks — a cruise from the Tyrrhenian Sea in Palermo, Italy, to the Mediterranean in Cannes, France, on an ocean liner whose 2,400 staterooms had been retrofitted for the Ambanis as three-bedroom suites for 800 invited guests. “Basically, what the Ambanis are doing is displaying a kind of old-style Hollywood glam,” said Mr. Kumar of EKA. “You don’t see that with any other current billionaire moguls in Europe or America, at least not in the public realm.” For Daniela Mascetti, the former chairwoman of Sotheby’s jewelry division in Europe and an author of “Understanding Jewelry,” a bible of the trade, the group more aptly compared to the Ambanis is the robber barons of the Industrial Age. “You have to look back to Vanderbilt or Gould, who also wanted big door-stoppers,” Ms. Mascetti said from London. “Let’s put it in a nice way,” she added. “If you are new money and you want to display wealth, you go big.” Yet it is not altogether that simple. Certain Ambani jewels were crafted using the whopper stones, but that is not to suggest that the determining factor in commissioning them was size. “There is tremendous artistry in the work,” said Ms. Volandes of Town & Country. Much of the Ambani jewels were designed by Viren Bhagat, among the more refined high jewelers, though also an assiduously private one. More than the size of individual stones like the stepped-cut emeralds, few save a detective like Mr. Kumar could predict their origins. “Being one-off is of the greatest importance in that world,” Francesca Amfitheatrof, the creative director of high jewelry and watches at Louis Vuitton, said recently from St.-Tropez, France, where she was debuting her latest collection. “To be able to source things that are so unique and outstanding, honestly, only an emperor has that possibility anymore,” she said. “It’s completely maharajah-like. It’s imperial.”",prime minister indira gandhi india abruptly changed country constitution abolished privy purse government allowance country former princely ruler also moved nationalize storied treasury among maharajah nizams nabob ruled subcontinent set frenzy scurried bury family jewel century rarity scale grandeur indian jewel great many became iconic object take patiala necklace tiered ornament resembling drapery gem designed cartier featured astounding diamond centered single rock size walnut consider indore pear two stupendous closely matched diamond owned maharajah yeshwant rao holkar ii glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom central indian state madhya pradesh indian princely patronage long set global standard splendor artistry ostentation jewel trade yet decade privy purse big rock seemed vanished underground legend member formerly royal family stashed jewel swiss vault pawned black market hid flower pot bling royal scale largely disappeared seemed fresh cadre prince heaved view oligarch richest order magnitude mukesh ambani chairman family megacompany reliance industry mr ambanis personal fortune estimated forbes staggering billion despite vast wealth outside india heard march hosted threeday party celebrate son anants wedding july everything prewedding affair princely scale guest list including boldface name like mark zuckerberg bill gate ivanka trump glass palace specially constructed ambanis hometown jamnagar western state gujarat rihannas first public performance year rihannas reported million payday hogged headline lit least one obsessive corner internet ambani jewelry included necklace earring ring hair ornament size grandeur seldom seen publicly since day raj almost like time maharajah year line said pramod kumar archivist founder museum consultancy eka also keeper topophiliaindia erudite instagram account catnip indophile aesthete mr kumars sleuth work traced possible source two gobsmacking gem seen ambani prewedding celebration massive stepcut colombian emerald roughly size popsicle draped one pendant diamond necklace worn one evening bridegroom mother nita ambani bigger one carat mr kumar wrote instagram post adding weight smaller stone mere carat whatever source emerald two among many gem display throughout event jewel often greater star power wearer emerald necklace caught everyones attention first almost unfathomable said stellene volandes editor chief town country noted scarcity represented rope rarest natural pearl arabian sea necklace heavy ornate rani haar style studded diamond headpiece known maang tikka made deep green emerald storied muzo mine youd hardpressed find comparables sheer size horsepower jewel ambani prewedding party said nico landrigan president verdura jewelry house new york indian jewelryobsessed culture category imagine actual wedding bring wedding scheduled july mumbai yet another lavish preparatory celebration opportunity flaunt big rock cruise tyrrhenian sea palermo italy mediterranean cannes france ocean liner whose stateroom retrofitted ambanis threebedroom suite invited guest basically ambanis displaying kind oldstyle hollywood glam said mr kumar eka dont see current billionaire mogul europe america least public realm daniela mascetti former chairwoman sothebys jewelry division europe author understanding jewelry bible trade group aptly compared ambanis robber baron industrial age look back vanderbilt gould also wanted big doorstopper m mascetti said london let put nice way added new money want display wealth go big yet altogether simple certain ambani jewel crafted using whopper stone suggest determining factor commissioning size tremendous artistry work said m volandes town country much ambani jewel designed viren bhagat among refined high jeweler though also assiduously private one size individual stone like steppedcut emerald save detective like mr kumar could predict origin oneoff greatest importance world francesca amfitheatrof creative director high jewelry watch louis vuitton said recently sttropez france debuting latest collection able source thing unique outstanding honestly emperor possibility anymore said completely maharajahlike imperial

On Sunday, that space was transformed into a stage for one of the most-watched global sporting events of the year. More than 34,000 fans and cricket dignitaries squeezed into a temporary stadium built in the last three months in the Long Island park to watch the most anticipated match of the T20 Cricket World Cup: India versus Pakistan. For about three hours, fans in blue and orange India shirts mingled with their (vastly outnumbered) rivals in the dark green of Pakistan, producing a festive and vibrant atmosphere. They roared at every big play, shouting and waving signs and flags. They ate South Asian food sold at the concession stands, jumped, chanted, high-fived with fellow supporters and — after a bit of rain — soaked up the sunshine on a historic day at the usually quiet park. “It was electric,” said Chandu Talla, an India fan and entrepreneur from Tampa, Fla., who came to the match with his son Aryan, a high school junior. “We paid $2,500 per ticket and no regrets,” he added. “It was a dream come true to see India here.” After a slow start, India came back strong to win, and when Pakistan’s Naseem Shah hit the last ball from India bowler Arshdeep Singh, the India fans erupted in cheers. “It was pretty good,” said India bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who was named the player of the match. “Always, when India and Pakistan play, a lot of emotion does come in. It did feel like we had a lot of support.” People in the New York area may have been mostly oblivious to it, but any match between India and Pakistan, two of the greatest cricketing nations, is a monumental event, at least in South Asia and other cricket-loving parts of the world. The previous time the teams played, last fall, viewership reached 398 million in India alone, according to the International Cricket Council. (This year’s Super Bowl had 123 million viewers.) Sunday’s attendance (34,028) constituted the largest at an international cricket match in the United States, according to the I.C.C. Attendees included such cricketing legends as Yuvraj Singh of India, Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi and Australia’s Ricky Ponting. For Omar Minaya, the Yankees’ special adviser and the former general manager of the Mets, the cricket match was his first. “It’s amazing,” he said. “The atmosphere is great. It’s like the World Baseball Classic, or the Dominican Baseball League.” The T20 World Cup, held every two years, is a 20-nation tournament featuring a shorter form of cricket. This year, for the first time, the event is being held in the United States and several Caribbean nations where cricket is revered. The U.S. matches are also being held in Dallas and Lauderhill, Fla., but New York was designated for the marquee matchup. Cricket is part of the cultural fabric in both India and Pakistan, but political tensions over the decades have forced the countries to play each other in other places. “Oh, it’s contentious, a real battle of sentiments,” said Narinder Kapoor, 84, a retired U.S. Treasury Department agent, originally from New Delhi. “When these countries play, it’s a real hot potato.” A former amateur cricket player who emigrated to Syosset, N.Y., in 1972, Mr. Kapoor had not seen a cricket match live since 1974, although he watches the sport constantly on TV. He went to the game between Ireland and Canada on Friday and had hoped to attend Sunday’s big encounter, but his knees were ailing him, so he stayed home, according to his son, Sandeep Kapoor. The elder Mr. Kapoor said that he enjoyed the sparsely attended match on Friday, but added that the temporary stadium did not have enough accommodations for people with disabilities and that it was difficult for older people to ascend the steps. “But once you are inside, the field and the view is excellent,” he said. “World class.” Security was tight for the match, especially after a website purportedly affiliated with the terrorist organization ISIS called for attacks on the event. Mounted police, SWAT units, sniffer dogs, helicopters and large numbers of police officers swarmed the area, and long lines formed at entrances as people went through security scanners. Bruce Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, said that the I.C.C. had defrayed some of the cost of the security, which he said included local, state and federal agencies, including the F.B.I. “I want to commend the fans,” Mr. Blakeman said, adding, “Everybody has been so polite and respectful, and they followed instructions so they could be safe and healthy.” There was at least one exception. An airplane trailing a sign that said “Release Imran Khan” breached restricted airspace over the stadium before the match. (Mr. Khan, a former Pakistani cricket star and former prime minister of Pakistan, is serving a prison sentence there.) Mr. Blakeman said the plane was eventually intercepted. The mood at the park was generally upbeat, even for Pakistan fans on the losing end. “India-Pakistan is a very big deal,” said Temu Martin, an airfreight transport official from New Jersey and a Pakistan supporter. “But it’s not war. It’s a game.” He said that after Pakistan lost to the United States last week in a major upset in Dallas, ticket prices for Sunday’s match in East Meadow plummeted from over $2,000 to $600. He said he was planning to travel to Barbados for Pakistan’s next match and then to attend a knockout-stage match in Antigua. There are three more matches scheduled in New York, with the final one on Wednesday between India and the United States. The stadium will then be dismantled and the pieces sent out to other sporting events around the country. Mr. Blakeman predicted that Nassau County would make $150 million on the eight New York games of the tournament — 10 times what the county spent on infrastructure, planning and security, he said. Cricket officials had told him that there could be as many as 600 million viewers worldwide for Sunday’s match, he added. He said that he had heard from investors who want to bring the sport, perhaps with New York’s franchise in Major League Cricket, to Nassau County. “The way things have gone here these last couple of weeks, I think cricket has found a home,” Mr. Blakeman said.",normally time year grassy southeastern corner eisenhower park east meadow ny place softball game family picnic cricket player enjoying warm weekend afternoon sunday space transformed stage one mostwatched global sporting event year fan cricket dignitary squeezed temporary stadium built last three month long island park watch anticipated match cricket world cup india versus pakistan three hour fan blue orange india shirt mingled vastly outnumbered rival dark green pakistan producing festive vibrant atmosphere roared every big play shouting waving sign flag ate south asian food sold concession stand jumped chanted highfived fellow supporter bit rain soaked sunshine historic day usually quiet park electric said chandu talla india fan entrepreneur tampa fla came match son aryan high school junior paid per ticket regret added dream come true see india slow start india came back strong win pakistan naseem shah hit last ball india bowler arshdeep singh india fan erupted cheer pretty good said india bowler jasprit bumrah named player match always india pakistan play lot emotion come feel like lot support people new york area may mostly oblivious match india pakistan two greatest cricketing nation monumental event least south asia cricketloving part world previous time team played last fall viewership reached million india alone according international cricket council year super bowl million viewer sunday attendance constituted largest international cricket match united state according icc attendee included cricketing legend yuvraj singh india pakistan shahid afridi australia ricky ponting omar minaya yankee special adviser former general manager mets cricket match first amazing said atmosphere great like world baseball classic dominican baseball league world cup held every two year nation tournament featuring shorter form cricket year first time event held united state several caribbean nation cricket revered u match also held dallas lauderhill fla new york designated marquee matchup cricket part cultural fabric india pakistan political tension decade forced country play place oh contentious real battle sentiment said narinder kapoor retired u treasury department agent originally new delhi country play real hot potato former amateur cricket player emigrated syosset ny mr kapoor seen cricket match live since although watch sport constantly tv went game ireland canada friday hoped attend sunday big encounter knee ailing stayed home according son sandeep kapoor elder mr kapoor said enjoyed sparsely attended match friday added temporary stadium enough accommodation people disability difficult older people ascend step inside field view excellent said world class security tight match especially website purportedly affiliated terrorist organization isi called attack event mounted police swat unit sniffer dog helicopter large number police officer swarmed area long line formed entrance people went security scanner bruce blakeman nassau county executive said icc defrayed cost security said included local state federal agency including fbi want commend fan mr blakeman said adding everybody polite respectful followed instruction could safe healthy least one exception airplane trailing sign said release imran khan breached restricted airspace stadium match mr khan former pakistani cricket star former prime minister pakistan serving prison sentence mr blakeman said plane eventually intercepted mood park generally upbeat even pakistan fan losing end indiapakistan big deal said temu martin airfreight transport official new jersey pakistan supporter war game said pakistan lost united state last week major upset dallas ticket price sunday match east meadow plummeted said planning travel barbados pakistan next match attend knockoutstage match antigua three match scheduled new york final one wednesday india united state stadium dismantled piece sent sporting event around country mr blakeman predicted nassau county would make million eight new york game tournament time county spent infrastructure planning security said cricket official told could many million viewer worldwide sunday match added said heard investor want bring sport perhaps new york franchise major league cricket nassau county way thing gone last couple week think cricket found home mr blakeman said
nytimes,"Modi, Striking a Modest Tone, Is Sworn In for a Third Term","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/world/asia/india-changed-modi-swearing-in.html,"As a humbled Narendra Modi was sworn in on Sunday for a third term as India’s prime minister, the political air in New Delhi appeared transformed. The election that ended last week stripped Mr. Modi of his parliamentary majority and forced him to turn to a diverse set of coalition partners to stay in power. Now, these other parties are enjoying something that for years was singularly Mr. Modi’s: relevance and the spotlight. Their leaders have been swarmed by TV crews while on their way to present demands and policy opinions to Mr. Modi. His opponents, too, have been getting more airtime, with stations cutting live to their news conferences, something almost unheard-of in recent years. Above all, the change can be seen in Mr. Modi himself. For now, at least, the messianic air is gone. He pitches himself as the modest administrator that voters showed they wanted. “To run the government, a majority is necessary. But to run the nation, a consensus is necessary,” Mr. Modi said in a speech on Friday to members of his coalition ahead of his swearing in. “The people want us to deliver better than before.” A visibly emotional Mr. Modi took the oath of office on Sunday evening, only the second prime minister to be elected for a third consecutive term in the seven decades of India’s republic. The ceremony, at the country’s presidential palace, was attended by about 8,000 supporters and dignitaries, including the leaders of India’s neighboring nations. To many, Mr. Modi’s shift in approach can mean only good things for the country’s democracy — a move toward moderation in a hugely diverse nation that was being whipped into a Hindu-first monolith in the image of one man. The question is whether Mr. Modi can truly become something he has not been during his two-plus decades in elected office: a consensus builder. “He is a pragmatic politician and, for his own survival and for the survival of his party, he will be a little mellowed,” said Ashutosh, a New Delhi-based analyst who uses only one name and is the author of a book on how Indian politics have changed under Mr. Modi. “But to assume a qualitative change in his style of governance is expecting too much.” A trademark of Mr. Modi’s leadership in recent years has been the use of power levers at his disposal — from pressure of police cases to the lure of a share in power and its perks — to break his opponents and get them to switch to his side. A bruised governing party may well try such tactics to peel away some lawmakers to his side, analyst say, to buttress his place at the top. But in the days leading up to the swearing-in, a change in approach was evident. When members of the new coalition packed into the hall of India’s old Parliament building on Friday for deliberations on forming the government, every time a senior ally seated next to him stood up to start his speech, Mr. Modi also stood up. When it was time for Mr. Modi to be garlanded as the coalition’s choice for prime minister, he waited for the leaders of the two main coalition partners to arrive by his side before the congratulatory wreath of purple orchids was placed around his neck. His hourlong address contained none of his usual references to himself in the third person. His tone was measured. He focused on the coalition’s promise of “good governance” and “the dream of a developed India,” and he acknowledged that things would be different from the past 10 years. The last time Mr. Modi came to the Parliament complex for a closely watched event, last May when he inaugurated a new, more modern building for the assembly, he made an entrance some observers compared with that of a king: with markings on his forehead as a sign of piety and a scepter in his hand, as shirtless, chanting Hindu monks walked ahead of and behind him. This time, he went straight to a copy of the Constitution, which declares that India is a secular and socialist democracy, bowing before it and lifting it to his forehead. For the first time in his more than two decades in elected office, Mr. Modi finds himself in uncharted territory. Until now, as long as he has been at the helm — whether at the state level as the chief minister of Gujarat or at the national level — his Bharatiya Janata Party has always had a majority. Analysts say that history of never having been in the opposition has shaped his heavy-handed approach to politics. When he left Gujarat, after 13 years, he had established such a firm grip and had so routed the opposition that the state had effectively become one of single-party rule. His first national victory in 2014, with a majority for his B.J.P., ended decades of coalition governance in India, in which no party had been able to capture the 272 seats in Parliament necessary for a majority. In 2019, he was re-elected with an even bigger majority. Mr. Modi’s enormous power helped swiftly carry out what had for decades been his right-wing party’s agenda, including construction of a lavish Hindu temple on a long-disputed site that once held a mosque, and the revocation of the special status long enjoyed by the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir. A separatist insurgency has long troubled the Himalayan Kashmir region. As the inauguration ceremony began in New Delhi on Sunday, a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims in the Reasi district fell into a gorge after gunmen opened fire on it. At least eight people were killed, the police said. A trademark of Mr. Modi’s governance was a disregard for parliamentary procedures and for debates on legislation. His unexpected, overnight demonetization in 2016 — which invalidated India’s currency in an effort to crack down on corruption — threw the country into chaos and dealt a blow to a still cash-driven economy. Similarly, rushing to enact laws aimed at overhauling the agriculture market resulted in a year of protests that choked Delhi, forcing Mr. Modi to retreat. Before the election results came out, Mr. Modi’s party had predicted that his coalition would win 400 seats in India’s 543-seat Parliament. The opposition would be reduced to sitting “in the spectators’ gallery,” Mr. Modi said. Officials in his government had made clear that in his new term he would seek to put in place the only main item remaining on his party’s agenda: legislating a “uniform civil code” across this diverse country to replace varying laws of different religions that currently govern issues like marriage and inheritance. His party leaders spoke of Mr. Modi not only as their leader for the current term, but also for the next election in 2029, when he would be 78. “He has been trying to transform the country,” Sudesh Verma, a B.J.P. official who wrote a book on Mr. Modi’s rise, said in an interview before the election results were announced. “I look forward to him working like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, who worked into his 90s.” But under a coalition government, Mr. Modi’s traditional approach will be difficult. Two of the main coalition parties that helped him achieve the minimum number of Parliament seats to form a government are secular, in contrast to Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist ideology. N. Chandrababu Naidu, whose party holds 16 seats, has been scathing in the past in his criticism of Mr. Modi’s treatment of the Muslim minority. He has also openly criticized Mr. Modi for using the central investigating agencies to target his opponents and taking “steps to subvert all democratic institutions.” Neerja Chowdhury, a political analyst in Delhi and the author of the 2023 book “How Prime Ministers Decide,” said, “The contentious ideological issues, like the enactment of the uniform civil code, may be put on the back burner if the allies are not comfortable with it.” Mr. Modi’s popular image is built on two strong pillars. He is a champion of economic development, with an inspiring biography of a rise from a humble caste and relative poverty. He is also a lifelong Hindu nationalist, with decades as a foot soldier in a movement seeking to turn India’s secular and diverse state into an overtly Hindu-first place. At the peak of his power, the Hindu nationalist aspect increasingly dominated. Analysts say that the recent rebuke by voters might be a lucky break for the nation: prompting Mr. Modi to tap into his development champion side, and to focus on a legacy of economic transformation that could improve the lives of all Indians.",humbled narendra modi sworn sunday third term india prime minister political air new delhi appeared transformed election ended last week stripped mr modi

nytimes,"India’s Modi, Humbled by Voters, Faces Potent Economic Struggles","June 7, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/business/india-election-modi-economy.html,"Before the Indian election results emerged this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was widely viewed as a charismatic and popular strongman celebrated by the business world for elevating its importance, even as he failed to solve a vexing problem: how to turn swift economic growth into critically needed jobs. After the election, Mr. Modi finds himself staring at that same monumental puzzle, yet relegated to an uncomfortable new status. He is the head of a party that has been chastened at the polls, forcing him to forge a coalition to maintain power. Mr. Modi’s governing authority is likely to be constrained by the complexities of keeping his coalition partners on his side. He could not solve India’s most deep-seated economic challenge when he wielded a monopolistic hold on power. Now, he is a weakened leader who must balance additional interests, while still lacking an obvious way to improve living standards. “There has been a sense that employment growth has been weak in the last four, five years,” said Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic adviser to the Modi administration, who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “How do you create more jobs? This is really India’s central economic challenge, but I think the government will find itself with relatively limited tools.” The humbling of Mr. Modi’s party resonates in part as an expression of popular frustration that India remains a land of economic peril for hundreds of millions of people, as well as a country defined by astonishing contrasts in wealth. In major cities, five-star hotels boasting sumptuous spas look down on teeming slums that lack plumbing. In rural areas, malnutrition prevails under many roofs, and families struggle to find the money to keep children in school. Though its working-age population numbers roughly one billion, India has only 430 million jobs, according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, an independent research institution in Mumbai. And most of those counted as employed are stuck in precarious circumstances as day laborers and farm hands, lacking reliable wages and government workplace protections. Improved livelihoods are evident in many cities, from the high-rise apartments filling out the horizons to air-conditioned shopping malls and luxury cars choking roads. But the gains are narrowly concentrated. Professionals who work in technology centers in the south of the country and around the capital of New Delhi have enjoyed substantial progress. A rapidly growing domestic auto industry is a source of relatively high-paying jobs. Magnates like Gautam Adani, one of Asia’s richest men, have seen their business empires enhanced by their relationships with Mr. Modi and his willingness to eviscerate regulatory impediments to their greater fortune. But most Indian workers are effectively marooned in the so-called informal sector — laboring at roadside stalls, in small shops and in itinerant trades where they have no guarantee of income or the possibility of advancement. The failure of economic growth to yield more jobs is in large part the story of how India missed out on the manufacturing boom that played out in East Asia over recent decades. From South Korea and China to Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, hundreds of millions of people have escaped poverty via wages earned in factories. India has not shared in that transformation in large part because of a historical focus on self-sufficiency, a disdain for international trade and stultifying bureaucracy that has discouraged investment. “The whole manufacturing thing bypassed India,” Mr. Subramanian, the economist, said. “It’s that bigger development failure that is continuing to haunt India.” Mr. Modi has pursued initiatives aimed at bolstering manufacturing and increasing exports. His administration has streamlined regulations and improved ports. Yet despite some high-profile developments like Apple moving the assembly of some iPhones to India, manufacturing makes up only 13 percent of the country’s economy, according to World Bank data. That is a lower share than a decade ago, when Mr. Modi took office. Foreign money has flowed into India’s stock markets, multiplying share prices, a key element of Mr. Modi’s pro-business image. But persuading international investors to put money directly into Indian companies — a riskier bet — has been a harder sell. His Hindu nationalist party has demonized the Muslim minority, a source of social ferment that has raised fears of instability. The election could further discourage additional investment, because Mr. Modi will likely have a more difficult time gaining passage of stalled reforms sought by business, including laws making it easier to amass land and hire and fire workers. With no clear pathway toward economic dynamism and more challenging political circumstances, Mr. Modi might resort to a time-honored method of shoring up support: He will expand social welfare programs, tapping government coffers to hand out more cash to communities in need. Such a course could potentially diminish available funding for the advancement of the government’s signature program — its aggressive construction of highways, ports, airports and other infrastructure. Those plans are central to maintaining India’s strong economic growth and the broader campaign to encourage investment in manufacturing. Some fear that any short-term pursuit of political favor through the scattering of money could undermine the longer-term project of spurring jobs through the promotion of industry. “You need to ensure that the benefits of economic development reach the maximum number of people,” said Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at Global Data.TS Lombard, a forecasting and consulting firm in London. “If people keep depending on welfare and are not getting the benefits of economic development, then it basically just creates stagnation.” Geopolitical alterations appear to give India a fresh crack at growing its manufacturing base. As the United States and China engage in trade hostilities, multinational brands are seeking to reduce their heavy dependence on Chinese factories to make their goods. Major retailers like Walmart are increasingly looking to India as an alternative to China. But capturing that potential investment demands continued upgrading of highways, rail connections and ports, along with a focus on vocational training to give people the needed skills to take up factory work. Even before the election, there were doubts that Mr. Modi’s administration was moving quickly enough to realize these gains. “India is a counterweight to China in terms of geopolitics, and we will continue to see some of that investment flowing,” Ms. Deveshwar said. “But the scale at which they are provisioning the ecosystem for these opportunities just is not large enough.”",indian election

nytimes,The World Heads to the Polls,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/climate/global-elections-climate-change-policy.html,"One of the busiest election cycles in history is coming to an end on Sunday. Hundreds of millions of people have gone to the polls in South Africa, India and Mexico in recent days, and millions more will do the same in the European Union this weekend. As Somini Sengupta has explained in a series of articles this week, among the issues that the new leaders of these countries will face: how to transition away from coal, how to adapt to record-breaking heat and, in Europe’s case, how to address a growing backlash against environmental policies. Today, I want to lay out some the most pressing environmental challenges in these areas, and what the results announced in the past few days point to. Keep in mind that whatever happens in the United States election in November will affect many of these countries, too. The biggest takeaway from India’s elections, as my colleagues who cover the country put it, is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “lost his aura of invincibility.” His Bharatiya Janata Party still won far more seats than any other party, and Modi is set to take up his third consecutive term as prime minister. But his party didn’t win an outright majority and now needs coalition partners to stay in power. Many critics of the current government see the result as good news for democracy, because Modi will be forced to seek support from more moderate allies. It could also bring some relief to activists like Ritwick Dutta, an environmental lawyer whose efforts to defend nature in India have made him a target of the government. But it’s unclear how fewer seats in Parliament will affect Modi’s environmental policies. The main challenges facing the next Indian government are what to do about the effects of climate change, including heat waves that have killed dozens of people. During the elections, at least 33 poll workers were among them, and the heat also closed schools in several states,",one busiest election cycle history coming end sunday hundred million people gone poll south africa india mexico recent day million european union weekend somini sengupta explained series article week among issue new leader country face transition away coal adapt recordbreaking heat europe case address growing backlash environmental policy today want lay pressing environmental challenge area result announced past day point keep mind whatever happens united state election november affect many country biggest takeaway india election colleague cover country put prime minister narendra modi lost aura invincibility bharatiya janata party still far seat party modi set take third consecutive term prime minister party didnt win outright majority need coalition partner stay power many critic current government see result good news democracy modi forced seek support moderate ally could also bring relief activist like ritwick dutta environmental lawyer whose effort defend nature india made target government unclear fewer seat parliament affect modis environmental policy main challenge facing next indian government effect climate change including heat wave killed dozen people election least poll worker among heat also closed school several state
nytimes,Narendra Modi’s India,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/briefing/modis-india.html,"Narendra Modi has just won re-election as India’s prime minister, though by a far narrower margin than expected. With his third consecutive term, the charismatic strongman has still sealed his position as the country’s most significant leader in generations. Despite having led India for a decade, Modi has in some ways kept his country guessing about his vision. On major issues — India’s relationships, its economy, its society and its government — it’s still unclear what sort of country Modi wants India to be. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain four of the big questions. India has spent recent years deepening its relationship with the United States. It has gotten closer to American allies, including Japan and Australia, and ordered high-end American weapons systems — the kind that create dependence down the road. And it is unlikely to side with China. In 2020, Chinese troops crossed into territory controlled by India and killed 20 soldiers in a skirmish. Modi has kept Beijing at arm’s length since then. But Modi, 73, has signaled that he doesn’t want to be a U.S. ally. Some officials in his inner circle still regard the United States warily. American diplomats complain about New Delhi’s apparent efforts to erode democratic norms and the rights of minority groups. So India keeps its options open. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States tried in vain to persuade India to take a stand against the war. India still processes Russian oil (picking up the slack created by international sanctions). It still buys weapons from Russia. India spent the Cold War trying to position itself as a nonaligned power. Old habits die hard. India recently overtook China as the most populous country and the fastest-growing large economy. Still, most of the country remains poor. Some 800 million people need help filling their stomachs. Modi’s ideas about how to help them can be contradictory — they’re both globally minded and protectionist.",narendra modi reelection india prime minister though far narrower margin expected third consecutive term charismatic strongman still sealed position country significant leader generation despite led india decade modi way kept country guessing vision major issue india relationship economy society government still unclear sort country modi want india today newsletter ill explain four big question india spent recent year deepening relationship united state gotten closer american ally including japan australia ordered highend american weapon system kind create dependence road unlikely side china chinese troop crossed territory controlled india killed soldier skirmish modi kept beijing arm length since modi signaled doesnt want u ally official inner circle still regard united state warily american diplomat complain new delhi apparent effort erode democratic norm right minority group india keep option open russia invaded ukraine united state tried vain persuade india take stand war india still process russian oil picking slack created international sanction still buy weapon russia india spent cold war trying position nonaligned power old habit die hard india recently overtook china populous country fastestgrowing large economy still country remains poor million people need help filling stomach modis idea help contradictory theyre globally minded protectionist
nytimes,"In Global Elections, Strongmen Are Taken Down a Notch","June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/world/global-elections-india-turkey-democracy.html,"In India, a powerful leader wins another term but sees his party’s majority vanish. In South Africa, the governing party is humbled by voters for the first time since the end of apartheid. In Britain, a populist insurgent barges into an election that is shaping up to be a crushing defeat for the long-ruling Conservatives. If there is a common thread halfway through this global year of elections, it is a desire by voters to send a strong signal to the powers that be — if not quite a wholesale housecleaning, then a defiant shake-up of the status quo. Even in Mexico, where Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and the handpicked successor of the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was elected in a landslide last Sunday, voters were rewarding the forces that had uprooted the country’s entrenched establishment only six years earlier. With a billion-plus people going to the polls in more than 60 countries, some analysts had feared that 2024 would pose a fateful test for democracy — one that it might fail. For years, populist and strongmen leaders have chipped away at democratic institutions, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of elections, while social media has swamped voters with disinformation and conspiracy theories. In some of the biggest, most fragile democracies, leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey had been regarded as close to invincible, using appeals to nationalism or sectarianism to mobilize supporters and bending institutions to suit their purposes. Yet now, Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan have both had their wings clipped. Soaring inflation, chronic unemployment and uneven economic growth have widened inequality in India, Turkey and elsewhere, frustrating voters who have shown a willingness to buck the establishment. “We do have electoral systems that are producing outcomes the governing parties didn’t want,” said Ben Ansell, a professor of comparative democratic institutions at the University of Oxford. “They’ve all been destabilized by a tricky economic environment, and behaving like strongmen hasn’t saved them.” Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan remain in power, each now in his third term. But Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., lost dozens of seats and will have to govern in a coalition with two secular parties. Turkey’s opposition struck a blow against Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party in April, winning a string of local elections and solidifying its control of important cities like Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. “In a lot of countries where there’s been talk of backsliding, that’s where we’ve seen a bounce back,” Professor Ansell said. “For Modi and Erdogan, taking the sheen off their infallibility was very important.” With so many elections in so many countries, it is dangerous to generalize. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia rolled up 88 percent of the vote in a landslide re-election victory in March that spoke less to Russian public sentiment and more to the ability of an autocrat, facing no meaningful opposition, to stage-manage a show of support for his war in Ukraine. In Europe, far-right parties are expected to perform well in European Parliament elections, which began on Thursday. Analysts said they did not believe this would jeopardize the political center that has governed Europe in the post-World War II era. And Poland provided a source of reassurance last fall, when voters pushed out its nationalist Law and Justice Party in favor of a more liberal opposition. Still, the success of far-right figures like Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy, attests to the enduring appeal of populism. “Populists and right-wingers will continue to make gains and strike fear into the European political establishment,” the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said in its analysis of the top risks of 2024. Britain’s general election was shaken up on Monday when Nigel Farage, a populist politician, pro-Brexit campaigner and ally of former President Donald J. Trump, announced he would run for a seat in Parliament under the banner of his Reform U.K. party, which has a strident anti-immigration message. That will add to the headache for the Conservative Party, which has lagged the opposition Labour Party by double digits in polls for nearly 18 months. Reform, which is fielding candidates across the country, could siphon off Conservative votes among those who blame the party for a weak economy and rising immigration numbers since Britain left the European Union in 2020. Some critics argue that the Conservative Party’s problems stem from its free-market policies, which they say have disillusioned voters in disadvantaged parts of Britain and set it apart from right-wing parties in Europe or Mr. Trump’s Make America Great Again movement in the United States. More fundamentally, though, the Conservatives have been in power for 14 years, and they face the same pent-up dissatisfaction with the status quo that fueled the recent elections in India, South Africa and Turkey. In some countries, the urge to break with the past has led voters to make unorthodox choices: Javier Milei, a flamboyant libertarian economist, swept to power in Argentina last November with a promise to close its central bank and wage an all-out assault on what he described as a corrupt political “caste.” Some analysts argue that similarly disruptive forces are driving the presidential race in the United States, where a comparatively healthy economy and the advantages of incumbency have not spared President Biden, who faces a neck-and-neck challenge from Mr. Trump even after the former president was convicted of multiple felonies. “It’s not about left versus right, it’s about the status quo versus change,” said Frank Luntz, an American political strategist who has lived and worked in Britain. “You can’t buy a house in the U.K., the N.H.S. doesn’t work,” he said, referring to the National Health Service. “In the United States, you can’t afford housing or health care. It’s about broken promises, year after year after year.” That sense of betrayal is even more acute in countries like South Africa, where the African National Congress, or A.N.C., has governed since the start of democracy there in 1994, piling up majorities even as the economy and social infrastructure crumbled. Last week, voters finally rebelled, driving down the A.N.C.’s vote share to 40 percent, from 58 percent in the last national election in 2019. Among their biggest complaints is the lack of job opportunities: South Africa’s unemployment rate — at 42 percent, including those who have stopped looking for work — is one of the highest in the world. Stagnation has widened the country’s already profound inequality. South Africans flock to cities looking for work. But many end up in decrepit buildings and slapdash shack communities, often without running water or sanitary toilets. Regular power outages leave streets dark and residents of many communities vulnerable to crime. South Africa’s murder rate is six and a half times as high as that of the United States and 45 times as high as Germany’s. Jacob Zuma, the scandal-scarred former president, has benefited from this misery, helping start a new party, umKhonto weSizwe, or M.K., which won nearly 15 percent of the vote, mostly at the expense of his former party, the A.N.C. Mr. Zuma attracts a feverish following among disillusioned A.N.C. supporters, who accuse the party of selling out to wealthy white businesspeople and not moving aggressively enough to redistribute wealth to the Black majority after apartheid. India’s election was a comparable anti-incumbent revolt, even if Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. is still the largest party in Parliament by a wide margin. The party’s campaign spending was at least 20 times as much as that of its main opposition, the Congress Party, which had its bank accounts frozen by the government in a tax dispute on the eve of the election. The country’s news outlets have been largely bought off or bullied into silence. And yet, the results showed Mr. Modi, 73, losing his majority for the first time since he took office in 2014. Analysts said that reflected widespread dissatisfaction with how the fruits of India’s economy have been shared. While India’s steady growth has made it the envy of its neighbors — and created a conspicuous billionaire class — those riches have not flowed to the hundreds of millions of India’s poor. The government has handed out free rations of wheat, grain and cooking gas. It offers home water connections, subsidizes building supplies and gives farmers cash. But it has not tackled India’s inflation or unemployment, leaving hundreds of millions of people, especially women, chronically out of work. There is also some evidence that Mr. Modi’s appeals to Hindu nationalism were not as potent as in previous elections. The B.J.P.’s candidate did not even win the constituency that is home to the lavish Ram temple, built on grounds disputed by Hindus and Muslims. Mr. Modi inaugurated the temple just before the campaign started, hoping it would galvanize his Hindu political base. The economy figured into Mexico’s election as well, but in a very different way. While overall growth was disappointing — averaging only 1 percent a year during Mr. López Obrador’s term — the government doubled the minimum wage and strengthened the peso, lifting millions of Mexicans out of poverty. “People vote with their wallets, and it’s very obvious there’s more money in the wallets of almost everybody in Mexico,” said Diego Casteñeda Garza, a Mexican economist and historian at Uppsala University in Sweden. Still, analysts said, there was also a desire among voters to cement the change that Mr. López Obrador, a charismatic outsider, symbolized when he came to power in 2018. Even as Ms. Sheinbaum, 61, vowed to continue her mentor’s policies, she cast herself — Mexico’s first female and Jewish president — as a change agent. For Jacqueline González, 33, who works at a cargo transportation company and viewed Mexico’s previous governments as corrupt, that made voting for Ms. Sheinbaum an easy decision. “With Obrador we have already seen, although some people don’t want to admit it, some change,” Ms. González said. “Let’s hope it continues with Sheinbaum.”",india powerful leader win another term see party majority vanish

nytimes,"Rahul Gandhi, Long on the Ropes, Looks Set for an Unexpected Comeback","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-congress-rahul-gandhi.html,"Just last year, Rahul Gandhi and the once-powerful party he led, the Indian National Congress, seemed to be on the ropes and little threat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s consolidation of political power. Congress had not been a competitive factor in national elections in years, winning fewer and fewer votes each time Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party was elected. And Mr. Gandhi himself had been convicted on a slander charge and barred from holding a seat in Parliament. But on Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi and a broad opposition coalition led by his Congress party registered a far stronger showing than expected in India’s elections, setting the stage for an unlikely comeback. “He has finally arrived,” said Rasheed Kidwai, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi. “This time he has improved his vote share by at least 17 million votes, which is very substantial.” On Wednesday, Mr. Modi’s party announced that it had reached an agreement to form a governing coalition, including two parties that do not necessarily share its vision. Congress won 99 seats in the 543-seat Parliament, a gain of 47 seats, and the alliance of which it is the leading part won a total of 232. Congress and its alliance of over two dozen political groups have presented the results as a “moral victory” over a B.J.P. government that they say was trying to change the country’s Constitution and have portrayed as anathema to India’s identity as a multifaith and secular country. “The fight was to save the Constitution,” Mr. Gandhi, the son, grandson and great-grandson of Congress prime ministers, said as the results poured in. The first major sign that Congress might be able to contend came in May 2023, just a couple of months after Mr. Gandhi’s conviction for slander, when his party won the state government of Karnataka, in the south of India, from the B.J.P. The lift was temporary; Congress soon lost power in three states it governed to the B.J.P. But at the same time, political experts say, Mr. Gandhi was pushing for changes within the party, India’s oldest, which had long resisted overhauling an archaic organizational structure that kept its top leaders isolated from the grass-roots workers who deliver votes. Feelings that Congress’s leaders were corrupt and out of touch resulted in a string of defeats over a number of years and then degenerated into messy infighting within the party. For the past two years, party members say, Mr. Gandhi has tried to reverse the decline of Congress by surrounding himself with young policy analysts to help him understand the challenges facing India, as well as party veterans with their ears to the ground in towns and villages that Congress was targeting. The party has in addition improved its social media game, trumpeting its messages on platforms like WhatsApp and YouTube. Mr. Gandhi also raised his profile by embarking on two walks across India — meeting farmers in their fields and vegetable sellers on city streets; and drinking tea with recent graduates and gig workers — in an effort to show common cause with ordinary people. Perhaps most important, Congress focused on a strategy of reaching out to and cooperating with key regional players across the country whose influence had dimmed under B.J.P. rule. Congress leaders made a series of “seat-sharing” agreements with regional leaders, big and small, that strengthened the alliance against Mr. Modi’s party. To avoid splitting the anti-B.J.P. vote, Congress had its own candidates contest fewer seats. And Mr. Gandhi campaigned vigorously alongside the leaders of like-minded political groups across India. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Gandhi also won support, party leaders say, by characterizing Mr. Modi as a leader who would destroy India’s secular character. “It is a victory not just for him and our alliance partners but for the millions of poor Indians who voted to protect the secular fabric of this country,” said Srinivas B.V., another Congress leader, about Mr. Gandhi. “People showed Modi: ‘You are not God, and you can be replaced.’” Since being voted to power in 2014, Mr. Modi has sought to position Hinduism, the religion of some 80 percent of Indians, at the center of the country’s official identity. He also promised to end corruption, overhaul the economy and help India become a “developed nation” by 2047. But after his re-election in 2019, he leaned into Hindu themes to a greater extent. Mr. Gandhi’s efforts to contrast his vision for India with Mr. Modi’s largely paid off, analysts say, even if some members of his party jumped ship and sided with the B.J.P. Many of the politicians who defected from Congress to the B.J.P. lost their seats, including in West Bengal and Maharashtra, where Congress and its partners did especially well. Throughout the campaign Mr. Gandhi persistently linked Mr. Modi with Gautam Adani, Asia’s richest man, saying the prime minister was working for his tycoon friends, not for the vast majority of Indians who are poor. As if to vindicate this line of attack, over the two days after the election results were announced, the price of Mr. Adani’s flagship stock fell by 14 percent. (It then recovered somewhat on Wednesday.) “People directly correlate Adani Ji with Modi Ji — directly,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters after the results, using Hindi honorifics for the two men. Researchers who traveled across India during the voting said Mr. Gandhi had beaten Mr. Modi on his own turf in many places by focusing on issues like the millions of Indians without jobs and the economic difficulties faced by farmers. He also accused the B.J.P. of governance failures and worked with local political groups fighting for social justice and for the empowerment of lower-caste Indians. Uttar Pradesh, where Mr. Modi made dozens of visits to campaign for local candidates, is one state where the changing fortunes of the two largest political groupings was evident. The state is India’s largest, and accounts for 80 of the Parliament’s 543 seats. The B.J.P. recorded its worst performance there since 2009, in part because Mr. Gandhi was able to craft an alliance with a powerful local leader, Akhilesh Yadav. In addition to the 37 seats picked up by Mr. Yadav’s Samajwadi Party, Congress won six, helped by aggressive campaigning by Mr. Gandhi’s sister, Priyanka Vadra, who helped defeat a former soap-opera actress who had served as a minister in Mr. Modi’s government. The B.J.P. won 33 seats, down from 62 in the previous Parliament. The election results announced on Wednesday have given a major lift to hundreds of thousands of Congress workers across the country, who were growing tired of the internal infighting that has plagued their party for years. Outside Congress headquarters in New Delhi, Bansi Lal Meena, a veteran Congress member from the state of Rajasthan, was exultant about his party’s performance. “In villages and on the ground, the B.J.P. spread lies for years against us — saying that we are anti-Hindu,” he said. “They used my religion as a weapon against me to win votes.” He added: “We will show them now because our people are also in Parliament.”",last year rahul gandhi oncepowerful party led indian national congress seemed rope little threat prime minister narendra modis consolidation political power congress competitive

nytimes,Narendra Modi Fell to Earth After Making It All About Himself,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-election-modi.html,"When everything became about Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, his party and its century-old Hindu-nationalist network were propelled to unimagined heights. On the back of his singular charisma and political skill, a onetime-fringe religious ideology was pulled to the center of Indian life. Landslide election victories remade India’s politics, once dominated by diverse coalitions representing a nation that had shaped its independence on secular principles. But there were always risks in wrapping a party’s fortunes so completely in the image of one man, in inundating a country of many religions, castes and cultures with that leader’s name, face and voice. Voters could start to think that everything was about him, not them. They could even revolt. On Tuesday, Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., fell back to earth. After having promised their biggest election romp yet, they lost more than 60 seats. Mr. Modi will remain in office for a third term, but only with the help of a contentious coalition of parties, some of which are opposed to his core beliefs and want power of their own. With the result, India’s strained democracy appeared to roar back to life, its beaten-down political opposition reinvigorated. And after a decade in which Mr. Modi’s success in entrenching Hindu supremacy had often felt like the new common sense, India is seeing its leader and itself in a new light, and trying to understand this unexpected turn. Most fundamentally, the opposition, newly coalesced for what it called a do-or-die moment as Mr. Modi increasingly tilted the playing field, found a way to use the cult of personality around him to its advantage. Opposition leaders focused on bread-and-butter issues, often at granular levels in particular constituencies. They hammered Mr. Modi over persistent unemployment and stark inequality. But the B.J.P., with Mr. Modi from on high its only spokesman, was often left with just one answer: Trust in “Modi’s guarantee.” “The ‘Modi’s guarantee’ slogan turned out to be our undoing,” said Ajay Singh Gaur, a B.J.P. worker who had campaigned in the party stronghold of Uttar Pradesh, the northern state where Mr. Modi suffered his biggest blow on Tuesday, losing nearly half of the B.J.P. seats. “The opposition made that sound like this was not about him having delivered, or trying to deliver,” Mr. Gaur said, “but about him being an arrogant politician.” Mr. Modi gave his adversaries a lot to work with, even declaring that he may not be “biological” and that he had been sent by God. He has still emerged better so far than other Indian leaders who deeply centralized power. He remains in control of levers of power that could help him and his party restore their dominance. Indira Gandhi, who had also glorified herself and went so far as to suspend India’s democracy after declaring a national emergency, was voted out at the peak of her powers before returning three years later. But Mr. Modi’s B.J.P., the world’s largest political party, finds itself in a tough spot after years of centralization and reliance on a government machinery put to the service of one man, analysts say. The huge advantage the party has built in numbers and resources is undercut by a lack of internal consultation and delegation of authority. That was a key reason for its failure in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, with 240 million people, and surrounding states. Local B.J.P. leaders were disenchanted by a top-down approach toward choosing candidates, as well as what they called a misguided belief that Mr. Modi’s popularity could allow the party to sidestep potent local issues and caste factors. With Mr. Modi sucking up all the oxygen at the top, other senior leaders of the party have been left to fight for relevance and a voice. His relentless self-promotion has also alienated the leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., the B.J.P.’s right-wing fountainhead. During election seasons, the R.S.S. activates its vast grass-roots network in support of B.J.P. candidates. While Mr. Modi, a former foot soldier in the organization, has advanced many of its goals, his consolidation of power goes against its regimented nature and its focus on ideology over individual personalities. One R.S.S. insider, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking, said that Mr. Modi’s exalting of himself had created such resentment inside the group that some of its leaders welcomed any sort of reality check for him, short of his ouster. Sudheendra Kulkarni, a political analyst who served as an aide to the first B.J.P. prime minister in the 1990s, said Mr. Modi had pushed through unpopular legislation — in particular farm laws that prompted a yearlong protest that choked New Delhi — without consulting with party officials in the affected states. They were left to cope with the ramifications. “The B.J.P. was never a one-leader party,” Mr. Kulkarni said. “All that changed with Narendra Modi in 2014. He sought to promote a new authoritarian idea of one nation, one leader.” Hypothesizing that Mr. Modi’s popularity had peaked, the opposition saw an opening to go after a decisive section of votes in the Indian political formula. For decades before his rise in 2014, neither the B.J.P. nor the Indian National Congress, the country’s two largest parties, could muster majorities on its own. Mr. Modi expanded his party’s backing by consolidating right-wing Hindu voters and drawing in new supporters with his personal story of a humble caste and economic background and a promise to change lives through robust development. A decade later, in this year’s election, the opposition found traction in painting a very different picture of Mr. Modi — as an autocratic friend of billionaires. Since Mr. Modi had achieved everything he had set out to do, the opposition argued, his pursuit of a resounding majority could only mean that he would seek radical change to the Constitution. That claim stirred anxiety among India’s Dalits and other underprivileged groups, who see the Constitution as their only protection in a deeply unequal society, guaranteeing them a share of government jobs and seats in higher education as well as elected bodies. The opposition was able to push the message harder when some in Mr. Modi’s right-wing support base, long seen as having an upper-caste bias, called for revoking the quotas. Caste identity was a major driving factor for voters in many states, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, with its 80 parliamentary seats. The decline of a Dalit party in the state meant that about 20 percent of the votes were potentially up for grabs. In Ayodhya, the constituency where Mr. Modi inaugurated a grand Ram temple earlier this year in an effort to consolidate his Hindu support base, the opposition put up a Dalit candidate. He handily defeated the B.J.P.’s two-term incumbent. In other cases, voters showed their anger over the B.J.P.’s perceived sense of impunity. In Kheri, a constituency where the son of a B.J.P. minister rammed his S.U.V. into a crowd of protesting farmers, killing several, the minister also lost. Mr. Modi’s election campaign took its most divisive turn in Banswara, in the desert state of Rajasthan, where he called India’s 200 million Muslims “infiltrators” and raised fears that the opposition would give them India’s wealth, including Hindu women’s necklaces. Banswara’s B.J.P. incumbent was routed in the election. While the loss was most likely attributable to local issues, the national discussion noted that Mr. Modi’s comments had not helped. In his own constituency of Varanasi, in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Modi’s winning margin of nearly half a million votes in 2019 shrank to about 150,000 — a disappointing showing after he had dispatched some of the B.J.P.’s most senior leaders to camp out there to help him achieve an even bigger victory. Jai Prakash, a tea and samosa seller in Varanasi, said some of the prime minister’s work, particularly his improvement of roads, was popular. But Mr. Modi was losing the plot, Mr. Prakash said, by turning to issues disconnected from people’s day-to-day lives. “Prices are skyrocketing; so is unemployment,” Mr. Prakash said. “He has done some good. But people cannot worship him endlessly.”",everything became prime minister narendra modi india party centuryold hindunationalist network propelled unimagined height back singular charisma political

nytimes,"India Keeps Its Glorious, Messy Tradition Alive","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/opinion/india-election-modi-bjp-democracy.html,"Back in January, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India looked all but unstoppable, he visited the small city of Ayodhya for the unofficial start of his campaign to win a third term. The location was freighted with symbolism. For decades, Hindu nationalists had sought to build a temple in Ayodhya, at a spot they believe to be the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. The only problem was that there was already a house of worship on the spot, a mosque built by a Mughal emperor in 1528. A Hindu mob had dismantled the mosque in 1992, setting off riots that killed 2,000 people, most of them Muslims. The ruins were a flashpoint of religious tensions in India for decades. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party promised to build the temple, and the lavish event at which Modi officially opened it was a showcase for that achievement. At the time it seemed like strong election-year messaging for a politician who built his career on the twin planks of Hindu nationalism and building a muscular new India. Unlike other politicians, the event implied, Modi made promises and kept them. “It is the beginning of a new era,” he declared. Feeling supremely confident, Modi had boldly asked the Indian electorate for something akin to a blank check to remake the country — control of 400 seats in Parliament in elections that began in April and concluded on June 1. And why shouldn’t he have been confident? India’s economy was the fastest-growing in the world. India had overtaken China as the world’s most-populous country. World leaders sought Modi’s support on issues ranging from the war in Ukraine to the climate crisis, cementing India’s ascent in global affairs. But the ever unpredictable electorate of the world’s largest democracy responded to Modi’s demand for still more power resolutely: No thanks. In a stunning rebuke, election results released on Tuesday showed that India’s voters have reduced the parliamentary share of Modi’s party by more than 60 seats, not enough for an outright majority, never mind the supermajority he had sought. It struck me as particularly apt that despite all the fanfare about the glorious new temple in Ayodhya, Modi’s party lost the city’s parliamentary seat to a political opposition that had been all but left for dead.",back january prime minister narendra modi india looked unstoppable visited small city ayodhya unofficial start campaign win third term location freighted symbolism decade hindu nationalist sought build temple ayodhya spot believe birthplace hindu god ram problem already house worship spot mosque built mughal emperor hindu mob dismantled mosque setting riot killed people muslim ruin flashpoint religious tension india decade modi bharatiya janata party promised build temple lavish event modi officially opened showcase achievement time seemed like strong electionyear messaging politician built career twin plank hindu nationalism building muscular new india unlike politician event implied modi made promise kept beginning new era declared feeling supremely confident modi boldly asked indian electorate something akin blank check remake country control seat parliament election began april concluded june shouldnt confident india economy fastestgrowing world india overtaken china world mostpopulous country world leader sought modis support issue ranging war ukraine climate crisis cementing india ascent global affair ever unpredictable electorate world largest democracy responded modis demand still power resolutely thanks stunning rebuke election result released tuesday showed india voter reduced parliamentary share modis party seat enough outright majority never mind supermajority sought struck particularly apt despite fanfare glorious new temple ayodhya modis party lost city parliamentary seat political opposition left dead
nytimes,The New Kingmakers Who Could Make or Break Modi’s Government,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-elections-modi-coalition.html,"After his first two national election victories, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India easily set his own terms, with his Bharatiya Janata Party winning clear majorities. The result was different in this vote. It was still a victory, but one that left him dependent on a host of coalition partners — particularly on politicians from two regional parties who could make or break Mr. Modi’s ability to form a government. Of the more than a dozen parties that make up the B.J.P.’s coalition, known as the National Democratic Alliance, most won just one or two seats, leaving the party in a difficult predicament. On Wednesday, the B.J.P. said it had reached an agreement to form a coalition government that includes those two regional parties — the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United. They will be the biggest junior partners, but they are also avowedly secular and removed from Mr. Modi’s Hindu-nationalist ideology. Cameras on Wednesday followed every word, meeting and movement of the leaders of the two parties, N. Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party, and Nitish Kumar of Janata Dal-United. Their combined 28 seats in Parliament will give the prime minister the votes he needs to stay in power and push through his agenda. Here is what to know about the men who unexpectedly found themselves as kingmakers, and about the parties they lead. Though some of the members of the B.J.P.’s coalition this year share Mr. Modi’s hard-line vision, both the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United are moderate, secular parties that have a diverse support base. Speculation in India was focusing on what terms the men were demanding for their support, which are unlikely to be rooted in ideology. Both Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar are known to be pragmatic, deal-making politicians whose priorities will be practical concessions for their state, or perhaps cabinet positions. Mr. Kumar has earned a reputation in India for his willingness to switch allegiances over the past decade. He has gone between aligning himself with the B.J.P.-led coalition to supporting its rivals no fewer than five times. Most recently, in January, he returned to Mr. Modi’s alliance just 18 months after he’d left it and with just months to go until the election. He has said his switching of political loyalties was in the interest of his state, Bihar. Mr. Naidu has also at times broken with Mr. Modi, cutting ties with the B.J.P. in 2018 and joining forces with its chief rival, Indian National Congress, ahead of the 2019 elections. He has said that his party has aligned with the B.J.P. out of “political compulsion.” Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar have both been in politics for decades, and have been mentioned as potential candidates for prime minister. Mr. Naidu of the T.D.P., based in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, is a technocrat who has aggressively pushed for investment from information technology companies in his region. His policies helped bring high-paying jobs for I.T. professionals and transformed the city of Hyderabad. Mr. Kumar is a nine-time chief minister of Bihar, India’s poorest state, who comes from a homegrown socialist background. He has pushed for more funds for low-caste Hindus, and his alliance with the B.J.P. broadened support for the party in his state.",first two national election victory prime minister narendra modi india easily set term bharatiya janata party winning clear majority result different vote still victory one left dependent host coalition partner particularly politician two regional party could make break mr modis ability form government dozen party make bjps coalition known national democratic alliance one two seat leaving party difficult predicament wednesday bjp said reached agreement form coalition government includes two regional party telugu desam party janata dalunited biggest junior partner also avowedly secular removed mr modis hindunationalist ideology camera wednesday followed every word meeting movement leader two party n chandrababu naidu telugu desam party nitish kumar janata dalunited combined seat parliament give prime minister vote need stay power push agenda know men unexpectedly found kingmaker party lead though member bjps coalition year share mr modis hardline vision telugu desam party janata dalunited moderate secular party diverse support base speculation india focusing term men demanding support unlikely rooted ideology mr naidu mr kumar known pragmatic dealmaking politician whose priority practical concession state perhaps cabinet position mr kumar earned reputation india willingness switch allegiance past decade gone aligning bjpled coalition supporting rival fewer five time recently january returned mr modis alliance month hed left month go election said switching political loyalty interest state bihar mr naidu also time broken mr modi cutting tie bjp joining force chief rival indian national congress ahead election said party aligned bjp political compulsion mr naidu mr kumar politics decade mentioned potential candidate prime minister mr naidu tdp based southern state andhra pradesh technocrat aggressively pushed investment information technology company region policy helped bring highpaying job professional transformed city hyderabad mr kumar ninetime chief minister bihar india poorest state come homegrown socialist background pushed fund lowcaste hindu alliance bjp broadened support party state
nytimes,"Modi se reelige en India, pero pierde mayoría parlamentaria: 4 claves de las elecciones","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/06/05/espanol/elecciones-india-modi.html,"[Estamos en WhatsApp. Empieza a seguirnos ahora] La primera década de Narendra Modi como primer ministro de India ha estado plagada de sorpresas. Ninguna, sin embargo, se comparó con lo que ocurrió el martes por la mañana, cuando Modi ganó su segunda reelección, pero su partido perdió la mayoría en el Parlamento. Con esa derrota, el aire de invencibilidad de Modi también pareció desvanecerse por primera vez desde que asumió el cargo en 2014. Los resultados de las elecciones fueron particularmente interesantes porque, tras casi siete semanas de votaciones en todo el país, las encuestas a pie de urna publicadas pocos días antes del recuento final mostraban que el Partido Popular Indio de Modi ganaría de forma aplastante, como ya había hecho en dos ocasiones anteriores. Sin embargo, el Partido Popular Indio solo obtuvo 239 escaños, muy por debajo de los 272 necesarios para formar gobierno. La alianza de la oposición, liderada por el Partido del Congreso Nacional Indio, obtuvo 235 escaños. Con los 52 escaños obtenidos por los aliados del Partido Popular Indio, Modi seguirá a la cabeza. Pero su atractivo ha disminuido y su liderazgo ha cambiado radicalmente. Cuando Modi llegó al poder en 2014, prometió progreso económico, el fin de la corrupción y la promoción del hinduismo como elemento central de la identidad india. Con todo ello, se presentó como un líder singularmente fuerte, capaz de reunir a sus seguidores para trabajar por la nación. Esto contrastaba con el gobierno anterior. Antes de que Modi fuera elegido por primera vez, India llevaba 25 años gobernada por coaliciones. Los primeros ministros del Partido del Congreso, del Partido Popular Indio y de terceros partidos más pequeños se alternaban para dirigir India por comités. Modi rompió con esa tradición y lideró un nuevo sistema de partido único dominado por el Partido Popular Indio. Como líder, Modi mostró poco interés en compartir el poder. Cuando invalidó la mayor parte del papel moneda de India en 2016, ni siquiera su ministro de Finanzas conocía la decisión de antemano. Cuando decidió imponer la ley marcial en Jammu y Cachemira, el único estado de mayoría musulmana de India, presentó el plan al Parlamento como un hecho, sin pedir su aprobación. Pero esos días han terminado. Los dos mayores partidos que han surgido como nuevos socios de coalición del Partido Popular Indio están liderados por N. Chandrababu Naidu y Nitish Kumar, legisladores veteranos a quienes se conoce como tecnócratas moderados. Es probable que ambos exijan más autoridad en el Parlamento. De hecho, ambos han sido señalados como posibles candidatos a primer ministro, si se produjera otra coalición que no estuviera liderada ni por el Partido Popular Indio ni por el Congreso Nacional Indio. Cuando el martes se dieron a conocer los primeros mapas electorales nacionales que mostraban el número de escaños ganados y perdidos en el Parlamento, se observó una nueva y sorprendente configuración. Los mapas mostraban que el partido de Modi había perdido zonas de territorio en los estados del norte de habla hindi, considerados bastiones del Partido Popular Indio. Al mismo tiempo, el su partido avanzó en regiones que se habían resistido a Modi en el pasado. Perdió decenas de escaños en el estado septentrional de Uttar Pradesh, pero ganó muchos en el estado oriental de Odisha y en el estado meridional de Telangana. La única parte del país que ahora parece unificada por un partido es el “cinturón tribal”, que atraviesa los estados centrales. Sus comunidades relativamente pobres han sido hábilmente puestas en la mira de la política hinduista y los beneficios sociales del Partido Popular Indio. Los inversores de los mercados bursátiles indios de Mumbai respondieron con entusiasmo a las primeras encuestas a pie de urna. El lunes, se lanzaron a la compra, haciendo subir los precios de las llamadas acciones de Modi, aquellas asociadas a las prioridades de gasto del primer ministro o que se cree que se benefician de sus políticas fiscales. Cuando se conocieron los resultados de las urnas, esas acciones se desplomaron. Las acciones del buque insignia del Grupo Adani perdieron cerca del 19 por ciento de su valor en un solo día de cotización. El índice bursátil perdió cerca del 6 por ciento, casi anulando las ganancias de los cinco primeros meses del año. Modi sigue siendo popular entre los magnates de India, pero los inversores deben averiguar qué empresas se beneficiarán del nuevo gobierno. Chris Wood, responsable mundial de estrategia de renta variable del banco de inversión Jefferies, advirtió el año pasado que si Modi perdía, “cabría esperar una corrección del 25 por ciento, si no más”, en el mercado bursátil indio. Históricamente, a las empresas indias les ha ido igual de bien durante los periodos de gobierno de coalición. Por lo tanto, Wood dijo que, incluso sin Modi en el poder, espera que las acciones “se recuperen bruscamente” sobre la base de la fortaleza de la economía del país en su conjunto. Esta nueva era en el Parlamento empezará seguramente con algunas rondas de retribuciones políticas. Los políticos que no hayan conseguido escaños para sus jefes serán despedidos. Es probable que los partidos más pequeños exijan puestos en el gabinete, lo que significará sustituir a miembros del Partido Popular Indio. Habrá que revisar las políticas. ¿Se inclinará India por la exportación de manufacturas, con el objetivo de sustituir a China como la fábrica del mundo? ¿Protegerá ahora a las industrias locales que temen la competencia extranjera? Milan Vaishnav, investigador de la Fundación Carnegie para la Paz Internacional, advirtió que India no puede volver exactamente a la política de coalición que precedió a Modi. Es probable que sus nuevos socios exijan un estilo autoritario similar al que Modi ejerce desde Nueva Delhi. El tipo de líderes estatales que necesita ahora como socios de coalición “son tan absolutistas como el gobierno nacional”, dijo Vaishnav. Podrían, por ejemplo, pedir a la policía federal que detuviera a sus oponentes, como ha hecho Modi. Las elecciones de India fueron las mayores celebradas en la historia de la democracia, con más de 600 millones de votantes en seis fases. Esta vez no hubo quejas sobre las máquinas de votación electrónica, ni temores de que India se hubiera convertido en una dictadura bajo el mandato de Modi. En un discurso difícil pronunciado el martes por la noche desde la sede del Partido Popular Indio, Modi calificó las elecciones de “celebración de la democracia”.",estamos en whatsapp empieza

nytimes,Man Accused in Plot to Assassinate Sikh Separatist Pleads Not Guilty,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/nyregion/nikhil-gupta-india-assassination-plot.html,"An Indian man pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of orchestrating a failed assassination plot against a Sikh separatist in New York, a plan that prosecutors say he devised on behalf of an unnamed official in India’s government. The defendant, Nikhil Gupta, 52, was arrested in the Czech Republic a year ago, and was extradited last week to make his first appearance in Manhattan federal court. He is accused of trying to arrange the murder of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American citizen and lawyer for a New York-based Sikh secessionist group. The murder attempt, which played out against a backdrop of doubt about India’s commitment to democracy, spanned several countries and mirrored the successful killing of another separatist in Canada, prosecutors say. On Monday morning, Mr. Gupta entered the Lower Manhattan courtroom in a blue cardigan and yellow patterned shirt and appeared relaxed as he spoke to his lawyer, Jeffrey Chabrowe, at the defense table. He has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since landing in the United States on Friday afternoon. In a statement to reporters after the arraignment, Mr. Chabrowe called the case a “complex matter"" for India and the United States. “Background and details will develop that may cast government allegations into an entirely new light,” he said. Mr. Gupta is charged with murder for hire and conspiracy to commit murder for hire. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison for each charge. He was sent back to the detention center after Monday’s arraignment and is set to appear in court again on June 28. In a statement Monday, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said Mr. Gupta will “now face justice” in an American courtroom. “This extradition makes clear that the Justice Department will not tolerate attempts to silence or harm American citizens,” he said. In an indictment unsealed in November, Manhattan federal prosecutors described an audacious plot that began around May 2023 when an Indian government employee enlisted Mr. Gupta to organize the killing of Mr. Pannun, who was living in New York at the time. Mr. Pannun is the general counsel of Sikhs for Justice, an organization that supports the secession of Punjab, a state in northern India. He is a vocal critic of the Indian government and has been banned from the country, prosecutors say. Mr. Gupta, who lived in India, had told the government official about “his involvement in international narcotics and weapons trafficking,” according to the indictment. At the direction of the Indian government employee, Mr. Gupta contacted a man who he believed would help him hire a hit man in New York, but who was, in fact, an agent for the American government. That agent introduced Mr. Gupta to an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration officer who pretended to be the hit man. In deals brokered by Mr. Gupta, the Indian government official agreed to pay the D.E.A. officer $100,000 to kill Mr. Pannun, including a $15,000 cash advance for the job, prosecutors said. Mr. Gupta then shared personal information about Mr. Pannun with the undercover officer, including Mr. Pannun’s address in New York and his phone number. When the Indian official asked for updates, Mr. Gupta relayed surveillance photos of Mr. Pannun that the agent had sent him. Mr. Gupta instructed the undercover officer to carry out the assassination as soon as possible, but asked him not to do it around the time of high-level meetings between U.S. and Indian officials, according to the indictment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington and met with President Biden in June 2023. Then, prosecutors said, on June 18 of that year, gunmen killed Hardeep Singh Nijjar, another Sikh separatist leader, in British Columbia, Canada. Mr. Nijjar knew Mr. Pannun and was also an outspoken critic of the Indian government. Soon after, prosecutors said, Mr. Gupta told the undercover officer that Mr. Nijjar “was also the target” and that “we have so many targets.” Mr. Gupta then told the officer — the pretend hit man — that there was “now no need to wait” to kill Mr. Pannun, prosecutors said. On Monday, Mr. Pannun said in a statement that he had “full faith” that the United States would hold Mr. Gupta and his co-conspirators accountable. “The attempt on my life on American soil is the blatant case of India’s transnational terrorism challenging America’s sovereignty and unequivocally proves that Modi’s India believes in using violence to suppress the dissenting political opinion,” he said. A spokesman for the Indian Embassy in Washington, D.C., could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. Mr. Gupta’s case has threatened to complicate the delicate relations among Washington, Ottawa and New Delhi. During his presidency, Mr. Biden has courted India’s leaders to counter the influence of Russia and China, despite growing concerns about India’s commitment to democracy. Mr. Modi, who has been in office since 2014, was re-elected as India’s prime minister in June, even as his Bharatiya Janata Party lost its majority in Parliament.",indian man pleaded guilty monday charge orchestrating failed assassination plot sikh separatist new york plan prosecutor say devised behalf unnamed official india government defendant nikhil gupta arrested czech republic year ago extradited last week make first appearance manhattan federal court accused trying arrange murder gurpatwant singh pannun american citizen lawyer new yorkbased sikh secessionist group murder attempt played backdrop doubt india commitment democracy spanned several country mirrored successful killing another separatist canada prosecutor say monday morning mr gupta entered lower manhattan courtroom blue cardigan yellow patterned shirt appeared relaxed spoke lawyer jeffrey chabrowe defense table held metropolitan detention center brooklyn since landing united state friday afternoon statement reporter arraignment mr chabrowe called case complex matter india united state background detail develop may cast government allegation entirely new light said mr gupta charged murder hire conspiracy commit murder hire convicted would face maximum year prison charge sent back detention center monday arraignment set appear court june statement monday attorney general merrick b garland said mr gupta face justice american courtroom extradition make clear justice department tolerate attempt silence harm american citizen said indictment unsealed november manhattan federal prosecutor described audacious plot began around may indian government employee enlisted mr gupta organize killing mr pannun living new york time mr pannun general counsel sikh justice organization support secession punjab state northern india vocal critic indian government banned country prosecutor say mr gupta lived india told government official involvement international narcotic weapon trafficking according indictment direction indian government employee mr gupta contacted man believed would help hire hit man new york fact agent american government agent introduced mr gupta undercover drug enforcement administration officer pretended hit man deal brokered mr gupta indian government official agreed pay dea officer kill mr pannun including cash advance job prosecutor said mr gupta shared personal information mr pannun undercover officer including mr pannuns address new york phone number indian official asked update mr gupta relayed surveillance photo mr pannun agent sent mr gupta instructed undercover officer carry assassination soon possible asked around time highlevel meeting u indian official according indictment prime minister narendra modi visited washington met president biden june prosecutor said june year gunman killed hardeep singh nijjar another sikh separatist leader british columbia canada mr nijjar knew mr pannun also outspoken critic indian government soon prosecutor said mr gupta told undercover officer mr nijjar also target many target mr gupta told officer pretend hit man need wait kill mr pannun prosecutor said monday mr pannun said statement full faith united state would hold mr gupta coconspirator accountable attempt life american soil blatant case india transnational terrorism challenging america sovereignty unequivocally prof modis india belief using violence suppress dissenting political opinion said spokesman indian embassy washington dc could immediately reached comment monday mr guptas case threatened complicate delicate relation among washington ottawa new delhi presidency mr biden courted india leader counter influence russia china despite growing concern india commitment democracy mr modi office since reelected india prime minister june even bharatiya janata party lost majority parliament
nytimes,Train Crash in India Leaves at Least 8 Dead and Dozens Injured,"June 17, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/world/asia/india-train-crash.html,"A freight train collided with a passenger train in eastern India on Monday, killing at least eight people and injuring 50 others, officials said. The episode occurred at around 9 a.m. when the Kanchanjunga Express, which was carrying passengers to the state of West Bengal from the state of Tripura, was leaving the Rangapani station. Four coaches of the popular and often-crowded passenger train derailed when it was rammed from behind by the commercial train. Images from the accident site showed one of the passenger coaches lifted off the railway track and balancing on a coach of the freight train. The death toll was likely to rise. Local news outlets, citing police officials, reported at least 15 people dead. The driver and the assistant driver of the freight train and a guard on the passenger train were among those killed. Jaya Varma Sinha, the chairperson of India’s railway board, said rescue operations were completed. Ashwini Vaishnaw, India’s railway minister, was en route to the site. The relatively low number of casualties could be attributed to the fact that the rear portion of the Kanchanjunga Express, which took the biggest impact from the collision, comprised cargo coaches and the guard’s coach. Passengers were in compartments far forward from the impact. While an investigation has been ordered to look into the cause of the collision, Ms. Sinha said human error such as disregarding a railway signal could have caused the crash. The accident again brings to the fore the issue of rail safety in a country whose millions of poor residents rely on railways for transport. India’s rail network is one of the world’s largest and is crucial to the country’s economy and its people’s lives and livelihood. The country has, in recent years, invested heavily on rail safety after a long history of deadly accidents. Although the overall number of rail accidents has lessened over the past decade, incidents with mass casualties have persisted. Last June, 290 people were killed when two passenger trains collided after one of them struck a stationary freight train at full speed and derailed in the state of Odisha. After that incident, opposition leaders demanded the resignation of Mr. Vaishnaw, the railway minister. He has said he was trying to expand a safety system, called Kavach, that is meant to prevent accidents when two trains are moving on the same track. Ms. Sinha said the technology had not yet been deployed on the route of the Kanchanjunga Express.",freight train collided passenger train eastern india monday killing least eight people injuring others official said episode occurred around kanchanjunga express carrying passenger state west bengal state tripura leaving rangapani station four coach popular oftencrowded passenger train derailed rammed behind commercial train image accident site showed one passenger coach lifted railway track balancing coach freight train death toll likely rise local news outlet citing police official reported least people dead driver assistant driver freight train guard passenger train among killed jaya varma sinha chairperson india railway board said rescue operation completed ashwini vaishnaw india railway minister en route site relatively low number casualty could attributed fact rear portion kanchanjunga express took biggest impact collision comprised cargo coach guard coach passenger compartment far forward impact investigation ordered look cause collision m sinha said human error disregarding railway signal could caused crash accident brings fore issue rail safety country whose million poor resident rely railway transport india rail network one world largest crucial country economy people life livelihood country recent year invested heavily rail safety long history deadly accident although overall number rail accident lessened past decade incident mass casualty persisted last june people killed two passenger train collided one struck stationary freight train full speed derailed state odisha incident opposition leader demanded resignation mr vaishnaw railway minister said trying expand safety system called kavach meant prevent accident two train moving track m sinha said technology yet deployed route kanchanjunga express
nytimes,"G7 Leaders, Expanding the Circle, Shift Focus to Migration and the South","June 14, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/world/europe/g7-summit-ai-china-india.html,"The Group of 7 countries threw open the doors of their club on Friday to India, Brazil, Turkey and other non-Western countries, acknowledging a shifting global landscape as they tried to enlist these nations’ leaders in causes ranging from climate change to managing the economic competition with China. While diplomats from the Group of 7 hammered out a communiqué that pledged support for Ukraine in its war against Russia and greater ambition in curbing carbon emissions, the focus was on Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and other leaders from outside the G7, whose support is increasingly critical to achieving any of these goals. Among the thorny questions on the second day of the summit: migration, which has helped fuel a recent resurgence of populism and far-right parties in Europe and the United States. The leaders also discussed the war in Gaza and China’s state subsidies of industries like electric vehicles, which has prompted the United States and the European Union to impose tariffs on Chinese exports. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, who is hosting the gathering, said the goal of her expanded guest list was to “strengthen dialogue with the nations of the Global South.” She insisted that the Group of 7 was “not a fortress closed in itself” but “an offer of values that we open to the world.” Ms. Meloni recruited Pope Francis to speak to the leaders about the dangers posed by artificial intelligence. Francis urged them to regulate the technology, of which he was himself a victim when A.I.-generated fake images of him clad in a white puffer jacket and a jewel-encrusted crucifix went viral last year. “The benefits and the damages it causes will depend on the way it is used,” the pope declared, warning of the risks of A.I.’s uncontrolled development. He called for lethal autonomous weapons, which are unmanned and uncontrolled by a human hand, to be banned, saying, “No machine should ever decide whether to take the life of a human being away.” The pope’s appearance was the emotional highlight of a day of carefully staged summitry that seemed to concede that the West is less dominant demographically and economically than in the past — and that it is listening to calls for more equity and balance in global decision-making. As Ms. Meloni guided the pope, in a wheelchair, around a circular table to meet the leaders, he was greeted by a visibly moved President Biden and got an enthusiastic hug from Argentina’s flamboyant president, Javier Milei, whose election last November was viewed as another sign of the rising tide of populism across the Americas and Europe. This is not the first time non-Western leaders have been invited to a Group of 7 meeting, but rarely have they been so conspicuous. In part that reflects the issues that Ms. Meloni has highlighted: Africa and the Mediterranean. The leaders of Algeria, Kenya and Tunisia were on hand at a luxury resort hotel on Italy’s southern coast, as was President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. “Inviting key developing country leaders reflects the reality that confronting China and Russia requires the cooperation of more than the G7,” said Daniel M. Price, who was a top trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “And Brazil, India and Turkey are as concerned about Chinese predatory trade practices and overcapacity as are Japan, Europe and the U.S.” The final G7 communiqué voiced concern about what the leaders called China’s “persistent industrial targeting and comprehensive nonmarket policies and practices that are leading to global spillovers, market distortions and harmful overcapacity.” The communiqué endorsed Mr. Biden’s effort to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. France and Canada had pushed for stronger language on Israel’s conduct of the war, according to people familiar with the negotiations, but the United States and Germany resisted. In a victory for Ms. Meloni, a conservative who opposes abortion, the communiqué did not include an explicit reference to abortion, in a passage that pledged to promote “comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.” A communiqué released by the Group of 7 leaders after their last summit in Hiroshima, Japan, referred specifically to abortion rights. The issue injected a briefly discordant note into the gathering after President Emmanuel Macron of France told an Italian journalist that some politicians did not share France’s “vision of equality between women and men.” Ms. Meloni criticized Mr. Macron, who recently called a snap parliamentary election, as seeking to politicize the issue at a “precious forum like the G7.” For the most part, however, the meeting underscored harmony among the leaders, many of whom are embattled by their own domestic politics. It also served as a platform for Ms. Meloni, 47, who has overcome initial qualms about her political roots in a party built on the ashes of fascism to win respect for her steadfast support of Ukraine. Presiding over the two days of meetings, she was able to put a spotlight on several of her pet issues. How to control migration has vexed the United States and Europe, compounded by the effects of climate change and warfare in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Ukraine. It is a particularly delicate issue for Ms. Meloni, who has campaigned hard to fight what she has called “uncontrolled immigration” to Italy and other parts of Europe from Africa and the Middle East. While Europe has welcomed thousands of Ukrainians, especially women and children, fleeing the Russian invasion, Ukrainian officials have urged European countries to help them repatriate men of fighting age. “Turkey is a critical player on global migration,” said Peter Westmacott, who served as Britain’s ambassador to Turkey, France and the United States. He noted that there are about three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds and Afghans. “If Europe wants to control migration from these countries,” Mr. Westmacott said, “Turkey is an indispensable partner.” Mr. Erdogan, he said, could also yet play a role in brokering an end to Ukraine’s war with Russia. As a Black Sea power, Turkey has kept open its commercial and political links to Russia. But it is also a NATO member and has supplied cheap, highly effective drones to help the Ukrainian resistance. Some of the invitations reflected diplomatic protocol, according to Italian officials. Brazil, India and South Africa were automatically included as current or future presidents of the Group of 20 industrialized nations. Argentina was invited, these officials said, because Mr. Milei has recognized the connections and interdependence between East and West. He and Ms. Meloni have also cultivated close personal ties, sharing a right-wing populism that includes opposition to abortion and gay rights.",group country threw open door club friday india brazil turkey nonwestern country acknowledging shifting global landscape tried enlist nation leader cause ranging climate change managing economic competition china diplomat group hammered communiqu pledged support ukraine war russia greater ambition curbing carbon emission focus prime minister narendra modi india president luiz incio lula da silva brazil leader outside g whose support increasingly critical achieving goal among thorny question second day summit migration helped fuel recent resurgence populism farright party europe united state leader also discussed war gaza china state subsidy industry like electric vehicle prompted united state european union impose tariff chinese export prime minister giorgia meloni italy hosting gathering said goal expanded guest list strengthen dialogue nation global south insisted group fortress closed offer value open world m meloni recruited pope francis speak leader danger posed artificial intelligence francis urged regulate technology victim aigenerated fake image clad white puffer jacket jewelencrusted crucifix went viral last year benefit damage cause depend way used pope declared warning risk ai uncontrolled development called lethal autonomous weapon unmanned uncontrolled human hand banned saying machine ever decide whether take life human away pope appearance emotional highlight day carefully staged summitry seemed concede west le dominant demographically economically past listening call equity balance global decisionmaking m meloni guided pope wheelchair around circular table meet leader greeted visibly moved president biden got enthusiastic hug argentina flamboyant president javier milei whose election last november viewed another sign rising tide populism across america europe first time nonwestern leader invited group meeting rarely conspicuous part reflects issue m meloni highlighted africa mediterranean leader algeria kenya tunisia hand luxury resort hotel italy southern coast president recep tayyip erdogan turkey inviting key developing country leader reflects reality confronting china russia requires cooperation g said daniel price top trade adviser president george w bush brazil india turkey concerned chinese predatory trade practice overcapacity japan europe u final g communiqu voiced concern leader called china persistent industrial targeting comprehensive nonmarket policy practice leading global spillover market distortion harmful overcapacity communiqu endorsed mr bidens effort broker ceasefire israel hamas gaza france canada pushed stronger language israel conduct war according people familiar negotiation united state germany resisted victory m meloni conservative opposes abortion communiqu include explicit reference abortion passage pledged promote comprehensive sexual reproductive health right communiqu released group leader last summit hiroshima japan referred specifically abortion right issue injected briefly discordant note gathering president emmanuel macron france told italian journalist politician share france vision equality woman men m meloni criticized mr macron recently called snap parliamentary election seeking politicize issue precious forum like g part however meeting underscored harmony among leader many embattled domestic politics also served platform m meloni overcome initial qualm political root party built ash fascism win respect steadfast support ukraine presiding two day meeting able put spotlight several pet issue control migration vexed united state europe compounded effect climate change warfare afghanistan middle east ukraine particularly delicate issue m meloni campaigned hard fight called uncontrolled immigration italy part europe africa middle east europe welcomed thousand ukrainian especially woman child fleeing russian invasion ukrainian official urged european country help repatriate men fighting age turkey critical player global migration said peter westmacott served britain ambassador turkey france united state noted three million syrian refugee turkey well hundred thousand iraqi kurd afghan europe want control migration country mr westmacott said turkey indispensable partner mr erdogan said could also yet play role brokering end ukraine war russia black sea power turkey kept open commercial political link russia also nato member supplied cheap highly effective drone help ukrainian resistance invitation reflected diplomatic protocol according italian official brazil india south africa automatically included current future president group industrialized nation argentina invited official said mr milei recognized connection interdependence east west m meloni also cultivated close personal tie sharing rightwing populism includes opposition abortion gay right
nytimes,Fire in Kuwait Worker Housing Leaves at Least 49 Dead,"June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/world/middleeast/fire-kuwait-migrant-worker-housing.html,"At least 49 people were killed and dozens of others injured in the Persian Gulf country of Kuwait, the state news agency said, when a fire broke out on Wednesday in a building that housed scores of low-income workers, many of them Indian nationals. The fire began during the morning in a coastal area called Mangaf, about half an hour’s drive from the center of the capital, Kuwait City. The Kuwaiti authorities have held the building owner for questioning as they investigate the cause of the fire and try to determine whether “any shortcoming or neglect” played a role, the state news agency reported. The authorities promised to begin a campaign to tackle building code violations. The public prosecutor’s office also planned to inspect the site and interview survivors. Speaking to journalists at the site of the fire, Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Al Sabah — Kuwait’s deputy prime minister and interior minister — blamed “the greed of property owners” for the disaster and said that the owner of the company employing the workers would also be detained, the Reuters news agency and Kuwaiti newspapers reported. Jayashankar, an Indian salesman who survived the fire, said that he awoke to screams around 4 a.m. local time. He and his roommates opened the door to their fourth-floor apartment and found that thick black smoke had enveloped the corridor, burning their lungs, he said in a phone interview, asking to be identified by his first name only for fear of retribution. Instead of trying to escape, he said, they locked the door, opened a window and waited for help. Two of his roommates who left the apartment to find an exit later died, he said. Witnesses told local news outlets that the fire had begun at the bottom of the seven-story building, sending smoke billowing upward. In a televised interview, an official in Kuwait’s firefighting force, Col. Sayed Hassan Al-Moussawi, said, “In a building like this, you’re supposed to go up to the roof, but unfortunately the door to the roof was locked.” Ramesh, an Indian worker who lives in a building next door and who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said in an interview that he saw people trying to jump out of windows to escape. The fire’s high death toll highlighted the perils faced by low-income immigrants to Gulf countries, who often toil under exploitative contracts and live in overcrowded housing, with regulatory protections that are limited or poorly enforced. Foreigners make up about two-thirds of the population of Kuwait, an oil-rich nation with one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds. Many are low-paid workers from South Asian countries who perform jobs including construction, restaurant service and street cleaning. More than 50 people hurt during the fire were sent to hospitals around Kuwait, with injuries including burns, broken bones from jumping out of the building and carbon monoxide poisoning from smoke inhalation, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. Nine were in critical condition, it said. Many of the workers affected were from India, the country’s embassy in Kuwait said on social media. On Wednesday, India’s ambassador to Kuwait, Adarsh Swaika, visited several hospitals where workers were taken, the embassy said in its posts. In a post on X, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India said that the fire was “saddening” and that the Indian Embassy would monitor the situation closely and work with the authorities “to assist the affected.” In a video published by the Kuwaiti news media, Sheikh Fahad was shown at the location of the fire, questioning an unidentified man about who lived in the building. The man told him that 196 people had lived there. The video cut off after Sheikh Fahad told the authorities to detain the man for questioning. Officials working in the municipality overseeing the area were also suspended from work pending an investigation, Kuwait’s state news agency reported. Building codes in Gulf countries are often laxly put in place, and smoke detectors and fire escapes are not common in residential properties. At the site of the fire on Wednesday afternoon, municipal employees were already putting up notices of violations on nearby buildings, including for partitioning rooms with gypsum board. Mangaf is predominantly inhabited by migrant workers, with apartment blocks housing men from India, Bangladesh and Egypt. Interviewed by The New York Times near the fire location, workers who lived nearby gave varying accounts of the numbers of men typically housed in each room, ranging from three to 12. Jayashankar, the survivor, said that nine people, all Indians, had shared his three-bedroom apartment. The building bore a sign saying it was a workers’ camp for a company called NBTC Group, a contracting firm headquartered in Kuwait with business in construction, industry, logistics and related fields. Phone calls to the company on Wednesday went unanswered, and an employee at the company’s offices said that staff members had been detained by officials that day. Another Indian worker who lived on the second floor of the building said that he and his roommates had survived because they had been out working an overnight shift. The worker, Sami, 45, who also asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution, said he had not yet been able to go inside to retrieve his belongings and inspect the damage because the police had closed off entrances to the building. Shahrukh Kha, who is from Bihar, India, said that he had spent all day trying to reach his brother, Kalu, who lived in the building, but that his brother’s phone was off. “We have not gotten any kind of information about whether he is injured or dead,” he said in a phone interview. Kalu Kha, a 30-year-old salesman who works in a fruit and vegetable shop, had been planning to travel home to India next month, his brother said; his wedding date is set for July 22.",least people killed dozen others injured persian gulf country kuwait state news agency said fire broke wednesday building housed score lowincome worker many indian national fire began morning coastal area called mangaf half hour drive center capital kuwait city kuwaiti authority held building owner questioning investigate cause fire try determine whether shortcoming neglect played role state news agency reported authority promised begin campaign tackle building code violation public prosecutor office also planned inspect site interview survivor speaking journalist site fire sheikh fahad yusuf al sabah kuwait deputy prime minister interior minister blamed greed property owner disaster said owner company employing worker would also detained reuters news agency kuwaiti newspaper reported jayashankar indian salesman survived fire said awoke scream around local time roommate opened door fourthfloor apartment found thick black smoke enveloped corridor burning lung said phone interview asking identified first name fear retribution instead trying escape said locked door opened window waited help two roommate left apartment find exit later died said witness told local news outlet fire begun bottom sevenstory building sending smoke billowing upward televised interview official kuwait firefighting force col sayed hassan almoussawi said building like youre supposed go roof unfortunately door roof locked ramesh indian worker life building next door also asked identified first name fear retribution said interview saw people trying jump window escape fire high death toll highlighted peril faced lowincome immigrant gulf country often toil exploitative contract live overcrowded housing regulatory protection limited poorly enforced foreigner make twothirds population kuwait oilrich nation one world largest sovereign wealth fund many lowpaid worker south asian country perform job including construction restaurant service street cleaning people hurt fire sent hospital around kuwait injury including burn broken bone jumping building carbon monoxide poisoning smoke inhalation ministry health said statement nine critical condition said many worker affected india country embassy kuwait said social medium wednesday india ambassador kuwait adarsh swaika visited several hospital worker taken embassy said post post x prime minister narendra modi india said fire saddening indian embassy would monitor situation closely work authority assist affected video published kuwaiti news medium sheikh fahad shown location fire questioning unidentified man lived building man told people lived video cut sheikh fahad told authority detain man questioning official working municipality overseeing area also suspended work pending investigation kuwait state news agency reported building code gulf country often laxly put place smoke detector fire escape common residential property site fire wednesday afternoon municipal employee already putting notice violation nearby building including partitioning room gypsum board mangaf predominantly inhabited migrant worker apartment block housing men india bangladesh egypt interviewed new york time near fire location worker lived nearby gave varying account number men typically housed room ranging three jayashankar survivor said nine people indian shared threebedroom apartment building bore sign saying worker camp company called nbtc group contracting firm headquartered kuwait business construction industry logistics related field phone call company wednesday went unanswered employee company office said staff member detained official day another indian worker lived second floor building said roommate survived working overnight shift worker sami also asked identified first name fear retribution said yet able go inside retrieve belonging inspect damage police closed entrance building shahrukh kha bihar india said spent day trying reach brother kalu lived building brother phone gotten kind information whether injured dead said phone interview kalu kha yearold salesman work fruit vegetable shop planning travel home india next month brother said wedding date set july
nytimes,"At the Ambani Wedding Celebrations, a Dazzling Display of Jewels","June 12, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/fashion/weddings/ambani-jewels.html,"When Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India abruptly changed her country’s constitution in 1971 and abolished the Privy Purse, a government allowance for the country’s former princely rulers, she also moved to nationalize their storied treasuries. Among the maharajahs, nizams and nabobs that once ruled the subcontinent, this set off a frenzy as they scurried to bury the family jewels. For centuries, the rarity, scale and grandeur of Indian jewels was so great that many became iconic objects. Take the Patiala Necklace, a tiered ornament resembling draperies of gems. Designed by Cartier, it featured an astounding 2,930 diamonds and centered on a single rock the size of a walnut. Or consider the Indore Pears, two stupendous and closely matched diamonds owned by Maharajah Yeshwant Rao Holkar II, a glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom was in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Indian princely patronage long set a global standard of splendor for both artistry and ostentation in the jewel trade. Yet in the decades after the Privy Purse, most of the big rocks seemed to have vanished underground. Legend has it that members of formerly royal families stashed their jewels in Swiss vaults, pawned them on the black market or hid them in flower pots. Bling on a royal scale largely disappeared. Or so it seemed until a fresh cadre of princes heaved into view: oligarchs. The richest of these by orders of magnitude is Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of his family’s megacompany Reliance Industries. Mr. Ambani’s personal fortune is estimated by Forbes at a staggering $115 billion. Despite his vast wealth, few outside India had heard of him — that is, until March 1, when he hosted a three-day party to celebrate his son Anant’s wedding in July. Everything about the prewedding affair was on a princely scale: the guest list of 1,000, including boldface names like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump; a glass palace specially constructed in the Ambani’s hometown, Jamnagar, in the western state of Gujarat; and Rihanna’s first public performance in years. Rihanna’s reported $6 million payday hogged the headlines, but what lit up at least one obsessive corner of the internet was the Ambani jewelry. This included necklaces and earrings and rings and hair ornaments of a size and grandeur seldom seen publicly since the days of the Raj. “It was almost like the time of maharajahs 100 years down the line,” said Pramod Kumar, an archivist and a founder of the museum consultancy EKA. He is also keeper of topophilia.india, an erudite Instagram account that is catnip for Indophile aesthetes. Mr. Kumar’s sleuth work traced a possible source of the two most gobsmacking gems seen at the Ambani prewedding celebration: massive step-cut Colombian emeralds roughly the size of Popsicles. Draped one below the other as pendants to a diamond necklace, they were worn one evening by the bridegroom’s mother, Nita Ambani. The bigger one was “of 562 carats,” Mr. Kumar wrote in an Instagram post, adding that the weight of the smaller stone was a mere 303 carats. Whatever their source, those emeralds were just two among many gems on display throughout an event at which the jewels often had greater star power than their wearers. “That emerald necklace was what caught everyone’s attention at first, but it was all almost unfathomable,” said Stellene Volandes, the editor in chief of Town & Country. She noted the scarcity represented by ropes of the rarest natural pearls from the Arabian Sea; necklaces in the heavy, ornate rani haar style studded with diamonds; and headpieces known as maang tikka, made with deep green emeralds from the storied Muzo mines. “You’d be very hard-pressed to find comparables for the sheer size and horsepower” of the jewels at the Ambani prewedding party, said Nico Landrigan, the president of the Verdura jewelry house in New York. “The Indians are a jewelry-obsessed culture in a category all their own. So you can only imagine what the actual wedding will bring out.” Before the wedding, scheduled for July 12 to 14 in Mumbai, there was yet another lavish preparatory celebration and opportunity to flaunt big rocks — a cruise from the Tyrrhenian Sea in Palermo, Italy, to the Mediterranean in Cannes, France, on an ocean liner whose 2,400 staterooms had been retrofitted for the Ambanis as three-bedroom suites for 800 invited guests. “Basically, what the Ambanis are doing is displaying a kind of old-style Hollywood glam,” said Mr. Kumar of EKA. “You don’t see that with any other current billionaire moguls in Europe or America, at least not in the public realm.” For Daniela Mascetti, the former chairwoman of Sotheby’s jewelry division in Europe and an author of “Understanding Jewelry,” a bible of the trade, the group more aptly compared to the Ambanis is the robber barons of the Industrial Age. “You have to look back to Vanderbilt or Gould, who also wanted big door-stoppers,” Ms. Mascetti said from London. “Let’s put it in a nice way,” she added. “If you are new money and you want to display wealth, you go big.” Yet it is not altogether that simple. Certain Ambani jewels were crafted using the whopper stones, but that is not to suggest that the determining factor in commissioning them was size. “There is tremendous artistry in the work,” said Ms. Volandes of Town & Country. Much of the Ambani jewels were designed by Viren Bhagat, among the more refined high jewelers, though also an assiduously private one. More than the size of individual stones like the stepped-cut emeralds, few save a detective like Mr. Kumar could predict their origins. “Being one-off is of the greatest importance in that world,” Francesca Amfitheatrof, the creative director of high jewelry and watches at Louis Vuitton, said recently from St.-Tropez, France, where she was debuting her latest collection. “To be able to source things that are so unique and outstanding, honestly, only an emperor has that possibility anymore,” she said. “It’s completely maharajah-like. It’s imperial.”",prime minister indira gandhi india abruptly changed country constitution abolished privy purse government allowance country former princely ruler also moved nationalize storied treasury among maharajah nizams nabob ruled subcontinent set frenzy scurried bury family jewel century rarity scale grandeur indian jewel great many became iconic object take patiala necklace tiered ornament resembling drapery gem designed cartier featured astounding diamond centered single rock size walnut consider indore pear two stupendous closely matched diamond owned maharajah yeshwant rao holkar ii glamorous westernized ruler whose kingdom central indian state madhya pradesh indian princely patronage long set global standard splendor artistry ostentation jewel trade yet decade privy purse big rock seemed vanished underground legend member formerly royal family stashed jewel swiss vault pawned black market hid flower pot bling royal scale largely disappeared seemed fresh cadre prince heaved view oligarch richest order magnitude mukesh ambani chairman family megacompany reliance industry mr ambanis personal fortune estimated forbes staggering billion despite vast wealth outside india heard march hosted threeday party celebrate son anants wedding july everything prewedding affair princely scale guest list including boldface name like mark zuckerberg bill gate ivanka trump glass palace specially constructed ambanis hometown jamnagar western state gujarat rihannas first public performance year rihannas reported million payday hogged headline lit least one obsessive corner internet ambani jewelry included necklace earring ring hair ornament size grandeur seldom seen publicly since day raj almost like time maharajah year line said pramod kumar archivist founder museum consultancy eka also keeper topophiliaindia erudite instagram account catnip indophile aesthete mr kumars sleuth work traced possible source two gobsmacking gem seen ambani prewedding celebration massive stepcut colombian emerald roughly size popsicle draped one pendant diamond necklace worn one evening bridegroom mother nita ambani bigger one carat mr kumar wrote instagram post adding weight smaller stone mere carat whatever source emerald two among many gem display throughout event jewel often greater star power wearer emerald necklace caught everyones attention first almost unfathomable said stellene volandes editor chief town country noted scarcity represented rope rarest natural pearl arabian sea necklace heavy ornate rani haar style studded diamond headpiece known maang tikka made deep green emerald storied muzo mine youd hardpressed find comparables sheer size horsepower jewel ambani prewedding party said nico landrigan president verdura jewelry house new york indian jewelryobsessed culture category imagine actual wedding bring wedding scheduled july mumbai yet another lavish preparatory celebration opportunity flaunt big rock cruise tyrrhenian sea palermo italy mediterranean cannes france ocean liner whose stateroom retrofitted ambanis threebedroom suite invited guest basically ambanis displaying kind oldstyle hollywood glam said mr kumar eka dont see current billionaire mogul europe america least public realm daniela mascetti former chairwoman sothebys jewelry division europe author understanding jewelry bible trade group aptly compared ambanis robber baron industrial age look back vanderbilt gould also wanted big doorstopper m mascetti said london let put nice way added new money want display wealth go big yet altogether simple certain ambani jewel crafted using whopper stone suggest determining factor commissioning size tremendous artistry work said m volandes town country much ambani jewel designed viren bhagat among refined high jeweler though also assiduously private one size individual stone like steppedcut emerald save detective like mr kumar could predict origin oneoff greatest importance world francesca amfitheatrof creative director high jewelry watch louis vuitton said recently sttropez france debuting latest collection able source thing unique outstanding honestly emperor possibility anymore said completely maharajahlike imperial

nytimes,"India-Pakistan Cricket World Cup Match Brings 34,000 Fans to Long Island","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/nyregion/india-pakistan-cricket-world-cup.html,"Normally at this time of year, the grassy southeastern corner of Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, N.Y., is a place for softball games, family picnics and a few cricket players enjoying a warm weekend afternoon. On Sunday, that space was transformed into a stage for one of the most-watched global sporting events of the year. More than 34,000 fans and cricket dignitaries squeezed into a temporary stadium built in the last three months in the Long Island park to watch the most anticipated match of the T20 Cricket World Cup: India versus Pakistan. For about three hours, fans in blue and orange India shirts mingled with their (vastly outnumbered) rivals in the dark green of Pakistan, producing a festive and vibrant atmosphere. They roared at every big play, shouting and waving signs and flags. They ate South Asian food sold at the concession stands, jumped, chanted, high-fived with fellow supporters and — after a bit of rain — soaked up the sunshine on a historic day at the usually quiet park. “It was electric,” said Chandu Talla, an India fan and entrepreneur from Tampa, Fla., who came to the match with his son Aryan, a high school junior. “We paid $2,500 per ticket and no regrets,” he added. “It was a dream come true to see India here.” After a slow start, India came back strong to win, and when Pakistan’s Naseem Shah hit the last ball from India bowler Arshdeep Singh, the India fans erupted in cheers. “It was pretty good,” said India bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who was named the player of the match. “Always, when India and Pakistan play, a lot of emotion does come in. It did feel like we had a lot of support.” People in the New York area may have been mostly oblivious to it, but any match between India and Pakistan, two of the greatest cricketing nations, is a monumental event, at least in South Asia and other cricket-loving parts of the world. The previous time the teams played, last fall, viewership reached 398 million in India alone, according to the International Cricket Council. (This year’s Super Bowl had 123 million viewers.) Sunday’s attendance (34,028) constituted the largest at an international cricket match in the United States, according to the I.C.C. Attendees included such cricketing legends as Yuvraj Singh of India, Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi and Australia’s Ricky Ponting. For Omar Minaya, the Yankees’ special adviser and the former general manager of the Mets, the cricket match was his first. “It’s amazing,” he said. “The atmosphere is great. It’s like the World Baseball Classic, or the Dominican Baseball League.” The T20 World Cup, held every two years, is a 20-nation tournament featuring a shorter form of cricket. This year, for the first time, the event is being held in the United States and several Caribbean nations where cricket is revered. The U.S. matches are also being held in Dallas and Lauderhill, Fla., but New York was designated for the marquee matchup. Cricket is part of the cultural fabric in both India and Pakistan, but political tensions over the decades have forced the countries to play each other in other places. “Oh, it’s contentious, a real battle of sentiments,” said Narinder Kapoor, 84, a retired U.S. Treasury Department agent, originally from New Delhi. “When these countries play, it’s a real hot potato.” A former amateur cricket player who emigrated to Syosset, N.Y., in 1972, Mr. Kapoor had not seen a cricket match live since 1974, although he watches the sport constantly on TV. He went to the game between Ireland and Canada on Friday and had hoped to attend Sunday’s big encounter, but his knees were ailing him, so he stayed home, according to his son, Sandeep Kapoor. The elder Mr. Kapoor said that he enjoyed the sparsely attended match on Friday, but added that the temporary stadium did not have enough accommodations for people with disabilities and that it was difficult for older people to ascend the steps. “But once you are inside, the field and the view is excellent,” he said. “World class.” Security was tight for the match, especially after a website purportedly affiliated with the terrorist organization ISIS called for attacks on the event. Mounted police, SWAT units, sniffer dogs, helicopters and large numbers of police officers swarmed the area, and long lines formed at entrances as people went through security scanners. Bruce Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, said that the I.C.C. had defrayed some of the cost of the security, which he said included local, state and federal agencies, including the F.B.I. “I want to commend the fans,” Mr. Blakeman said, adding, “Everybody has been so polite and respectful, and they followed instructions so they could be safe and healthy.” There was at least one exception. An airplane trailing a sign that said “Release Imran Khan” breached restricted airspace over the stadium before the match. (Mr. Khan, a former Pakistani cricket star and former prime minister of Pakistan, is serving a prison sentence there.) Mr. Blakeman said the plane was eventually intercepted. The mood at the park was generally upbeat, even for Pakistan fans on the losing end. “India-Pakistan is a very big deal,” said Temu Martin, an airfreight transport official from New Jersey and a Pakistan supporter. “But it’s not war. It’s a game.” He said that after Pakistan lost to the United States last week in a major upset in Dallas, ticket prices for Sunday’s match in East Meadow plummeted from over $2,000 to $600. He said he was planning to travel to Barbados for Pakistan’s next match and then to attend a knockout-stage match in Antigua. There are three more matches scheduled in New York, with the final one on Wednesday between India and the United States. The stadium will then be dismantled and the pieces sent out to other sporting events around the country. Mr. Blakeman predicted that Nassau County would make $150 million on the eight New York games of the tournament — 10 times what the county spent on infrastructure, planning and security, he said. Cricket officials had told him that there could be as many as 600 million viewers worldwide for Sunday’s match, he added. He said that he had heard from investors who want to bring the sport, perhaps with New York’s franchise in Major League Cricket, to Nassau County. “The way things have gone here these last couple of weeks, I think cricket has found a home,” Mr. Blakeman said.",normally time year grassy southeastern corner eisenhower park east meadow ny place softball game family picnic cricket player enjoying warm weekend afternoon sunday space transformed stage one mostwatched global sporting event year fan cricket dignitary squeezed temporary stadium built last three month long island park watch anticipated match cricket world cup india versus pakistan three hour fan blue orange india shirt mingled vastly outnumbered rival dark green pakistan producing festive vibrant atmosphere roared every big play shouting waving sign flag ate south asian food sold concession stand jumped chanted highfived fellow supporter bit rain soaked sunshine historic day usually quiet park electric said chandu talla india fan entrepreneur tampa fla came match son aryan high school junior paid per ticket regret added dream come true see india slow start india came back strong win pakistan naseem shah hit last ball india bowler arshdeep singh india fan erupted cheer pretty good said india bowler jasprit bumrah named player match always india pakistan play lot emotion come feel like lot support people new york area may mostly oblivious match india pakistan two greatest cricketing nation monumental event least south asia cricketloving part world previous time team played last fall viewership reached million india alone according international cricket council year super bowl million viewer sunday attendance constituted largest international cricket match united state according icc attendee included cricketing legend yuvraj singh india pakistan shahid afridi australia ricky ponting omar minaya yankee special adviser former general manager mets cricket match first amazing said atmosphere great like world baseball classic dominican baseball league world cup held every two year nation tournament featuring shorter form cricket year first time event held united state several caribbean nation cricket revered u match also held dallas lauderhill fla new york designated marquee matchup cricket part cultural fabric india pakistan political tension decade forced country play place oh contentious real battle sentiment said narinder kapoor retired u treasury department agent originally new delhi country play real hot potato former amateur cricket player emigrated syosset ny mr kapoor seen cricket match live since although watch sport constantly tv went game ireland canada friday hoped attend sunday big encounter knee ailing stayed home according son sandeep kapoor elder mr kapoor said enjoyed sparsely attended match friday added temporary stadium enough accommodation people disability difficult older people ascend step inside field view excellent said world class security tight match especially website purportedly affiliated terrorist organization isi called attack event mounted police swat unit sniffer dog helicopter large number police officer swarmed area long line formed entrance people went security scanner bruce blakeman nassau county executive said icc defrayed cost security said included local state federal agency including fbi want commend fan mr blakeman said adding everybody polite respectful followed instruction could safe healthy least one exception airplane trailing sign said release imran khan breached restricted airspace stadium match mr khan former pakistani cricket star former prime minister pakistan serving prison sentence mr blakeman said plane eventually intercepted mood park generally upbeat even pakistan fan losing end indiapakistan big deal said temu martin airfreight transport official new jersey pakistan supporter war game said pakistan lost united state last week major upset dallas ticket price sunday match east meadow plummeted said planning travel barbados pakistan next match attend knockoutstage match antigua three match scheduled new york final one wednesday india united state stadium dismantled piece sent sporting event around country mr blakeman predicted nassau county would make million eight new york game tournament time county spent infrastructure planning security said cricket official told could many million viewer worldwide sunday match added said heard investor want bring sport perhaps new york franchise major league cricket nassau county way thing gone last couple week think cricket found home mr blakeman said
nytimes,"Modi, Striking a Modest Tone, Is Sworn In for a Third Term","June 9, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/world/asia/india-changed-modi-swearing-in.html,"As a humbled Narendra Modi was sworn in on Sunday for a third term as India’s prime minister, the political air in New Delhi appeared transformed. The election that ended last week stripped Mr. Modi of his parliamentary majority and forced him to turn to a diverse set of coalition partners to stay in power. Now, these other parties are enjoying something that for years was singularly Mr. Modi’s: relevance and the spotlight. Their leaders have been swarmed by TV crews while on their way to present demands and policy opinions to Mr. Modi. His opponents, too, have been getting more airtime, with stations cutting live to their news conferences, something almost unheard-of in recent years. Above all, the change can be seen in Mr. Modi himself. For now, at least, the messianic air is gone. He pitches himself as the modest administrator that voters showed they wanted. “To run the government, a majority is necessary. But to run the nation, a consensus is necessary,” Mr. Modi said in a speech on Friday to members of his coalition ahead of his swearing in. “The people want us to deliver better than before.” A visibly emotional Mr. Modi took the oath of office on Sunday evening, only the second prime minister to be elected for a third consecutive term in the seven decades of India’s republic. The ceremony, at the country’s presidential palace, was attended by about 8,000 supporters and dignitaries, including the leaders of India’s neighboring nations. To many, Mr. Modi’s shift in approach can mean only good things for the country’s democracy — a move toward moderation in a hugely diverse nation that was being whipped into a Hindu-first monolith in the image of one man. The question is whether Mr. Modi can truly become something he has not been during his two-plus decades in elected office: a consensus builder. “He is a pragmatic politician and, for his own survival and for the survival of his party, he will be a little mellowed,” said Ashutosh, a New Delhi-based analyst who uses only one name and is the author of a book on how Indian politics have changed under Mr. Modi. “But to assume a qualitative change in his style of governance is expecting too much.” A trademark of Mr. Modi’s leadership in recent years has been the use of power levers at his disposal — from pressure of police cases to the lure of a share in power and its perks — to break his opponents and get them to switch to his side. A bruised governing party may well try such tactics to peel away some lawmakers to his side, analyst say, to buttress his place at the top. But in the days leading up to the swearing-in, a change in approach was evident. When members of the new coalition packed into the hall of India’s old Parliament building on Friday for deliberations on forming the government, every time a senior ally seated next to him stood up to start his speech, Mr. Modi also stood up. When it was time for Mr. Modi to be garlanded as the coalition’s choice for prime minister, he waited for the leaders of the two main coalition partners to arrive by his side before the congratulatory wreath of purple orchids was placed around his neck. His hourlong address contained none of his usual references to himself in the third person. His tone was measured. He focused on the coalition’s promise of “good governance” and “the dream of a developed India,” and he acknowledged that things would be different from the past 10 years. The last time Mr. Modi came to the Parliament complex for a closely watched event, last May when he inaugurated a new, more modern building for the assembly, he made an entrance some observers compared with that of a king: with markings on his forehead as a sign of piety and a scepter in his hand, as shirtless, chanting Hindu monks walked ahead of and behind him. This time, he went straight to a copy of the Constitution, which declares that India is a secular and socialist democracy, bowing before it and lifting it to his forehead. For the first time in his more than two decades in elected office, Mr. Modi finds himself in uncharted territory. Until now, as long as he has been at the helm — whether at the state level as the chief minister of Gujarat or at the national level — his Bharatiya Janata Party has always had a majority. Analysts say that history of never having been in the opposition has shaped his heavy-handed approach to politics. When he left Gujarat, after 13 years, he had established such a firm grip and had so routed the opposition that the state had effectively become one of single-party rule. His first national victory in 2014, with a majority for his B.J.P., ended decades of coalition governance in India, in which no party had been able to capture the 272 seats in Parliament necessary for a majority. In 2019, he was re-elected with an even bigger majority. Mr. Modi’s enormous power helped swiftly carry out what had for decades been his right-wing party’s agenda, including construction of a lavish Hindu temple on a long-disputed site that once held a mosque, and the revocation of the special status long enjoyed by the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir. A separatist insurgency has long troubled the Himalayan Kashmir region. As the inauguration ceremony began in New Delhi on Sunday, a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims in the Reasi district fell into a gorge after gunmen opened fire on it. At least eight people were killed, the police said. A trademark of Mr. Modi’s governance was a disregard for parliamentary procedures and for debates on legislation. His unexpected, overnight demonetization in 2016 — which invalidated India’s currency in an effort to crack down on corruption — threw the country into chaos and dealt a blow to a still cash-driven economy. Similarly, rushing to enact laws aimed at overhauling the agriculture market resulted in a year of protests that choked Delhi, forcing Mr. Modi to retreat. Before the election results came out, Mr. Modi’s party had predicted that his coalition would win 400 seats in India’s 543-seat Parliament. The opposition would be reduced to sitting “in the spectators’ gallery,” Mr. Modi said. Officials in his government had made clear that in his new term he would seek to put in place the only main item remaining on his party’s agenda: legislating a “uniform civil code” across this diverse country to replace varying laws of different religions that currently govern issues like marriage and inheritance. His party leaders spoke of Mr. Modi not only as their leader for the current term, but also for the next election in 2029, when he would be 78. “He has been trying to transform the country,” Sudesh Verma, a B.J.P. official who wrote a book on Mr. Modi’s rise, said in an interview before the election results were announced. “I look forward to him working like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, who worked into his 90s.” But under a coalition government, Mr. Modi’s traditional approach will be difficult. Two of the main coalition parties that helped him achieve the minimum number of Parliament seats to form a government are secular, in contrast to Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist ideology. N. Chandrababu Naidu, whose party holds 16 seats, has been scathing in the past in his criticism of Mr. Modi’s treatment of the Muslim minority. He has also openly criticized Mr. Modi for using the central investigating agencies to target his opponents and taking “steps to subvert all democratic institutions.” Neerja Chowdhury, a political analyst in Delhi and the author of the 2023 book “How Prime Ministers Decide,” said, “The contentious ideological issues, like the enactment of the uniform civil code, may be put on the back burner if the allies are not comfortable with it.” Mr. Modi’s popular image is built on two strong pillars. He is a champion of economic development, with an inspiring biography of a rise from a humble caste and relative poverty. He is also a lifelong Hindu nationalist, with decades as a foot soldier in a movement seeking to turn India’s secular and diverse state into an overtly Hindu-first place. At the peak of his power, the Hindu nationalist aspect increasingly dominated. Analysts say that the recent rebuke by voters might be a lucky break for the nation: prompting Mr. Modi to tap into his development champion side, and to focus on a legacy of economic transformation that could improve the lives of all Indians.",humbled narendra modi sworn sunday third term india prime minister political air new delhi appeared transformed election ended last week stripped mr modi

nytimes,"India’s Modi, Humbled by Voters, Faces Potent Economic Struggles","June 7, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/business/india-election-modi-economy.html,"Before the Indian election results emerged this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was widely viewed as a charismatic and popular strongman celebrated by the business world for elevating its importance, even as he failed to solve a vexing problem: how to turn swift economic growth into critically needed jobs. After the election, Mr. Modi finds himself staring at that same monumental puzzle, yet relegated to an uncomfortable new status. He is the head of a party that has been chastened at the polls, forcing him to forge a coalition to maintain power. Mr. Modi’s governing authority is likely to be constrained by the complexities of keeping his coalition partners on his side. He could not solve India’s most deep-seated economic challenge when he wielded a monopolistic hold on power. Now, he is a weakened leader who must balance additional interests, while still lacking an obvious way to improve living standards. “There has been a sense that employment growth has been weak in the last four, five years,” said Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic adviser to the Modi administration, who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “How do you create more jobs? This is really India’s central economic challenge, but I think the government will find itself with relatively limited tools.” The humbling of Mr. Modi’s party resonates in part as an expression of popular frustration that India remains a land of economic peril for hundreds of millions of people, as well as a country defined by astonishing contrasts in wealth. In major cities, five-star hotels boasting sumptuous spas look down on teeming slums that lack plumbing. In rural areas, malnutrition prevails under many roofs, and families struggle to find the money to keep children in school. Though its working-age population numbers roughly one billion, India has only 430 million jobs, according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, an independent research institution in Mumbai. And most of those counted as employed are stuck in precarious circumstances as day laborers and farm hands, lacking reliable wages and government workplace protections. Improved livelihoods are evident in many cities, from the high-rise apartments filling out the horizons to air-conditioned shopping malls and luxury cars choking roads. But the gains are narrowly concentrated. Professionals who work in technology centers in the south of the country and around the capital of New Delhi have enjoyed substantial progress. A rapidly growing domestic auto industry is a source of relatively high-paying jobs. Magnates like Gautam Adani, one of Asia’s richest men, have seen their business empires enhanced by their relationships with Mr. Modi and his willingness to eviscerate regulatory impediments to their greater fortune. But most Indian workers are effectively marooned in the so-called informal sector — laboring at roadside stalls, in small shops and in itinerant trades where they have no guarantee of income or the possibility of advancement. The failure of economic growth to yield more jobs is in large part the story of how India missed out on the manufacturing boom that played out in East Asia over recent decades. From South Korea and China to Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, hundreds of millions of people have escaped poverty via wages earned in factories. India has not shared in that transformation in large part because of a historical focus on self-sufficiency, a disdain for international trade and stultifying bureaucracy that has discouraged investment. “The whole manufacturing thing bypassed India,” Mr. Subramanian, the economist, said. “It’s that bigger development failure that is continuing to haunt India.” Mr. Modi has pursued initiatives aimed at bolstering manufacturing and increasing exports. His administration has streamlined regulations and improved ports. Yet despite some high-profile developments like Apple moving the assembly of some iPhones to India, manufacturing makes up only 13 percent of the country’s economy, according to World Bank data. That is a lower share than a decade ago, when Mr. Modi took office. Foreign money has flowed into India’s stock markets, multiplying share prices, a key element of Mr. Modi’s pro-business image. But persuading international investors to put money directly into Indian companies — a riskier bet — has been a harder sell. His Hindu nationalist party has demonized the Muslim minority, a source of social ferment that has raised fears of instability. The election could further discourage additional investment, because Mr. Modi will likely have a more difficult time gaining passage of stalled reforms sought by business, including laws making it easier to amass land and hire and fire workers. With no clear pathway toward economic dynamism and more challenging political circumstances, Mr. Modi might resort to a time-honored method of shoring up support: He will expand social welfare programs, tapping government coffers to hand out more cash to communities in need. Such a course could potentially diminish available funding for the advancement of the government’s signature program — its aggressive construction of highways, ports, airports and other infrastructure. Those plans are central to maintaining India’s strong economic growth and the broader campaign to encourage investment in manufacturing. Some fear that any short-term pursuit of political favor through the scattering of money could undermine the longer-term project of spurring jobs through the promotion of industry. “You need to ensure that the benefits of economic development reach the maximum number of people,” said Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at Global Data.TS Lombard, a forecasting and consulting firm in London. “If people keep depending on welfare and are not getting the benefits of economic development, then it basically just creates stagnation.” Geopolitical alterations appear to give India a fresh crack at growing its manufacturing base. As the United States and China engage in trade hostilities, multinational brands are seeking to reduce their heavy dependence on Chinese factories to make their goods. Major retailers like Walmart are increasingly looking to India as an alternative to China. But capturing that potential investment demands continued upgrading of highways, rail connections and ports, along with a focus on vocational training to give people the needed skills to take up factory work. Even before the election, there were doubts that Mr. Modi’s administration was moving quickly enough to realize these gains. “India is a counterweight to China in terms of geopolitics, and we will continue to see some of that investment flowing,” Ms. Deveshwar said. “But the scale at which they are provisioning the ecosystem for these opportunities just is not large enough.”",indian election

nytimes,The World Heads to the Polls,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/climate/global-elections-climate-change-policy.html,"One of the busiest election cycles in history is coming to an end on Sunday. Hundreds of millions of people have gone to the polls in South Africa, India and Mexico in recent days, and millions more will do the same in the European Union this weekend. As Somini Sengupta has explained in a series of articles this week, among the issues that the new leaders of these countries will face: how to transition away from coal, how to adapt to record-breaking heat and, in Europe’s case, how to address a growing backlash against environmental policies. Today, I want to lay out some the most pressing environmental challenges in these areas, and what the results announced in the past few days point to. Keep in mind that whatever happens in the United States election in November will affect many of these countries, too. The biggest takeaway from India’s elections, as my colleagues who cover the country put it, is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “lost his aura of invincibility.” His Bharatiya Janata Party still won far more seats than any other party, and Modi is set to take up his third consecutive term as prime minister. But his party didn’t win an outright majority and now needs coalition partners to stay in power. Many critics of the current government see the result as good news for democracy, because Modi will be forced to seek support from more moderate allies. It could also bring some relief to activists like Ritwick Dutta, an environmental lawyer whose efforts to defend nature in India have made him a target of the government. But it’s unclear how fewer seats in Parliament will affect Modi’s environmental policies. The main challenges facing the next Indian government are what to do about the effects of climate change, including heat waves that have killed dozens of people. During the elections, at least 33 poll workers were among them, and the heat also closed schools in several states,",one busiest election cycle history coming end sunday hundred million people gone poll south africa india mexico recent day million european union weekend somini sengupta explained series article week among issue new leader country face transition away coal adapt recordbreaking heat europe case address growing backlash environmental policy today want lay pressing environmental challenge area result announced past day point keep mind whatever happens united state election november affect many country biggest takeaway india election colleague cover country put prime minister narendra modi lost aura invincibility bharatiya janata party still far seat party modi set take third consecutive term prime minister party didnt win outright majority need coalition partner stay power many critic current government see result good news democracy modi forced seek support moderate ally could also bring relief activist like ritwick dutta environmental lawyer whose effort defend nature india made target government unclear fewer seat parliament affect modis environmental policy main challenge facing next indian government effect climate change including heat wave killed dozen people election least poll worker among heat also closed school several state
nytimes,Narendra Modi’s India,"June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/briefing/modis-india.html,"Narendra Modi has just won re-election as India’s prime minister, though by a far narrower margin than expected. With his third consecutive term, the charismatic strongman has still sealed his position as the country’s most significant leader in generations. Despite having led India for a decade, Modi has in some ways kept his country guessing about his vision. On major issues — India’s relationships, its economy, its society and its government — it’s still unclear what sort of country Modi wants India to be. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain four of the big questions. India has spent recent years deepening its relationship with the United States. It has gotten closer to American allies, including Japan and Australia, and ordered high-end American weapons systems — the kind that create dependence down the road. And it is unlikely to side with China. In 2020, Chinese troops crossed into territory controlled by India and killed 20 soldiers in a skirmish. Modi has kept Beijing at arm’s length since then. But Modi, 73, has signaled that he doesn’t want to be a U.S. ally. Some officials in his inner circle still regard the United States warily. American diplomats complain about New Delhi’s apparent efforts to erode democratic norms and the rights of minority groups. So India keeps its options open. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States tried in vain to persuade India to take a stand against the war. India still processes Russian oil (picking up the slack created by international sanctions). It still buys weapons from Russia. India spent the Cold War trying to position itself as a nonaligned power. Old habits die hard. India recently overtook China as the most populous country and the fastest-growing large economy. Still, most of the country remains poor. Some 800 million people need help filling their stomachs. Modi’s ideas about how to help them can be contradictory — they’re both globally minded and protectionist.",narendra modi reelection india prime minister though far narrower margin expected third consecutive term charismatic strongman still sealed position country significant leader generation despite led india decade modi way kept country guessing vision major issue india relationship economy society government still unclear sort country modi want india today newsletter ill explain four big question india spent recent year deepening relationship united state gotten closer american ally including japan australia ordered highend american weapon system kind create dependence road unlikely side china chinese troop crossed territory controlled india killed soldier skirmish modi kept beijing arm length since modi signaled doesnt want u ally official inner circle still regard united state warily american diplomat complain new delhi apparent effort erode democratic norm right minority group india keep option open russia invaded ukraine united state tried vain persuade india take stand war india still process russian oil picking slack created international sanction still buy weapon russia india spent cold war trying position nonaligned power old habit die hard india recently overtook china populous country fastestgrowing large economy still country remains poor million people need help filling stomach modis idea help contradictory theyre globally minded protectionist
nytimes,"In Global Elections, Strongmen Are Taken Down a Notch","June 6, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/world/global-elections-india-turkey-democracy.html,"In India, a powerful leader wins another term but sees his party’s majority vanish. In South Africa, the governing party is humbled by voters for the first time since the end of apartheid. In Britain, a populist insurgent barges into an election that is shaping up to be a crushing defeat for the long-ruling Conservatives. If there is a common thread halfway through this global year of elections, it is a desire by voters to send a strong signal to the powers that be — if not quite a wholesale housecleaning, then a defiant shake-up of the status quo. Even in Mexico, where Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and the handpicked successor of the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was elected in a landslide last Sunday, voters were rewarding the forces that had uprooted the country’s entrenched establishment only six years earlier. With a billion-plus people going to the polls in more than 60 countries, some analysts had feared that 2024 would pose a fateful test for democracy — one that it might fail. For years, populist and strongmen leaders have chipped away at democratic institutions, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of elections, while social media has swamped voters with disinformation and conspiracy theories. In some of the biggest, most fragile democracies, leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey had been regarded as close to invincible, using appeals to nationalism or sectarianism to mobilize supporters and bending institutions to suit their purposes. Yet now, Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan have both had their wings clipped. Soaring inflation, chronic unemployment and uneven economic growth have widened inequality in India, Turkey and elsewhere, frustrating voters who have shown a willingness to buck the establishment. “We do have electoral systems that are producing outcomes the governing parties didn’t want,” said Ben Ansell, a professor of comparative democratic institutions at the University of Oxford. “They’ve all been destabilized by a tricky economic environment, and behaving like strongmen hasn’t saved them.” Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan remain in power, each now in his third term. But Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., lost dozens of seats and will have to govern in a coalition with two secular parties. Turkey’s opposition struck a blow against Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party in April, winning a string of local elections and solidifying its control of important cities like Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. “In a lot of countries where there’s been talk of backsliding, that’s where we’ve seen a bounce back,” Professor Ansell said. “For Modi and Erdogan, taking the sheen off their infallibility was very important.” With so many elections in so many countries, it is dangerous to generalize. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia rolled up 88 percent of the vote in a landslide re-election victory in March that spoke less to Russian public sentiment and more to the ability of an autocrat, facing no meaningful opposition, to stage-manage a show of support for his war in Ukraine. In Europe, far-right parties are expected to perform well in European Parliament elections, which began on Thursday. Analysts said they did not believe this would jeopardize the political center that has governed Europe in the post-World War II era. And Poland provided a source of reassurance last fall, when voters pushed out its nationalist Law and Justice Party in favor of a more liberal opposition. Still, the success of far-right figures like Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy, attests to the enduring appeal of populism. “Populists and right-wingers will continue to make gains and strike fear into the European political establishment,” the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said in its analysis of the top risks of 2024. Britain’s general election was shaken up on Monday when Nigel Farage, a populist politician, pro-Brexit campaigner and ally of former President Donald J. Trump, announced he would run for a seat in Parliament under the banner of his Reform U.K. party, which has a strident anti-immigration message. That will add to the headache for the Conservative Party, which has lagged the opposition Labour Party by double digits in polls for nearly 18 months. Reform, which is fielding candidates across the country, could siphon off Conservative votes among those who blame the party for a weak economy and rising immigration numbers since Britain left the European Union in 2020. Some critics argue that the Conservative Party’s problems stem from its free-market policies, which they say have disillusioned voters in disadvantaged parts of Britain and set it apart from right-wing parties in Europe or Mr. Trump’s Make America Great Again movement in the United States. More fundamentally, though, the Conservatives have been in power for 14 years, and they face the same pent-up dissatisfaction with the status quo that fueled the recent elections in India, South Africa and Turkey. In some countries, the urge to break with the past has led voters to make unorthodox choices: Javier Milei, a flamboyant libertarian economist, swept to power in Argentina last November with a promise to close its central bank and wage an all-out assault on what he described as a corrupt political “caste.” Some analysts argue that similarly disruptive forces are driving the presidential race in the United States, where a comparatively healthy economy and the advantages of incumbency have not spared President Biden, who faces a neck-and-neck challenge from Mr. Trump even after the former president was convicted of multiple felonies. “It’s not about left versus right, it’s about the status quo versus change,” said Frank Luntz, an American political strategist who has lived and worked in Britain. “You can’t buy a house in the U.K., the N.H.S. doesn’t work,” he said, referring to the National Health Service. “In the United States, you can’t afford housing or health care. It’s about broken promises, year after year after year.” That sense of betrayal is even more acute in countries like South Africa, where the African National Congress, or A.N.C., has governed since the start of democracy there in 1994, piling up majorities even as the economy and social infrastructure crumbled. Last week, voters finally rebelled, driving down the A.N.C.’s vote share to 40 percent, from 58 percent in the last national election in 2019. Among their biggest complaints is the lack of job opportunities: South Africa’s unemployment rate — at 42 percent, including those who have stopped looking for work — is one of the highest in the world. Stagnation has widened the country’s already profound inequality. South Africans flock to cities looking for work. But many end up in decrepit buildings and slapdash shack communities, often without running water or sanitary toilets. Regular power outages leave streets dark and residents of many communities vulnerable to crime. South Africa’s murder rate is six and a half times as high as that of the United States and 45 times as high as Germany’s. Jacob Zuma, the scandal-scarred former president, has benefited from this misery, helping start a new party, umKhonto weSizwe, or M.K., which won nearly 15 percent of the vote, mostly at the expense of his former party, the A.N.C. Mr. Zuma attracts a feverish following among disillusioned A.N.C. supporters, who accuse the party of selling out to wealthy white businesspeople and not moving aggressively enough to redistribute wealth to the Black majority after apartheid. India’s election was a comparable anti-incumbent revolt, even if Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. is still the largest party in Parliament by a wide margin. The party’s campaign spending was at least 20 times as much as that of its main opposition, the Congress Party, which had its bank accounts frozen by the government in a tax dispute on the eve of the election. The country’s news outlets have been largely bought off or bullied into silence. And yet, the results showed Mr. Modi, 73, losing his majority for the first time since he took office in 2014. Analysts said that reflected widespread dissatisfaction with how the fruits of India’s economy have been shared. While India’s steady growth has made it the envy of its neighbors — and created a conspicuous billionaire class — those riches have not flowed to the hundreds of millions of India’s poor. The government has handed out free rations of wheat, grain and cooking gas. It offers home water connections, subsidizes building supplies and gives farmers cash. But it has not tackled India’s inflation or unemployment, leaving hundreds of millions of people, especially women, chronically out of work. There is also some evidence that Mr. Modi’s appeals to Hindu nationalism were not as potent as in previous elections. The B.J.P.’s candidate did not even win the constituency that is home to the lavish Ram temple, built on grounds disputed by Hindus and Muslims. Mr. Modi inaugurated the temple just before the campaign started, hoping it would galvanize his Hindu political base. The economy figured into Mexico’s election as well, but in a very different way. While overall growth was disappointing — averaging only 1 percent a year during Mr. López Obrador’s term — the government doubled the minimum wage and strengthened the peso, lifting millions of Mexicans out of poverty. “People vote with their wallets, and it’s very obvious there’s more money in the wallets of almost everybody in Mexico,” said Diego Casteñeda Garza, a Mexican economist and historian at Uppsala University in Sweden. Still, analysts said, there was also a desire among voters to cement the change that Mr. López Obrador, a charismatic outsider, symbolized when he came to power in 2018. Even as Ms. Sheinbaum, 61, vowed to continue her mentor’s policies, she cast herself — Mexico’s first female and Jewish president — as a change agent. For Jacqueline González, 33, who works at a cargo transportation company and viewed Mexico’s previous governments as corrupt, that made voting for Ms. Sheinbaum an easy decision. “With Obrador we have already seen, although some people don’t want to admit it, some change,” Ms. González said. “Let’s hope it continues with Sheinbaum.”",india powerful leader win another term see party majority vanish

nytimes,"Rahul Gandhi, Long on the Ropes, Looks Set for an Unexpected Comeback","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-congress-rahul-gandhi.html,"Just last year, Rahul Gandhi and the once-powerful party he led, the Indian National Congress, seemed to be on the ropes and little threat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s consolidation of political power. Congress had not been a competitive factor in national elections in years, winning fewer and fewer votes each time Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party was elected. And Mr. Gandhi himself had been convicted on a slander charge and barred from holding a seat in Parliament. But on Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi and a broad opposition coalition led by his Congress party registered a far stronger showing than expected in India’s elections, setting the stage for an unlikely comeback. “He has finally arrived,” said Rasheed Kidwai, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi. “This time he has improved his vote share by at least 17 million votes, which is very substantial.” On Wednesday, Mr. Modi’s party announced that it had reached an agreement to form a governing coalition, including two parties that do not necessarily share its vision. Congress won 99 seats in the 543-seat Parliament, a gain of 47 seats, and the alliance of which it is the leading part won a total of 232. Congress and its alliance of over two dozen political groups have presented the results as a “moral victory” over a B.J.P. government that they say was trying to change the country’s Constitution and have portrayed as anathema to India’s identity as a multifaith and secular country. “The fight was to save the Constitution,” Mr. Gandhi, the son, grandson and great-grandson of Congress prime ministers, said as the results poured in. The first major sign that Congress might be able to contend came in May 2023, just a couple of months after Mr. Gandhi’s conviction for slander, when his party won the state government of Karnataka, in the south of India, from the B.J.P. The lift was temporary; Congress soon lost power in three states it governed to the B.J.P. But at the same time, political experts say, Mr. Gandhi was pushing for changes within the party, India’s oldest, which had long resisted overhauling an archaic organizational structure that kept its top leaders isolated from the grass-roots workers who deliver votes. Feelings that Congress’s leaders were corrupt and out of touch resulted in a string of defeats over a number of years and then degenerated into messy infighting within the party. For the past two years, party members say, Mr. Gandhi has tried to reverse the decline of Congress by surrounding himself with young policy analysts to help him understand the challenges facing India, as well as party veterans with their ears to the ground in towns and villages that Congress was targeting. The party has in addition improved its social media game, trumpeting its messages on platforms like WhatsApp and YouTube. Mr. Gandhi also raised his profile by embarking on two walks across India — meeting farmers in their fields and vegetable sellers on city streets; and drinking tea with recent graduates and gig workers — in an effort to show common cause with ordinary people. Perhaps most important, Congress focused on a strategy of reaching out to and cooperating with key regional players across the country whose influence had dimmed under B.J.P. rule. Congress leaders made a series of “seat-sharing” agreements with regional leaders, big and small, that strengthened the alliance against Mr. Modi’s party. To avoid splitting the anti-B.J.P. vote, Congress had its own candidates contest fewer seats. And Mr. Gandhi campaigned vigorously alongside the leaders of like-minded political groups across India. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Gandhi also won support, party leaders say, by characterizing Mr. Modi as a leader who would destroy India’s secular character. “It is a victory not just for him and our alliance partners but for the millions of poor Indians who voted to protect the secular fabric of this country,” said Srinivas B.V., another Congress leader, about Mr. Gandhi. “People showed Modi: ‘You are not God, and you can be replaced.’” Since being voted to power in 2014, Mr. Modi has sought to position Hinduism, the religion of some 80 percent of Indians, at the center of the country’s official identity. He also promised to end corruption, overhaul the economy and help India become a “developed nation” by 2047. But after his re-election in 2019, he leaned into Hindu themes to a greater extent. Mr. Gandhi’s efforts to contrast his vision for India with Mr. Modi’s largely paid off, analysts say, even if some members of his party jumped ship and sided with the B.J.P. Many of the politicians who defected from Congress to the B.J.P. lost their seats, including in West Bengal and Maharashtra, where Congress and its partners did especially well. Throughout the campaign Mr. Gandhi persistently linked Mr. Modi with Gautam Adani, Asia’s richest man, saying the prime minister was working for his tycoon friends, not for the vast majority of Indians who are poor. As if to vindicate this line of attack, over the two days after the election results were announced, the price of Mr. Adani’s flagship stock fell by 14 percent. (It then recovered somewhat on Wednesday.) “People directly correlate Adani Ji with Modi Ji — directly,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters after the results, using Hindi honorifics for the two men. Researchers who traveled across India during the voting said Mr. Gandhi had beaten Mr. Modi on his own turf in many places by focusing on issues like the millions of Indians without jobs and the economic difficulties faced by farmers. He also accused the B.J.P. of governance failures and worked with local political groups fighting for social justice and for the empowerment of lower-caste Indians. Uttar Pradesh, where Mr. Modi made dozens of visits to campaign for local candidates, is one state where the changing fortunes of the two largest political groupings was evident. The state is India’s largest, and accounts for 80 of the Parliament’s 543 seats. The B.J.P. recorded its worst performance there since 2009, in part because Mr. Gandhi was able to craft an alliance with a powerful local leader, Akhilesh Yadav. In addition to the 37 seats picked up by Mr. Yadav’s Samajwadi Party, Congress won six, helped by aggressive campaigning by Mr. Gandhi’s sister, Priyanka Vadra, who helped defeat a former soap-opera actress who had served as a minister in Mr. Modi’s government. The B.J.P. won 33 seats, down from 62 in the previous Parliament. The election results announced on Wednesday have given a major lift to hundreds of thousands of Congress workers across the country, who were growing tired of the internal infighting that has plagued their party for years. Outside Congress headquarters in New Delhi, Bansi Lal Meena, a veteran Congress member from the state of Rajasthan, was exultant about his party’s performance. “In villages and on the ground, the B.J.P. spread lies for years against us — saying that we are anti-Hindu,” he said. “They used my religion as a weapon against me to win votes.” He added: “We will show them now because our people are also in Parliament.”",last year rahul gandhi oncepowerful party led indian national congress seemed rope little threat prime minister narendra modis consolidation political power congress competitive

nytimes,Narendra Modi Fell to Earth After Making It All About Himself,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-election-modi.html,"When everything became about Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, his party and its century-old Hindu-nationalist network were propelled to unimagined heights. On the back of his singular charisma and political skill, a onetime-fringe religious ideology was pulled to the center of Indian life. Landslide election victories remade India’s politics, once dominated by diverse coalitions representing a nation that had shaped its independence on secular principles. But there were always risks in wrapping a party’s fortunes so completely in the image of one man, in inundating a country of many religions, castes and cultures with that leader’s name, face and voice. Voters could start to think that everything was about him, not them. They could even revolt. On Tuesday, Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., fell back to earth. After having promised their biggest election romp yet, they lost more than 60 seats. Mr. Modi will remain in office for a third term, but only with the help of a contentious coalition of parties, some of which are opposed to his core beliefs and want power of their own. With the result, India’s strained democracy appeared to roar back to life, its beaten-down political opposition reinvigorated. And after a decade in which Mr. Modi’s success in entrenching Hindu supremacy had often felt like the new common sense, India is seeing its leader and itself in a new light, and trying to understand this unexpected turn. Most fundamentally, the opposition, newly coalesced for what it called a do-or-die moment as Mr. Modi increasingly tilted the playing field, found a way to use the cult of personality around him to its advantage. Opposition leaders focused on bread-and-butter issues, often at granular levels in particular constituencies. They hammered Mr. Modi over persistent unemployment and stark inequality. But the B.J.P., with Mr. Modi from on high its only spokesman, was often left with just one answer: Trust in “Modi’s guarantee.” “The ‘Modi’s guarantee’ slogan turned out to be our undoing,” said Ajay Singh Gaur, a B.J.P. worker who had campaigned in the party stronghold of Uttar Pradesh, the northern state where Mr. Modi suffered his biggest blow on Tuesday, losing nearly half of the B.J.P. seats. “The opposition made that sound like this was not about him having delivered, or trying to deliver,” Mr. Gaur said, “but about him being an arrogant politician.” Mr. Modi gave his adversaries a lot to work with, even declaring that he may not be “biological” and that he had been sent by God. He has still emerged better so far than other Indian leaders who deeply centralized power. He remains in control of levers of power that could help him and his party restore their dominance. Indira Gandhi, who had also glorified herself and went so far as to suspend India’s democracy after declaring a national emergency, was voted out at the peak of her powers before returning three years later. But Mr. Modi’s B.J.P., the world’s largest political party, finds itself in a tough spot after years of centralization and reliance on a government machinery put to the service of one man, analysts say. The huge advantage the party has built in numbers and resources is undercut by a lack of internal consultation and delegation of authority. That was a key reason for its failure in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, with 240 million people, and surrounding states. Local B.J.P. leaders were disenchanted by a top-down approach toward choosing candidates, as well as what they called a misguided belief that Mr. Modi’s popularity could allow the party to sidestep potent local issues and caste factors. With Mr. Modi sucking up all the oxygen at the top, other senior leaders of the party have been left to fight for relevance and a voice. His relentless self-promotion has also alienated the leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., the B.J.P.’s right-wing fountainhead. During election seasons, the R.S.S. activates its vast grass-roots network in support of B.J.P. candidates. While Mr. Modi, a former foot soldier in the organization, has advanced many of its goals, his consolidation of power goes against its regimented nature and its focus on ideology over individual personalities. One R.S.S. insider, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking, said that Mr. Modi’s exalting of himself had created such resentment inside the group that some of its leaders welcomed any sort of reality check for him, short of his ouster. Sudheendra Kulkarni, a political analyst who served as an aide to the first B.J.P. prime minister in the 1990s, said Mr. Modi had pushed through unpopular legislation — in particular farm laws that prompted a yearlong protest that choked New Delhi — without consulting with party officials in the affected states. They were left to cope with the ramifications. “The B.J.P. was never a one-leader party,” Mr. Kulkarni said. “All that changed with Narendra Modi in 2014. He sought to promote a new authoritarian idea of one nation, one leader.” Hypothesizing that Mr. Modi’s popularity had peaked, the opposition saw an opening to go after a decisive section of votes in the Indian political formula. For decades before his rise in 2014, neither the B.J.P. nor the Indian National Congress, the country’s two largest parties, could muster majorities on its own. Mr. Modi expanded his party’s backing by consolidating right-wing Hindu voters and drawing in new supporters with his personal story of a humble caste and economic background and a promise to change lives through robust development. A decade later, in this year’s election, the opposition found traction in painting a very different picture of Mr. Modi — as an autocratic friend of billionaires. Since Mr. Modi had achieved everything he had set out to do, the opposition argued, his pursuit of a resounding majority could only mean that he would seek radical change to the Constitution. That claim stirred anxiety among India’s Dalits and other underprivileged groups, who see the Constitution as their only protection in a deeply unequal society, guaranteeing them a share of government jobs and seats in higher education as well as elected bodies. The opposition was able to push the message harder when some in Mr. Modi’s right-wing support base, long seen as having an upper-caste bias, called for revoking the quotas. Caste identity was a major driving factor for voters in many states, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, with its 80 parliamentary seats. The decline of a Dalit party in the state meant that about 20 percent of the votes were potentially up for grabs. In Ayodhya, the constituency where Mr. Modi inaugurated a grand Ram temple earlier this year in an effort to consolidate his Hindu support base, the opposition put up a Dalit candidate. He handily defeated the B.J.P.’s two-term incumbent. In other cases, voters showed their anger over the B.J.P.’s perceived sense of impunity. In Kheri, a constituency where the son of a B.J.P. minister rammed his S.U.V. into a crowd of protesting farmers, killing several, the minister also lost. Mr. Modi’s election campaign took its most divisive turn in Banswara, in the desert state of Rajasthan, where he called India’s 200 million Muslims “infiltrators” and raised fears that the opposition would give them India’s wealth, including Hindu women’s necklaces. Banswara’s B.J.P. incumbent was routed in the election. While the loss was most likely attributable to local issues, the national discussion noted that Mr. Modi’s comments had not helped. In his own constituency of Varanasi, in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Modi’s winning margin of nearly half a million votes in 2019 shrank to about 150,000 — a disappointing showing after he had dispatched some of the B.J.P.’s most senior leaders to camp out there to help him achieve an even bigger victory. Jai Prakash, a tea and samosa seller in Varanasi, said some of the prime minister’s work, particularly his improvement of roads, was popular. But Mr. Modi was losing the plot, Mr. Prakash said, by turning to issues disconnected from people’s day-to-day lives. “Prices are skyrocketing; so is unemployment,” Mr. Prakash said. “He has done some good. But people cannot worship him endlessly.”",everything became prime minister narendra modi india party centuryold hindunationalist network propelled unimagined height back singular charisma political

nytimes,"India Keeps Its Glorious, Messy Tradition Alive","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/opinion/india-election-modi-bjp-democracy.html,"Back in January, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India looked all but unstoppable, he visited the small city of Ayodhya for the unofficial start of his campaign to win a third term. The location was freighted with symbolism. For decades, Hindu nationalists had sought to build a temple in Ayodhya, at a spot they believe to be the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. The only problem was that there was already a house of worship on the spot, a mosque built by a Mughal emperor in 1528. A Hindu mob had dismantled the mosque in 1992, setting off riots that killed 2,000 people, most of them Muslims. The ruins were a flashpoint of religious tensions in India for decades. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party promised to build the temple, and the lavish event at which Modi officially opened it was a showcase for that achievement. At the time it seemed like strong election-year messaging for a politician who built his career on the twin planks of Hindu nationalism and building a muscular new India. Unlike other politicians, the event implied, Modi made promises and kept them. “It is the beginning of a new era,” he declared. Feeling supremely confident, Modi had boldly asked the Indian electorate for something akin to a blank check to remake the country — control of 400 seats in Parliament in elections that began in April and concluded on June 1. And why shouldn’t he have been confident? India’s economy was the fastest-growing in the world. India had overtaken China as the world’s most-populous country. World leaders sought Modi’s support on issues ranging from the war in Ukraine to the climate crisis, cementing India’s ascent in global affairs. But the ever unpredictable electorate of the world’s largest democracy responded to Modi’s demand for still more power resolutely: No thanks. In a stunning rebuke, election results released on Tuesday showed that India’s voters have reduced the parliamentary share of Modi’s party by more than 60 seats, not enough for an outright majority, never mind the supermajority he had sought. It struck me as particularly apt that despite all the fanfare about the glorious new temple in Ayodhya, Modi’s party lost the city’s parliamentary seat to a political opposition that had been all but left for dead. There appears to be a clear ceiling to the appeals to Hindu identity on its own. “We are very happy with the temple, but people were fed up with the B.J.P.,” a local business leader, Rakesh Yadav, told Reuters. “People will not always fall for the caste or temple-mosque politics. They also want to see development.” This is a big year for democracy, almost a referendum of sorts on the very idea. Dozens of countries are holding elections, representing roughly half of the world’s population. But authoritarianism has been on the march. The latest report from Freedom House found that by many measures, global freedom has declined for the 18th straight year. India, despite its status as the world’s most-populous democracy, has been a poster child for this decline under Modi: His government has taken aim at just about every form of freedom. He has attacked and grievously weakened the independence of India’s once boisterous press. He has jailed critics and political opponents. He has sharpened religious animosity, referring during this campaign to Muslims, who make up 14 percent of India’s population, as “infiltrators” who seek to steal wealth and power from the Hindu majority. It’s an Indian edition of the nationalist, populist playbook playing out around the world. That a newly unified opposition managed to prevent Modi’s party from winning an outright majority under these conditions took everyone, including me, by surprise. And it suggests that even when would-be authoritarians attempt to tilt the playing field, voters can and will state their will, no matter the autocrat’s preferences. “The B.J.P. had positioned itself as a new hegemonic power,” Yamini Aiyar, a scholar and analyst of Indian democracy who has been a frequent target of Hindu nationalist rage, told me. “The beauty of an election is that politicians have to go to the people, and the people get an opportunity to express their anxieties and their perspectives.” Express them they did. Looking back, the weakness of the B.J.P.’s re-election case is clear: Yes, India’s economy was growing fast. But despite the flashy new infrastructure projects and deals to increase high-tech manufacturing, the growth was not creating nearly enough jobs, and inflation remained stubbornly high, especially for food, which hits the poorest hardest. Much of the wealth generated by growth has gone to India’s richest tycoons, and inequality has soared. “The reality is that the real economy has been hurting for a very long time, and they have systematically sought to ignore it,” Aiyar said. India has managed to lift millions of people out of poverty since Modi came to power 10 years ago, but particularly in rural areas, where most Indians live, that has meant social welfare rather than jobs. There were other issues too — Modi’s allies had floated the idea of changing India’s Constitution in various ways, including removing its commitment to secularism and enshrining Hinduism as the national faith. These kinds of appeals have helped the B.J.P. in the past but seem to have had less power this time around. One clear sign was its heavy losses in Uttar Pradesh, which is not just India’s most populous state; it is also part of the heavily Hindu heartland of northern India. It also seems that the opposition may finally have gotten its act together. India’s main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, has been in decline for years and had struggled to make common cause with other opposition parties in previous elections. But this year the opposition parties managed to make a much stronger coalition. They focused on kitchen table issues and highlighted the Modi government’s ties to big business and high-flying billionaires. The opposition didn’t shy away from making the stakes for Indian democracy clear. But the relentless focus on what voters said mattered most offers lessons for those battling revanchist movements elsewhere, including in the United States. Sometimes you need to meet voters where they are. This vote wasn’t a total rebuke of Modi and his policies. He is all but certain to get his third term as prime minister by making a coalition with allied parties. But it is a clear and salutary check on his authoritarian project. This election is also a rebuke of Indian elites — in business and media especially — who had willingly surrendered to a kind of inevitability of Modi’s long-term consolidation of power, making peace with it or even celebrating it. Activists, analysts and journalists who had the temerity to speak plainly about Modi’s revanchist project and the threat he posed to the world’s biggest democracy and its long history of tolerance, secularism and free speech have been hounded out of public life. I hope that this troubling slide ends now. As the results rolled in on Tuesday, I remembered my own reporting trip to Ayodhya in 2009, when I was a correspondent for The Times based in India. An explosive new government report had just been issued about the destruction of the mosque and the role of Hindu nationalist groups in stirring up violence. But when I got there, I was surprised to find that on the hotly contested spot itself there was hardly any hoopla. The crowds of Hindu nationalist volunteers who for years had routinely shown up to build the temple with their bare hands had disappeared. India was going through a period of hopeful prosperity. Voters had just returned the Indian National Congress party and its allies to power with a larger majority, and a brilliant, teetotaling economist named Manmohan Singh was prime minister. With the future looking so alluring, no one seemed all that interested in litigating the past. These hopes were ultimately dashed amid scandals over political corruption and mismanagement. The Congress party, which once seemed unstoppable, lost power in 2014 for failing to deliver on its promise to bring India to its long-awaited place among the world’s richest and most powerful nations. The years ahead will, with any luck, be ones of negotiation and compromise. This will be a return to form for India, a vastly diverse nation whose unruly polity has resisted autocracy at every turn since it shrugged off British colonial rule in 1947. The whole world should breathe a sigh of relief that India’s voters have spoken, loudly, in favor of continuing that glorious, messy tradition.",back january prime minister narendra modi india looked

nytimes,The New Kingmakers Who Could Make or Break Modi’s Government,"June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-elections-modi-coalition.html,"After his first two national election victories, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India easily set his own terms, with his Bharatiya Janata Party winning clear majorities. The result was different in this vote. It was still a victory, but one that left him dependent on a host of coalition partners — particularly on politicians from two regional parties who could make or break Mr. Modi’s ability to form a government. Of the more than a dozen parties that make up the B.J.P.’s coalition, known as the National Democratic Alliance, most won just one or two seats, leaving the party in a difficult predicament. On Wednesday, the B.J.P. said it had reached an agreement to form a coalition government that includes those two regional parties — the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United. They will be the biggest junior partners, but they are also avowedly secular and removed from Mr. Modi’s Hindu-nationalist ideology. Cameras on Wednesday followed every word, meeting and movement of the leaders of the two parties, N. Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party, and Nitish Kumar of Janata Dal-United. Their combined 28 seats in Parliament will give the prime minister the votes he needs to stay in power and push through his agenda. Here is what to know about the men who unexpectedly found themselves as kingmakers, and about the parties they lead. Though some of the members of the B.J.P.’s coalition this year share Mr. Modi’s hard-line vision, both the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United are moderate, secular parties that have a diverse support base. Speculation in India was focusing on what terms the men were demanding for their support, which are unlikely to be rooted in ideology. Both Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar are known to be pragmatic, deal-making politicians whose priorities will be practical concessions for their state, or perhaps cabinet positions. Mr. Kumar has earned a reputation in India for his willingness to switch allegiances over the past decade. He has gone between aligning himself with the B.J.P.-led coalition to supporting its rivals no fewer than five times. Most recently, in January, he returned to Mr. Modi’s alliance just 18 months after he’d left it and with just months to go until the election. He has said his switching of political loyalties was in the interest of his state, Bihar. Mr. Naidu has also at times broken with Mr. Modi, cutting ties with the B.J.P. in 2018 and joining forces with its chief rival, Indian National Congress, ahead of the 2019 elections. He has said that his party has aligned with the B.J.P. out of “political compulsion.” Mr. Naidu and Mr. Kumar have both been in politics for decades, and have been mentioned as potential candidates for prime minister. Mr. Naidu of the T.D.P., based in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, is a technocrat who has aggressively pushed for investment from information technology companies in his region. His policies helped bring high-paying jobs for I.T. professionals and transformed the city of Hyderabad. Mr. Kumar is a nine-time chief minister of Bihar, India’s poorest state, who comes from a homegrown socialist background. He has pushed for more funds for low-caste Hindus, and his alliance with the B.J.P. broadened support for the party in his state.",first two national election victory prime minister narendra modi india easily set term bharatiya janata party winning clear majority result different vote still victory one left dependent host coalition partner particularly politician two regional party could make break mr modis ability form government dozen party make bjps coalition known national democratic alliance one two seat leaving party difficult predicament wednesday bjp said reached agreement form coalition government includes two regional party telugu desam party janata dalunited biggest junior partner also avowedly secular removed mr modis hindunationalist ideology camera wednesday followed every word meeting movement leader two party n chandrababu naidu telugu desam party nitish kumar janata dalunited combined seat parliament give prime minister vote need stay power push agenda know men unexpectedly found kingmaker party lead though member bjps coalition year share mr modis hardline vision telugu desam party janata dalunited moderate secular party diverse support base speculation india focusing term men demanding support unlikely rooted ideology mr naidu mr kumar known pragmatic dealmaking politician whose priority practical concession state perhaps cabinet position mr kumar earned reputation india willingness switch allegiance past decade gone aligning bjpled coalition supporting rival fewer five time recently january returned mr modis alliance month hed left month go election said switching political loyalty interest state bihar mr naidu also time broken mr modi cutting tie bjp joining force chief rival indian national congress ahead election said party aligned bjp political compulsion mr naidu mr kumar politics decade mentioned potential candidate prime minister mr naidu tdp based southern state andhra pradesh technocrat aggressively pushed investment information technology company region policy helped bring highpaying job professional transformed city hyderabad mr kumar ninetime chief minister bihar india poorest state come homegrown socialist background pushed fund lowcaste hindu alliance bjp broadened support party state
nytimes,"Modi se reelige en India, pero pierde mayoría parlamentaria: 4 claves de las elecciones","June 5, 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/06/05/espanol/elecciones-india-modi.html,"[Estamos en WhatsApp. Empieza a seguirnos ahora] La primera década de Narendra Modi como primer ministro de India ha estado plagada de sorpresas. Ninguna, sin embargo, se comparó con lo que ocurrió el martes por la mañana, cuando Modi ganó su segunda reelección, pero su partido perdió la mayoría en el Parlamento. Con esa derrota, el aire de invencibilidad de Modi también pareció desvanecerse por primera vez desde que asumió el cargo en 2014. Los resultados de las elecciones fueron particularmente interesantes porque, tras casi siete semanas de votaciones en todo el país, las encuestas a pie de urna publicadas pocos días antes del recuento final mostraban que el Partido Popular Indio de Modi ganaría de forma aplastante, como ya había hecho en dos ocasiones anteriores. Sin embargo, el Partido Popular Indio solo obtuvo 239 escaños, muy por debajo de los 272 necesarios para formar gobierno. La alianza de la oposición, liderada por el Partido del Congreso Nacional Indio, obtuvo 235 escaños. Con los 52 escaños obtenidos por los aliados del Partido Popular Indio, Modi seguirá a la cabeza. Pero su atractivo ha disminuido y su liderazgo ha cambiado radicalmente. Cuando Modi llegó al poder en 2014, prometió progreso económico, el fin de la corrupción y la promoción del hinduismo como elemento central de la identidad india. Con todo ello, se presentó como un líder singularmente fuerte, capaz de reunir a sus seguidores para trabajar por la nación. Esto contrastaba con el gobierno anterior. Antes de que Modi fuera elegido por primera vez, India llevaba 25 años gobernada por coaliciones. Los primeros ministros del Partido del Congreso, del Partido Popular Indio y de terceros partidos más pequeños se alternaban para dirigir India por comités. Modi rompió con esa tradición y lideró un nuevo sistema de partido único dominado por el Partido Popular Indio. Como líder, Modi mostró poco interés en compartir el poder. Cuando invalidó la mayor parte del papel moneda de India en 2016, ni siquiera su ministro de Finanzas conocía la decisión de antemano. Cuando decidió imponer la ley marcial en Jammu y Cachemira, el único estado de mayoría musulmana de India, presentó el plan al Parlamento como un hecho, sin pedir su aprobación. Pero esos días han terminado. Los dos mayores partidos que han surgido como nuevos socios de coalición del Partido Popular Indio están liderados por N. Chandrababu Naidu y Nitish Kumar, legisladores veteranos a quienes se conoce como tecnócratas moderados. Es probable que ambos exijan más autoridad en el Parlamento. De hecho, ambos han sido señalados como posibles candidatos a primer ministro, si se produjera otra coalición que no estuviera liderada ni por el Partido Popular Indio ni por el Congreso Nacional Indio. Cuando el martes se dieron a conocer los primeros mapas electorales nacionales que mostraban el número de escaños ganados y perdidos en el Parlamento, se observó una nueva y sorprendente configuración. Los mapas mostraban que el partido de Modi había perdido zonas de territorio en los estados del norte de habla hindi, considerados bastiones del Partido Popular Indio. Al mismo tiempo, el su partido avanzó en regiones que se habían resistido a Modi en el pasado. Perdió decenas de escaños en el estado septentrional de Uttar Pradesh, pero ganó muchos en el estado oriental de Odisha y en el estado meridional de Telangana. La única parte del país que ahora parece unificada por un partido es el “cinturón tribal”, que atraviesa los estados centrales. Sus comunidades relativamente pobres han sido hábilmente puestas en la mira de la política hinduista y los beneficios sociales del Partido Popular Indio. Los inversores de los mercados bursátiles indios de Mumbai respondieron con entusiasmo a las primeras encuestas a pie de urna. El lunes, se lanzaron a la compra, haciendo subir los precios de las llamadas acciones de Modi, aquellas asociadas a las prioridades de gasto del primer ministro o que se cree que se benefician de sus políticas fiscales. Cuando se conocieron los resultados de las urnas, esas acciones se desplomaron. Las acciones del buque insignia del Grupo Adani perdieron cerca del 19 por ciento de su valor en un solo día de cotización. El índice bursátil perdió cerca del 6 por ciento, casi anulando las ganancias de los cinco primeros meses del año. Modi sigue siendo popular entre los magnates de India, pero los inversores deben averiguar qué empresas se beneficiarán del nuevo gobierno. Chris Wood, responsable mundial de estrategia de renta variable del banco de inversión Jefferies, advirtió el año pasado que si Modi perdía, “cabría esperar una corrección del 25 por ciento, si no más”, en el mercado bursátil indio. Históricamente, a las empresas indias les ha ido igual de bien durante los periodos de gobierno de coalición. Por lo tanto, Wood dijo que, incluso sin Modi en el poder, espera que las acciones “se recuperen bruscamente” sobre la base de la fortaleza de la economía del país en su conjunto. Esta nueva era en el Parlamento empezará seguramente con algunas rondas de retribuciones políticas. Los políticos que no hayan conseguido escaños para sus jefes serán despedidos. Es probable que los partidos más pequeños exijan puestos en el gabinete, lo que significará sustituir a miembros del Partido Popular Indio. Habrá que revisar las políticas. ¿Se inclinará India por la exportación de manufacturas, con el objetivo de sustituir a China como la fábrica del mundo? ¿Protegerá ahora a las industrias locales que temen la competencia extranjera? Milan Vaishnav, investigador de la Fundación Carnegie para la Paz Internacional, advirtió que India no puede volver exactamente a la política de coalición que precedió a Modi. Es probable que sus nuevos socios exijan un estilo autoritario similar al que Modi ejerce desde Nueva Delhi. El tipo de líderes estatales que necesita ahora como socios de coalición “son tan absolutistas como el gobierno nacional”, dijo Vaishnav. Podrían, por ejemplo, pedir a la policía federal que detuviera a sus oponentes, como ha hecho Modi. Las elecciones de India fueron las mayores celebradas en la historia de la democracia, con más de 600 millones de votantes en seis fases. Esta vez no hubo quejas sobre las máquinas de votación electrónica, ni temores de que India se hubiera convertido en una dictadura bajo el mandato de Modi. En un discurso difícil pronunciado el martes por la noche desde la sede del Partido Popular Indio, Modi calificó las elecciones de “celebración de la democracia”.",estamos en whatsapp empieza

bbc,India's Priyanka Gandhi to finally make electoral debut,13 hrs ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjmmg4pm0m4o,"Priyanka Gandhi, sister of India's main opposition Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, is set to contest her first election, ending decades of anticipation by her supporters. Ms Gandhi is a descendant of the Nehru-Gandhi family, India's most famous political dynasty, and her electoral debut will be closely watched. The 52-year-old will contest the Wayanad seat in the southern Indian state of Kerala after her brother relinquishes it. A win for Ms Gandhi would mean the presence of all three Gandhi family members in the Indian parliament. Her mother Sonia Gandhi, former president of the Congress party, is an MP in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the parliament. Her brother Mr Gandhi won the recent parliamentary elections from both Wayanad and Uttar Pradesh's Rae Bareli seats. Mr Gandhi, who has represented Wayanad as an MP since 2019, is giving it up as he can only retain one parliamentary seat under Indian law. On Monday, he thanked the people of Wayanad for their ""love, affection and support"". A date for the by-election is yet to be announced but Ms Gandhi says she is ""not nervous at all"". ""I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad and I will not let them feel his [Rahul Gandhi's] absence,"" she said on Monday. ""I will work hard and I will try my best to make everyone happy and be a good representative."" The by-election will mark the end of a decades-long wait by Congress supporters for Ms Gandhi's involvement in electoral politics. Journalist Javed Ansari, who has reported on the Congress party for decades, told BBC Hindi that he was not surprised by the announcement. ""I think it was a question of when [she would contest] and not if,"" he said. For years, Ms Gandhi was considered the more popular of the Gandhi siblings with many blaming the ""lacklustre leadership"" of her brother for a string of Congress defeats between 2014 and 2019. From an early age, people have pointed to Ms Gandhi’s resemblance to her grandmother and former prime minister Indira Gandhi. Ms Gandhi was actively involved in the election campaigns of her mother from the late 1990s. She also campaigned for her brother when he actively joined politics in 2004. Senior leaders have praised her political acumen and her flair for engaging with people. Ms Gandhi's official entry into politics came when she was put in charge of the Congress campaign in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh state, ahead of the 2019 general election. The Congress went on to perform poorly in that election and the state assembly polls in 2022, but Ms Gandhi was not blamed. Senior party leaders said the performance was not a reflection of her work and in line with their expectations. Appointed Congress' general secretary in 2019, Ms Gandhi has since overseen the party's campaigns in several state elections. Party leaders say she’s been crucial in stabilising the Congress government in Himachal Pradesh state this year amid rebellion by some of its own lawmakers. She was also at the forefront of the Congress's campaign in Uttar Pradesh state - where opposition parties performed surprisingly well - and especially in the Gandhi family bastions of Amethi and Rae Bareli. ""She held the fort for Rahul and that is how he could campaign across the country,"" Mr Ansari said.

bbc,India's Priyanka Gandhi to finally make electoral debut,13 hrs ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjmmg4pm0m4o,"Priyanka Gandhi, sister of India's main opposition Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, is set to contest her first election, ending decades of anticipation by her supporters. Ms Gandhi is a descendant of the Nehru-Gandhi family, India's most famous political dynasty, and her electoral debut will be closely watched. The 52-year-old will contest the Wayanad seat in the southern Indian state of Kerala after her brother relinquishes it. A win for Ms Gandhi would mean the presence of all three Gandhi family members in the Indian parliament. Her mother Sonia Gandhi, former president of the Congress party, is an MP in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the parliament. Her brother Mr Gandhi won the recent parliamentary elections from both Wayanad and Uttar Pradesh's Rae Bareli seats. Mr Gandhi, who has represented Wayanad as an MP since 2019, is giving it up as he can only retain one parliamentary seat under Indian law. On Monday, he thanked the people of Wayanad for their ""love, affection and support"". A date for the by-election is yet to be announced but Ms Gandhi says she is ""not nervous at all"". ""I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad and I will not let them feel his [Rahul Gandhi's] absence,"" she said on Monday. ""I will work hard and I will try my best to make everyone happy and be a good representative."" The by-election will mark the end of a decades-long wait by Congress supporters for Ms Gandhi's involvement in electoral politics. Journalist Javed Ansari, who has reported on the Congress party for decades, told BBC Hindi that he was not surprised by the announcement. ""I think it was a question of when [she would contest] and not if,"" he said. For years, Ms Gandhi was considered the more popular of the Gandhi siblings with many blaming the ""lacklustre leadership"" of her brother for a string of Congress defeats between 2014 and 2019. From an early age, people have pointed to Ms Gandhi’s resemblance to her grandmother and former prime minister Indira Gandhi. Ms Gandhi was actively involved in the election campaigns of her mother from the late 1990s. She also campaigned for her brother when he actively joined politics in 2004. Senior leaders have praised her political acumen and her flair for engaging with people. Ms Gandhi's official entry into politics came when she was put in charge of the Congress campaign in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh state, ahead of the 2019 general election. The Congress went on to perform poorly in that election and the state assembly polls in 2022, but Ms Gandhi was not blamed. Senior party leaders said the performance was not a reflection of her work and in line with their expectations. Appointed Congress' general secretary in 2019, Ms Gandhi has since overseen the party's campaigns in several state elections. Party leaders say she’s been crucial in stabilising the Congress government in Himachal Pradesh state this year amid rebellion by some of its own lawmakers. She was also at the forefront of the Congress's campaign in Uttar Pradesh state - where opposition parties performed surprisingly well - and especially in the Gandhi family bastions of Amethi and Rae Bareli. ""She held the fort for Rahul and that is how he could campaign across the country,"" Mr Ansari said. Political commentator Neerja Chowdhury said it would be interesting to see the siblings in parliament together if Ms Gandhi wins. “Personally, I think Priyanka is savvier of the two. She thinks on her feet and her language is clearer than his,"" she said, adding that she will be ""watched very closely"". Congress leaders and workers in Kerala have expressed happiness at the possibility of having Ms Gandhi as an MP from Wayanad.

bbc,Will India's Booker Prize-winning author face jail for 14-year-old remark?,21 hrs ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggyz13m2po,"Will one of India's most celebrated writers really face prosecution for things she said more than a decade ago? Last week, 14 years after the original complaint, Delhi's most senior official granted permission for the Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy to be prosecuted under India’s stringent anti-terror laws. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) is notorious for making it exceptionally challenging to get bail, often resulting in years of detention until the completion of trial. The Modi government has been accused of using the law to silence critics, including activists, journalists and civil society members. Ms Roy, 62, an outspoken writer and activist, is in the dock for comments on Kashmir, a perennial lightning rod in India. “Kashmir has never been an integral part of India. It is a historical fact. Even the Indian government has accepted this,” she said at a stormy, day-long conference in Delhi, organised by the Committee for the Release of Political Prisoners, in October 2010. At the time, Indian-administered Kashmir was in turmoil, with locals describing it as a fierce uprising against India. Ms Roy's remarks had followed the deaths of dozens of protesters since fresh pro-freedom demonstrations broke out earlier that year. India and neighbouring Pakistan, nuclear armed-rivals, claim the disputed region in full and have fought two wars over it. Ms Roy’s remarks predictably set off a firestorm of protest, with many critics questioning her loyalty to India, and the federal government, then led by the Congress party, threatening to arrest her on charges of sedition. A senior minister  said while India enjoyed freedom of speech, ""it can't violate the patriotic sentiments of the people"". There were protests outside Ms Roy's home in an upscale Delhi neighbourhood. A criminal complaint was lodged against her and another defendant Sheikh Showkat Hussain, a law teacher from Kashmir, accusing them and two others of sedition. Ms Roy defended her right to free speech soon after the controversy. ""In the papers some have accused me of giving 'hate-speeches', of wanting India to break up. On the contrary, what I say comes from love and pride,"" she wrote in a response. ""It comes from not wanting people to be killed, raped, imprisoned or have their finger-nails pulled out in order to force them to say they are Indians... Pity the nation that has to silence its writers for speaking their minds."" Lawyers are puzzled by the decision to prosecute Ms Roy more than a decade after her speech. She was originally accused of sedition, but the Supreme Court suspended the colonial-era sedition law in May 2022; invoking UAPA charges allows the state to bypass the statute of limitations and proceed with the case. Ms Roy has been a trenchant critic of Mr Modi's government, which rights groups accuse of targeting activists and muzzling free speech. The permission for her prosecution comes just after Mr Modi's re-election for a third term. Many view this as a political signal that the BJP will continue its strong-arm tactics, even in coalition government. Sushil Pandit, the main complainant from 2010, refused to speculate on the delay. ""Those who sat on these files and decided to act now should explain. There must be an inquiry into why this was delayed, and accountability should follow,"" he told Times Now television. Others view this as another attempt to silence Mr Modi's critics. Writer Amitav Ghosh wrote on X: ""The hounding of Arundhati Roy is absolutely unconscionable. She is a great writer and has the right to her opinion. There should be an international outcry against prosecuting her for something she said a decade ago."" When Delhi authorities approved the case to proceed in court in October, Canadian writer and activist Naomi Klein warned Mr Modi on X: ""You have no idea what you will unleash by pursuing this political prosecution to silence your most eloquent critic."" What exactly transpired on the day when Ms Roy made the comments? In the minutes of the conference, Shivam Vij described it as ""historic in every aspect given the topicality of the issue"". Speakers included a well-known poet, several activists and journalists. Ms Roy anticipated a heated debate. ""She began her speech by asking those who wanted to throw shoes to her to do so now,"" Mr Vij wrote. Shuddhabrata Sengupta, an artist, writer and curator who spoke at the event, wrote  that the only ""provocative actions"" - interruptions, heckling, attempts to throw objects at stage - came from ""self-declared Indian patriots"". They were allowed to speak but were asked not to disrupt the proceedings, he noted. However, Mr Pandit, the Kashmiri activist present at the meeting, had a different view. ""Openly, in the heart of the capital, Delhi, a call for the destruction of the Indian Union as a colonial, occupying state, a state that has subjugated people... had no business to survive. Such statements were made. A call to arms rang out from the podium repeatedly... by Arundhati Roy [among others].""  Over the past two decades, Ms Roy has written several non-fiction books and numerous essays on topics like nuclear weapons, Kashmir, big dams, globalisation, Dalit icon BR Ambedkar, meetings with Maoist rebels, and conversations with Edward Snowden and John Cusack. The God of Small Things, a riveting family saga inspired by her family childhood, picked up the 1997 Man Booker Prize - a ""Tiger Woodesian debut"" gushed John Updike - and made Roy a celebrity writer at 35. The 62-year-old author is also a polarising figure in India. Admirers see her as a leading voice for liberal values and a champion of the marginalised. Critics, however, have burned her effigies, disrupted her events, and she has faced charges of sedition and contempt, even spending a day in jail for protesting against big dams. They find a lot of her non-fiction writings shrill, naïve, adolescent, self-indulgent and simplistic, peddling ""picturesque poverty"". One critic wrote that so often in her essays Ms Roy ""never really gets to grips with the evidence"". Since Ms Roy's 2010 remarks, significant changes have occurred. In 2019, Mr Modi's government revoked Kashmir's semi-autonomous status, dividing the region and reducing its political autonomy under direct federal control. Many believe freedom of expression has also declined: since 2014, India has fallen from 150th to 161st in media freedom rankings by Reporters Without Borders, out of 180 countries. Ms Roy has declined to comment on the latest development. It is unclear if the police have investigated the allegations or have evidence against her and the other accused. Two individuals named in the original complaint have passed away. But one thing is certain. If one of India's most feted writers faces imprisonment under a draconian anti-terror law, it will ignite global condemnation and outrage.  Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Indian accused of plotting US Sikh murder pleads not guilty,1 day ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggy5ypj68o,"An Indian man accused of plotting to kill a Sikh separatist in New York City has pleaded not guilty in federal court. Nikhil Gupta appeared for the first time in court on Monday afternoon after being extradited from the Czech Republic and landing in the US on Friday. He is charged by US authorities with trying to hire a hitman to assassinate Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a dual US-Canadian citizen. US prosecutors allege Mr Gupta was directed by an unnamed Indian government official. India denies having anything to do with the alleged plot. Mr Gupta, 52, walked into the Manhattan federal courtroom shortly after 12:30 EDT (17:30 BST) on Monday wearing a blue sweater and black Nike sweatpants, holding his hands behind his back. After waiving the reading of his indictment, Mr Gupta was asked by Judge James Cott to enter his plea. “Not guilty,” his lawyer, Jeff Chabrowe, said on his behalf. Prosecutors asked that Mr Gupta be held in a detention centre until his trial. Mr Gupta’s lawyer said they would file a bail application at a later date, meaning Mr Gupta will be detained for now. His lawyer also complained to the judge during the 20-minute arraignment about the conditions of Mr Gupta's detention. He had not been provided a vegetarian meal since he arrived at a Brooklyn detention facility on Friday, the lawyer said. “Essentially, my client has not been able to eat,” he said. He would also need to be allowed to pray, Mr Chabrowe said. Judge Cott said Mr Chabrowe should speak to him again on Tuesday if those issues had not been resolved. Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Mr Chabrowe called the case “a complex matter for both India and the US”. He said people should refrain from “jumping to conclusions” about the allegations against Mr Gupta. “We will pursue his defence rigorously,” he said. Mr Gupta’s hearing was also attended by several Khalistan activists, including one who held the movement’s flag outside the courthouse. Mr Gupta is scheduled to appear in court again on 28 June. In November, US prosecutors charged Mr Gupta with a plot to kill at least four Sikh separatists in North America, including Mr Pannun. The charges against him carry up to 20 years in prison. Mr Gupta paid $100,000 (£79,000) in cash to a hitman to assassinate Mr Pannun, prosecutors said. The hitman, they added, was an undercover federal agent. Mr Pannun is a dual US-Canadian citizen living in New York. He is the general counsel for Sikhs for Justice, an organisation based in the US that supports the broader Khalistan movement, which calls for an independent homeland for Sikhs, who make up about 2% of India's population. Mr Pannun was designated a terrorist by the Indian government in 2020, an allegation he denies. He was also an associate of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist leader who was shot dead in Canada in his car last year. The murder led to a deterioration in India-Canada ties after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged there were ""credible allegations"" that Delhi had been involved. India denied the accusations. In November, the White House said it had raised the alleged assassination plot against Mr Pannun with India at the most senior level. Indian officials distanced themselves from the alleged plot, saying such actions were against government policy. Delhi said it had formed a committee to investigate the allegations against Mr Gupta. A group of US lawmakers urged Secretary of State Antony Blinken to lead a “strong diplomatic response” that would ensure  all parties involved “are held accountable”, according to a 17 June letter that was obtained by the BBC. The US and India ""have a crucial relationship across multiple domains"", and their ties must ""be grounded in shared commitment to democratic principles and the rule of law"", the letter adds. In January, India's Supreme Court rejected a plea from Mr Gupta which asked it to aid his release and help him get a fair trial. The petition in India claimed Mr Gupta was arrested by ""self-claimed"" US federal agents and had not yet been given a fair trial. India's top court said it would not intervene in the case, adding that it was up to the government to take action. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Nine killed in India train crash,1 day ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kkyvq081wo,"Nine people have died and around 41 have been injured in a train crash in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal. The accident occurred when a goods train hit a stationary passenger train, the Kanchenjungha Express, in the New Jalpaiguri area on Monday morning. Dramatic visuals from the accident site showed one wagon of the express train suspended in the air. Authorities say ""human error"" may have led to the crash and a detailed investigation will be held. India has one of the largest train networks in the world with millions of passengers using it daily, but a lot of the railway infrastructure needs to be improved or upgraded. Officials said ambulances and disaster teams were sent to the accident site for rescue efforts soon after the accident. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressed shock and said action was being taken on a ""war footing"". The dead include the driver and the assistant driver of the goods train and the guard of Kanchenjungha Express. ""Rescue operations have been completed,"" Jaya Varma Sinha, CEO of the Railway Board, told a press conference. The injured, she said, were being treated at a medical college in Siliguri city. ""Our first priority is for them to get the best medical aid possible."" The official said that human error seemed to be the likely cause of the accident. ""As per initial investigation, it seems that the driver of the goods train disregarded the signal."" She added that Kavach, an automatic train protection system developed by the Indian Railways, needed to be planned and expanded for West Bengal state. A police official told reporters that the engine of the goods train was damaged while three coaches of the express train were derailed. A rescue official told the Times of India they avoided using gas cutters during the relief efforts because it could endanger the lives of those trapped in the train. He said relief efforts were also slowed by heavy rain in the area. Federal Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said relief teams had worked in close coordination with railway officials to carry out rescue operations. The minister visited the site later in the day. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the incident ""saddening"" and said he had spoken to officials about the rescue efforts. ""Condolences to those who lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured recover at the earliest,"" he wrote on X. He announced a compensation of 200,000 rupees ($2,394, £1,890) for the families of the dead and 50,000 rupees for each of the injured passengers. Mr Vaishnaw later announced an enhanced compensation of 1m rupees for the dead, 250,000 rupees for those with grievous injuries and 50,000 rupees for those with minor injuries. The railways have set up a control desk with a helpline number at Rangapani station, near which the collision took place. Last year, a devastating crash involving three trains in the eastern state of Odisha had killed around 290 people and left more than 1,000 injured. After Monday's crash, India's opposition leaders criticised the government for its ""utter mismanagement"" of the railways. Congress party chief Mallikarjun Kharge alleged Mr Modi's government had turned the railways into a platform for ""self-promotion"". Kunal Ghosh, a member of West Bengal's governing Trinamool Congress (TMC) Party, also blamed Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). ""There is no safety of passengers, no improvement in technology and a lack of maintenance of the service,"" he said. The government and the railway ministry have not responded to these accusations yet. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Susannah's grandad ran Bengal when famine killed millions,3 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1vv9r4012xo,"""I feel enormous shame about what happened,"" Susannah Herbert tells me. Her grandfather was the governor of Bengal, in British India, during the run-up and height of the 1943 famine which killed at least three million people. She is only just learning about his significant role in the catastrophe, and confronting a complex family legacy. When I first meet her, she is clutching a photograph from 1940. It's Christmas Day at the governor's residence in Bengal. It's formal, with people sitting in rows, in their finery, staring straight into camera. In the front are the dignitaries - Viceroy Linlithgow, one of the most important colonial figures in India, and her grandfather Sir John Herbert, Bengal's governor. At their feet is a little boy, in a white shirt and shorts, knee-high socks and shiny shoes. It's Susannah's father. He had told her some stories of growing up in India, like the day Father Christmas came in on an elephant, but not much more. But little was spoken of her grandfather, who died in late 1943. The causes of the famine are many and complex. While John Herbert was the most important colonial figure in Bengal, he was part of a wider colonial structure. He reported to his bosses in Delhi, who reported to theirs in London. Dr Janam Mukherjee, historian and the author of Hungry Bengal, tells me Herbert ""was the colonial official most directly linked to the famine because he was the chief executive of the province of Bengal at that time"". One of the policies he executed during World War Two was known as ""denial"", where boats and rice – the staple food – were confiscated or destroyed in thousands of villages. It was done because of the fear of a Japanese invasion and the aim was to deny the enemy local resources to fuel their advance into India. However, the colonial policy was catastrophic for the already fragile local economy. Fishermen couldn't go to sea, farmers weren't able to go upstream to their plots, and artisans were unable to get their goods to market. Critically, rice could not be moved around. Inflation was already high, as the colonial government in Delhi was printing money to pay for the vast war effort on the Asian front. The hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers in Kolkata - then Calcutta - were straining food resources. Rice imports to Bengal from Burma had halted after it fell to the Japanese. Rice was hoarded, often for profit. And a deadly cyclone hit, wiping out much of Bengal's rice crop. Repeated demands - in the middle of the war - to the war cabinet and Prime Minister Winston Churchill for food imports were denied or partially heeded at the time. The numbers who died are overwhelming. I wondered why Susannah, the granddaughter of Bengal’s governor, felt shame so many decades later. She tries to explain. ""When I was young there was something almost glamorous about having a connection with the British Empire."" She says she used to borrow a lot of her grandfather's old clothes. ""There were silk scarves, with a nametape saying 'Made in British India'. ""And now when I see them at the back of a cupboard, I kind of shudder and say, why would I even want to wear these things? Because the words 'British India' on the label seem inappropriate to wear now."" Susannah is determined to know more about her grandfather's life in British India, and to make sense of things. She is reading everything she can on the Bengal famine, going through stacks of her grandparents' papers at the Herbert archive in the family home in Wales. They're kept in a climate-controlled room, and an archivist visits once a month. She starts to realise more about her grandfather. ""There's absolutely no doubt that the policies he implemented and initiated contributed enormously to the scale and impact of the famine. ""He had skills, he had honour. And he should not have been appointed to the post of running the lives of 60 million people in a faraway corner of the British Empire. He just should not have been appointed."" In the family archive she found a letter from Lady Mary, her grandmother, written to her husband in 1939, on hearing he had been offered the job of governor. It's a letter of pros and cons. She clearly had no desire for them to go, though she writes she would accept whatever decision he took. ""You read them [the letters] with hindsight, you read them knowing what the writer and reader did not know. If you could reach out to the past, you'd say: don't do it. Don't go, don't go to India. You will not do a good job."" Over the months I have been following Susannah Herbert’s journey into the past, she has had many detailed questions about her grandfather. She has been keen to meet Janam Mukherjee, the historian, to ask him directly. They meet in June. Janam admits he never imagined he would ever be sitting opposite the granddaughter of John Herbert. Susannah wants to know why her grandfather, a provincial MP and government whip, was appointed in the first place, when he had virtually no experience of Indian politics, beyond a brief spell in Delhi as a young officer. ""It's part and parcel of colonialism and stems from an idea of supremacy,"" Janam explains. ""Some MP who has no colonial experience, who has no linguistic capacities, who has not worked in a political system outside of Britain, can simply go and inhabit the governor's house in Kolkata, and make decisions about an entire population of people that he knows nothing about."" While Herbert was not popular among elected Indian politicians in Bengal, even his seniors in Delhi seem to have doubted his competence, including Viceroy Linlithgow. ""Linlithgow called him the weakest of the governors in India. They, in fact, were interested in removing him, but they were worried about how that might be received,"" says Janam. ""That is hard listening,"" Susannah replies. I am struck that for both there is a personal connection. Janam and Susannah had fathers in Kolkata who were little boys at the same time but were living completely different lives. They've both died now. Susannah at least has photographs. For Janam, there were no pictures of his father as a child. ""So what I knew was from his nightmares and from the few stories he told me of his experience in childhood, in a colonized war zone. ""I come from a sense of trying to think about my father's very damaged life and understand how that impacts me as his descendant."" And then he says something I wasn't expecting. ""My grandfather also worked for the colonial police force. So my grandfather himself was complicit with the colonial system in many ways. So there are these interesting similarities in our motivations of understanding."" At least three million people died in the Bengal famine and there is no memorial - or even a plaque - to them anywhere in the world. Susannah can at least point to a memorial to her grandfather. ""The church where we worship has a plaque honouring him."" She explains it's in the absence of a grave. She's not sure where his remains are, perhaps in Kolkata. Honour is a word that Susannah used to describe her grandfather, even though she acknowledges his failures. ""While I find it relatively easy to accept that history is much more complicated than what we were originally told, I still find it hard to envisage John Herbert […] acting in any way, dishonourably."" Janam takes a different view. ""These questions of intention have never interested me in many ways. I'm much more interested in the historical course of events because I think intentions can always mask what happens."" Eighty years on this is still complicated, and raw. I wonder if months into her research, Susannah still feels ""shame"" is the right emotion to describe how she feels? She tells me she has changed her view. ""I think the word shame centres it too much on my feelings. It's not just about me and what I think. ""It's part of a greater project, I suppose, of understanding and transmitting understanding of how we got to where we are. We? I mean Britain, I mean, this country."" Janam agrees that ""as a descendant of a colonial official, I don't think there is any particular shame that accrues intergenerationally. I think it's Britain's shame. ""I mean people died of starvation in Bengal. So I think there's cause for historical reflection on the individual level as well as the collective level."" Susannah is reflecting on her legacy. She wants to share her findings with her wider family, and she's not sure how they'll receive it. She is hoping her children might help her work her way through the mountains of papers in the family archive in Wales. They too are contending with a complex personal legacy, as Britain tries to figure out what to do with this difficult part of its war story and colonial past. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,India brings back bodies of 45 workers from Kuwait,4 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg330n9x614o,"An Indian Air Force flight has brought back the bodies of 45 workers who were killed in a fire in Kuwait. The fire broke out on Wednesday at a residential building in Mangaf city where 176 Indian workers lived. Kuwaiti authorities said 50 people were killed in the fire, including 45 from India and three from the Philippines. Two bodies are yet to be identified. Dozens of workers, most of them Indian, have also been injured in the fire. Two-thirds of the Kuwaiti population is made up of foreign workers and the country is highly dependent on migrant labour, especially in the construction and domestic sectors. Human rights groups have regularly raised concerns over their living conditions. Indian minister Kirti Vardhan Singh, who had gone to Kuwait after the incident, said DNA tests had been carried out to identify the victims. Among the workers confirmed dead, 23 are from Kerala state, seven from Tamil Nadu, three each from Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, two from Odisha and one each from Bihar, Punjab, Karnataka, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Haryana. Mr Singh said the Indian government had arranged a special Air Force flight to bring back the bodies. The flight landed in Kerala's Kochi city on Friday morning where the bodies of workers from southern Indian states were given to authorities, and then continued to Delhi. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and other state lawmakers were at the airport to receive the bodies and pay homage to them. ""This is a huge tragedy for our country. Kerala's migrant workers are the lifeblood of our state. The fire in Kuwait is one of the biggest tragedies to affect our community,"" Mr Vijayan said. The state and federal governments have announced compensation for the families of those who died in the fire. In Kuwait, authorities say they are carrying out an inspection of health and safety conditions in several buildings that house foreign workers in the country. According to the Arab Times, an investigation by authorities found that the fire started because of an electrical short circuit in the security guard’s room on the ground floor of the six-story building. A senior Kuwait fire department official had on Wednesday said that inflammable material had been used as partitions between rooms and apartments in the building. Kuwait's Public Prosecution department has detained a citizen and some expatriates on charges of manslaughter and negligence for not implementing fire safety measures, the Times reported. After the fire, Sheikh Fahad Yusuf al-Sabah, the country's deputy prime minister, had accused property owners of greed and said violations of building standards had led to the tragedy.

bbc,Can indie games inspire a creative boom from Indian developers?,5 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8vv58ry8q2o,"India might not be the first country that springs to mind when someone mentions video games, but it's one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. Analysts believe there could be more than half a billion players there by the end of this year. Most of them are playing on mobile phones and tablets, and fans will tell you the industry is mostly known for fantasy sports games that let you assemble imaginary teams based on real players. Despite concerns over gambling and possible addiction, they're big business. The country's three largest video game startups - Game 24X7, Dream11 and Mobile Premier League – all provide some kind of fantasy sport experience and are valued at over $1bn. But there's hope that a crop of story-driven games making a splash worldwide could inspire a new wave of creativity and investment. During the recent Summer Game Fest (SGF) - an annual showcase of new and upcoming titles held in Los Angeles and watched by millions - audiences saw previews of a number of story-rich titles from South Asian teams. One of those was Detective Dotson by Masala Games, based in Gujarat, about a failed Bollywood actor turned detective. Industry veteran Shalin Shodhan is behind the game and tells BBC Asian Network this focus on unique stories is “bucking the trend” in India's games industry. He wants video games to become an “interactive cultural export” but says he's found creating new intellectual property difficult. “There really isn’t anything in the marketplace to make stories about India,"" he says, despite the strength of some of the country's other cultural industries. “If you think about how much intellectual property there is in film in India, it is really surprising to think nothing indigenous exists as an original entertainment property in games,"" he says. ""It’s almost like the Indian audience accepted that we’re just going to play games from outside.” Another game shown during SGF was The Palace on the Hill – a ""slice-of-life"" farming sim set in rural India. Mala Sen, from developer Niku Games, says games like this and Detective Dotson are what “India needed”. “We know that there are a lot of people in India who want games where characters and setting are relatable to them,"" she says. Games developed by South Asian teams based in western countries have been finding critical praise and commercial success in recent years. Venba, a cooking sim that told the story of a migrant family reconnecting with their heritage through food, became the first game of its kind to take home a Bafta Game Award this year. Canada-based Visai Games, which developed the title, was revealed during SGF as one of the first beneficiaries of a new fund set up by Among Us developer Innersloth to boost fellow indie developers. That will go towards their new, unnamed project based on ancient Tamil legends. Another title awarded funding by the scheme was Project Dosa, from developer Outerloop, that sees players pilot giant robots, cook Indian food and fight lawyers. Its previous game, Thirsty Suitors, was also highly praised and nominated for a Bafta award this year. Games such as these resonating with players worldwide helps perceptions from the wider industry, says Mumbai-based Indrani Ganguly, of Duronto Games. “Finally, people are starting to see we’re not just a place for outsource work,” she says. “We’re moving from India being a technical space to more of a creative hub. “I’m not 100% seeing a shift but that’s more of a mindset thing. ""People who are able to make these kinds of games have always existed but now there is funding and resource opportunities available to be able to act on these creative visions.” British-Indian game developer Charu Desodt believes the success of titles such as Venba has been thanks to their commitment to authenticity. “They make me feel very proud,"" she says. ""We’re coming to a point where the industry is growing massively, both in terms of hours spent gaming but more importantly in the variety of the games. ""When you have authentic local stories told from the heart, that’s something everyone can relate to.” Charu says funding for ""unique and quirky stories has been an issue"" but recent successes such as Venba and Thirsty Suitors have shown there is an appetite for south Asian stories told by south Asian developers. Some of the industry's biggest companies are also paying attention. Last year, Sony launched its India Hero Project with a goal to “unearth and empower India’s brightest game development talents” via mentorship and funding. Its first cohort of games included slice-of-life games Fishbowl, museum exploration game Mukti and rhythm-action game Suri: the Seventh Note, inspired by mythical Indian stories from the Himalayas to Rajasthan. Meanwhile french publishing giant Ubisoft’s Indie Series has supported Thousand Star Studios in creating Aikyam – a Bollywood-inspired fantasy roleplaying game set to be released this year. Charu says video games and their interactivity allow people to “understand a concept on a very deep level."" “It’s not just about me appreciating my south Asian roots but its about other people really connecting with the authenticity of that experience,” says Charu. “It takes time for an industry to evolve and mature,"" she says. ""We’re in the early days as an industry as a whole, even in the west. ""But people now have access to technology and India is also a nation that loves to tell stories.” Listen to Ankur Desai's show on BBC Asian Network live from 15:00-18:00 Monday to Thursday - or listen back here.

bbc,Forty Indians among 50 dead in Kuwait block fire,5 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9ww0j74rddo,"At least 40 Indians are among 50 people killed in a fire at a residential building in the Kuwaiti city of Mangaf, India's foreign ministry has said. The fire broke out on Wednesday in a building where dozens of workers stayed. Video shared on social media showed flames engulfing the lower part of the building and thick black smoke billowing from the upper floors. Most of the casualties are from the southern Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Around 50 Indians have also been injured. Three Filipinos have also been killed, AFP quoted Philippines officials as saying. Filipino and Nepali workers are also among the injured. Two-thirds of the Kuwaiti population is made up of foreign workers and the country is highly dependent on migrant labour, especially in the construction and domestic sectors. Human rights groups have regularly raised concerns over their living conditions. Local media reports said the building housed 196 workers and there are suggestions that it may have been overcrowded. A senior police officer told state TV that there were a ""large number"" of people in the building at the time of the fire. ""Dozens were rescued, but unfortunately there were many deaths as a result of inhaling smoke from the fire,"" he said, adding that warnings were often issued about overcrowding in this type of accommodation. Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Fahad Yusuf al-Sabah accused property owners of greed and said violations of building standards had led to the tragedy. ""Unfortunately the greed of the property owners is what led to this,"" Sheikh al-Sabah, who is also acting interior minister, told Reuters news agency. ""They violate regulations and this is the result of the violations,"" he said. The original death toll was 49 but Foreign Minister Abdullah Al-Yahya said on Thursday that one person had died overnight, AFP reported. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sent his condolences to the victims and their families. ""The fire mishap in Kuwait City is saddening,"" he said on X. ""My thoughts are with all those who have lost their near and dear ones. I pray that the injured recover at the earliest."" He said the Indian embassy was monitoring the situation and working with the authorities on the ground. Kirti Vardhan Singh, a junior minister in the government who left for Kuwait on Thursday morning, said DNA tests were being carried out to identify the victims. ""An Air Force plane is on the ready. As soon as the bodies are identified, the kin will be informed and our Air Force plane will bring the bodies back,"" he told news news agency ANI. Twenty-four victims are from Kerala state while five are from neighbouring Tamil Nadu. An eyewitness, Manikandan from Tamil Nadu, told BBC Tamil that many of the workers had been on night shifts. ""Some of those who returned to that apartment early in the morning were cooking food after coming back from work,"" he said. ""Once the fire erupted, it spread rapidly. People living in the building were not able to control the fire."" Back home in India, the families of the victims who have been identified are in shock. Umaruddeen Shameer from Kerala's Kollam district worked as a driver for an oil company in Kuwait. His family is stunned after hearing about his death, said a neighbour who picked up the phone at his house. ""He was married just nine months ago when he came on a visit here,"" the neighbour told BBC Hindi without disclosing his identity. ""His parents are not in a condition to speak to anyone."" Another victim, Stephin Sabu, 29, was set to travel home to Kerala's Kottayam district next month, an acquaintance of the family told BBC Hindi. ""His father is unwell and his mother is not able to speak,"" Babu Mathew, a member of the local church, told BBC Hindi, adding that his family had been waiting for Sabu's arrival for the housewarming ceremony of the house that he had built. Others who were waiting desperately for news of their loved ones were left distressed. Earlier on Thursday, Ashrafunnisa from Villupuram in Tamil Nadu had shared her worries about not being able to contact her husband Mohammed Sharief. He was working as a foreman in Kuwait for the past decade and lived in the building which was destroyed. “I last spoke to him on Tuesday afternoon. I haven’t been able to get through to him since then,"" she said. Hours after speaking to the BBC, she got the news of his death. Additional reporting by BBC Tamil Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,The US cricket star who once played for India,7 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511x170v2wo,"In 2015, Saurabh Netravalkar gave up his dreams of playing professional cricket in India and moved to the US to work as a software engineer. “Cricket was over for me. I had no hope or expectation left to play again,” he says. On Wednesday, almost a decade later, he will face the Indian cricket team in a T20 World Cup match at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, New York. But he will do so as part of the US team. As he embarks on his World Cup dream, Netravalkar says the match will be an ""emotional moment"" for a cricketer who once played for India’s Under-19 team. “Many of my former team-mates are now playing for India,” he tells the BBC. But he is unfazed about the prospect of facing his friends in a crucial match. He is full of confidence and it showed in his impeccable bowling last week in a super over that led the US to a historic win against Pakistan. Netravalkar’s is a story of persistence, a love for cricket and, also, the American dream. Born and raised in Mumbai, Netravalkar began playing cricket when he was just 10. His family lived in Malad, a suburb in the western part of the city. After some remarkable performances as a teenager, he was picked to represent India in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand. The tall, left-arm fast bowler emerged as the leading wicket-taker of the tournament for the Indian team. Over the next few years, Netravalkar balanced his pursuit of cricket while studying to become an engineer, graduating in 2013. After that, the bowler says he decided to concentrate on cricket, giving himself two years. During this time, he attempted to get a spot in the national team as well as the Mumbai cricket team. “I got into the [Mumbai] squad too. But I couldn’t cement my place or even get into the Indian Premier League (IPL),” he says. A cricketer’s career usually starts at 23. But Netravalkar says he decided to leave the sport at that point. “I was in two minds. Should I pursue cricket or concentrate on studies?” he says. In 2015, he started studying in Cornell University in the US for a degree in computer science. “It was a difficult decision,” he says. But he could never fully let go of his cricket dreams. During his time as an engineering student in India, he’d already developed CricDeCode, an app to help cricketers analyse their game. At Cornell, Netravalkar saw students play cricket and joined a club to participate in inter-college tournaments. Soon after graduating, Netravalkar got a job with software giant Oracle and moved to California. In San Francisco, Netravalkar began playing club cricket. “They had weekend tournaments. I would work for five days and play on Saturday and Sunday.” It was far from professional cricket, but it was still a chance to play the game. “San Francisco still doesn’t have proper pitches. They play on an artificial pitch that’s more like a synthetic mat,” he says. “But they had soil pitches in a park in Los Angeles - it’s like the Maidan [a famous park] in Mumbai.” Every Friday evening, he would drive for six hours to Los Angeles to play a match on Saturday. Then he’d drive back to play a match in San Francisco on Sunday. “In the club [in Los Angeles], there were three to four players who were part of the American team,” he says. “It was then I got to know that America had a cricket team.” “On long weekends, they organised tournaments in the country, mostly in Florida, where even players from the West Indies would participate.” Those tournaments provided a good platform, but Netravalkar was still not dreaming of playing for the US national team. “I was on a student visa and then a work visa. So there was no question of playing for the team.” The International Cricket Council (ICC), which governs the sport across the world, also had a rule that required Netravalkar to have lived in the US for seven years and be a permanent resident. But the rule changed in 2018 and Netravalkar was picked for the US cricket team. In 2019, the ICC also gave international T20 status to all its associate members, including the US. “Many think it’s easier to play for obscure teams that are considered underdogs,” he says. “But the struggle is even harder here. Playing for associate countries is difficult because they lack basic infrastructure,” he explains. All players in the US team also have full-time jobs and juggle family responsibilities. ""So we practise indoors from 7-9pm.” In a country like the US, distance adds to the struggle of bringing players from different corners to play together. So the team usually meets 10 days before a tournament to practice. The US overcame these odds to progress from the upper divisions of associate cricket to playing the T20 World Cup this year. They have already qualified for the 2026 World Cup. “The standard of local cricket here has gone up,” Netravalkar says. “Major league and minor league made a huge difference because they gave us a chance to play with top players. There are better grounds being made and pitches are improving.” Cricket academies in the country are also nurturing new players. Even as fan following for the sport grows in places like California, Netravalkar says US cricket faces a tough road ahead. “There’s only one tournament in a year where you play five matches in seven days. So all our efforts throughout the year are tested in just those five days.” “If you win, then you can go ahead. Or else there’s nothing.” Before this T20 World Cup, the US beat Bangladesh in a series which boosted their confidence. Then, in the first game of this tournament, they defeated Canada before going on to upset Pakistan. Netravalkar is now preparing to face his old team-mates from India in the match on Wednesday. “It is nice to reconnect with them and I’m happy for what they have achieved - for India and in the IPL,” he says. Despite facing a star-studded team, Netravalkar is optimistic about his team’s chances. “They [India] practise for hours and we had very limited resources. But anything can happen in T20,” he says. “We are positive. We will give our best in those three hours.” Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Two Indians recruited by Russia killed in Ukraine,7 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv225e8dpdgo,"India says two of its nationals who had been recruited by the Russian army have been killed in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The Indian foreign ministry said it had urged the Russian authorities to repatriate the bodies of the two deceased. The ministry has also urged Moscow to quickly release and return all Indian nationals who are with the Russian army. Moscow is yet to comment. Dozens of Indians have reportedly been duped by agents into fighting for Russian forces with the lure of money and a Russian passport. The BBC has spoken to some of them. Some said they were coerced into taking up combat roles in the Russian army. Others have also enlisted of their own accord. ""We regret to state that two Indian nationals who had been recruited by the Russian Army have recently been killed in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine,"" the foreign ministry statement said, without naming the victims. The ministry also urged Indian nationals to ""exercise caution while seeking employment opportunities in Russia"". In May Indian police arrested four people allegedly linked to a network of human traffickers on suspicion of luring young men to Russia with the promise of jobs or education, only to force them to fight in Ukraine. At least two other Indians died earlier this year while fighting for Russian forces. Despite urging Russia to return Indian nationals serving in the Russian army, India has refused to condemn the Kremlin over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, urging the two sides to seek peace through dialogue and diplomacy. Meanwhile Nepal and Sri Lanka have warned their citizens not to be lured in by the false promises of human traffickers in recent months, after it emerged that hundreds of their nationals were taking part in the war as mercenaries. Kathmandu says at least 20 Nepalese have died fighting for Russia. At least 16 former Sri Lankan soldiers have been killed in the conflict so far, most of them for the Russian army. Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry raised the issue with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Monday, the ministry said. It was agreed that ""no further recruitment from Sri Lanka will be done"", the ministry said. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Nine Hindu pilgrims killed in bus attack in India's Jammu,10 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggm5j0lzzo,"Nine people have died and 33 injured after suspected militants fired on a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims in the Indian federal territory of Jammu and Kashmir, police officials said. Officials had initially said after the incident on Sunday that the death toll was 10, but revised the figure later. They said that the driver lost control after the attack, causing the bus to plunge into a gorge in Reasi district of Jammu. While rescue operations have concluded, a search operation by the Indian army and police is under way to track down the attackers.  Officials said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken ""stock of the situation"" and asked for the best medical care to be provided to the injured. ""All those behind this heinous act will be punished soon,"" Manoj Sinha, the region's top administrator, wrote on X (formerly Twitter). Mr Sinha has announced a compensation of 1m rupees ($12000; £9400) to the next of kin of the deceased and 50,000 rupees to the injured. The bus was on its way to the base camp of the famous Hindu shrine of Mata Vaishno Devi when it was fired upon. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack yet but Mohita Sharma, the district police chief, told Reuters that suspected militants had ""ambushed the bus"". The Himalayan region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for over six decades. Since 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two wars over the Muslim-majority territory, which both claim in full but control in part. Since 1989, Indian-administered Kashmir has also seen an armed insurgency against Delhi's rule, claiming thousands of lives. Delhi accuses Islamabad of harbouring militants and disrupting peace in the region, a charge Pakistan denies. The news of the attack broke as Mr Modi took oath as India's prime minister for the third consecutive term at a swearing-in ceremony in Delhi. On Monday, the Jammu police released the names of the victims, including the driver of the bus. They are from the states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Two of the victims are children, aged two years and 14. Some survivors spoke to ANI news agency about their ordeal. One of them said the driver had been shot and that the firing didn't stop even after the bus fell into the gorge. Amit Shah, who was home minister in Mr Modi's previous government, expressed grief over the incident. ""The culprits of this dastardly attack will not be spared and will face the wrath of the law,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Rahul Gandhi, the leader of main opposition party Congress, questioned the security situation in the region. ""This shameful incident is the true picture of the worrying security situation in Jammu and Kashmir,"" he wrote on X. In 2017, seven Hindu pilgrims, six of them women, were killed after their bus, returning from the famed Amarnath pilgrimage site in Anantnag district, got caught in a gun battle between police and militants.

bbc,Narendra Modi sworn in for third term at grand ceremony in Delhi,9 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggnm7r75yo,"Narendra Modi has been sworn in as India's prime minister for a third term in a grand ceremony at the presidential palace in Delhi. The leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party took his oath, saying he would ""do right to all manner of people without affection or ill-will"". Mr Modi's BJP-led National Democratic Alliance won the general election with 293 seats, a much lower margin than predicted by exit polls. The election saw a resurgence of India's opposition, which won 234 seats. Thousands of guests have been attending his inauguration at Delhi's presidential palace. Among them are the heads of neighbouring Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives - but not Pakistan or China. Tight security has been in place in Delhi, which was declared a no-fly zone, with more than 2,500 police officers deployed around the venue. Speaking as he was sworn in by President Draupadi Murmu, Mr Modi said he would uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India and govern with ""true faith and allegiance to the constitution"". He said: ""I will do right to all manner of people in accordance with the constitution and the law without fear or favour."" A council of ministers of Mr Modi's new cabinet were also sworn in during the ceremony. Mr Modi, 73, is only the second Indian leader to win a third consecutive term after the country’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Exit polls had projected outright victory for his Hindu Nationalist BJP party, which ruled India for a decade, but it lost its parliamentary majority in the general election. His NDA bloc relied on two key allies, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the Janata Dal (United) JD(U), to cross the 272-seat mark needed to form the government. On Friday, the elected MPs voted Mr Modi as the leader of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the parliament), leader of the BJP parliamentary party, and leader of the NDA. It is not clear what concessions his allies may have negotiated in return for their support. India media report that several are seeking key ministerial posts. The opposition INDIA alliance, led by the Congress party, has called the election a mandate against Mr Modi's government. Mr Modi, however, countered this on Friday, saying: ""Opposition tried to paint 2024 Lok Sabha results as a loss for us. But we didn’t lose, we never lost, we will never lose."" Mr Modi thanked voters for their mandate, and said he would ""do everything"" to eradicate corruption and poverty. ""Empowering the poor and middle class is our priority,"" he said. During his election campaign, Mr Modi and his party were accused by critics of using hate speech, attacking the country's Muslim minority, and jailing opposition figures. On Friday, the prime minister-elect said the NDA alliance was ""committed to the principle of ""sarva panth sambhava"" (religious equality). The INDIA alliance has said it will fulfil its duty in parliament by holding the government in check and protecting the constitution. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Will coalition turn domineering Modi into a humbler leader?,9 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn00xl6n8ldo,"India is no stranger to coalition governments. Some of the world’s largest coalitions, comprising between six and a dozen parties, have been formed in the world's most populous democracy. From 1989 to 2004, six general elections produced no single-party majority. Some of these coalitions have been particularly chaotic: between 1989 and 1999, eight were formed and many quickly collapsed. But some of India’s most significant economic reforms and highest growth rates have come under coalition governments, led by both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Now, for the first time since 2014, India will have a coalition government, with no single-party majority. Narendra Modi of the BJP, set for a third term as prime minister, has seen his majority reduced by a resurgent opposition, and now primarily relies on two allies in his National Democratic Alliance (NDA) for a parliamentary majority. But will Mr Modi, who always ruled with a majority as chief minister of Gujarat state and as India’s prime minister, and dominated politics for a decade, be able to run a coalition? Can he shed his domineering style and carry disparate regional allies along? And will he curb a growing personality cult stoked by his party and a friendly media to adopt a more consensual, humbler image? Many believe it's unlikely to be smooth sailing for Mr Modi in a coalition. The two allies that Mr Modi is most dependent on are two regional parties, Janata Dal (United) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP). They have 28 seats between them. Both are led by veteran, astute leaders - Nitish Kumar and N Chandrababu Naidu, respectively - who have previously served in BJP-led federal coalition governments and then quit over differences with the ruling party, specifically over Mr Modi. In 2019, while serving as Andhra Pradesh chief minister, Mr Naidu labeled Mr Modi, then his political rival, a ""terrorist"". Politics makes for strange bedfellows - India is no stranger to that fact. Coalition governments dependent on just two or three allies are particularly vulnerable to collapse if even one withdraws support. Many believe a coalition government under Mr Modi could contribute to a healthier democracy. They say it could reduce the prime minister's dominance, decentralise governance, increase checks and balances, embolden the opposition, and make institutions like the bureaucracy, judiciary and media more independent. Atal Behari Vajpayee, one of the BJP’s stalwarts, ran a successful multi-party coalition government from 1998 to 2004. The avuncular leader privatised state-owned firms, facilitated foreign investment, built expressways, relaxed trade barriers, and even ignited an IT revolution. He ended a decades-old moratorium on nuclear tests, eased tensions with Pakistan and built closer ties with US. Much of this had to do with Mr Vajpayee’s consensual style. But Mr Modi’s coalition is vastly different from the ones in the past. Despite securing fewer than the 272 seats needed for a majority government, the BJP still took 240 seats, so remains an influential and dominant coalition leader. And in the past, successful minority governments have been run with even less seats. Congress were able to run a successful minority government with 232 seats in 1991- and with just 145 and 206 seats in 2004 and 2009. Furthermore, Mr Modi leads an aggressive and revamped BJP. Amit Shah, his closest confidant, embodies a redefined top leadership that Congress leader Shashi Tharoor characterises as a ""my way or the highway"" approach to governance. In the past, BJP-led coalitions put the party’s key ideological and polarising issues on the backburner to accommodate the demands of their allies. Much of the party's agenda – revoking the autonomy of Kashmir, building the Ram temple – has already been achieved under Mr Modi's leadership. Will his allies now urge him to tone down his divisive rhetoric, particularly against Muslims, which he used freely during the election campaign? Effective coalition politics demands collective action to function as a bloc and offer checks and balances. The key question now is what major issues the coalition partners and the BJP can agree upon. Mr Modi’s party has been pushing for a controversial plan to hold simultaneous federal and state elections, something India gave up in 1967. His party has also promised an Uniform Civil Code or UCC, a single personal law for all citizens, irrespective of religion, sex, gender and sexual orientation. This has been resisted in the past by both the country’s majority Hindus and minority Muslims. Then there’s the delicate issue of redrawing of parliamentary boundaries, due after 2026. The wealthier, less populated southern states fear that Mr Modi will expand parliament, with the seat count favouring the poorer, more populous Hindi heartland states - a traditional BJP stronghold. Mr Modi will also have to listen to regional and state-specific demands from the allies and accommodate their leaders' ambitions. Both the TDP and JD(U) have demanded special status for their states, which mean more federal funds. The allies, according to media reports, are also eyeing influential ministries. Despite a rebounding economy fuelled by government spending, Mr Modi needs to create more jobs and boost incomes for the poor and middle class. India’s economy requires many structural reforms in agriculture, land and labour. Mr Modi may need a consultative approach with allies to achieve any of this. For a man used to basking in the spotlight, consensual politics may not come easily to Mr Modi, many believe. ""He has suddenly been asked to enact a role that he has never done before in his life,"" says Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a biographer of the prime minister . But successful politicians master the art of reinvention. Will India now see a humbler, more consultative and consensual Mr Modi? “We will have to wait and see,” says Sandeep Shastri, a political analyst. “We have to view this through the lens of current circumstances, not past alliances.” Watch this space.

bbc,The temple storming still affecting Sikhs today,8 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw99rgv397go,"Members of the Sikh community have been recalling what their families endured during one of the most brutal periods in the history of their faith. It is 40 years since Indian armed forces stormed the Golden Temple in Amritsar in Punjab, to remove Sikh separatists who were demanding an independent homeland, called Khalistan. About 400 people, including 87 soldiers, were killed during Operation Blue Star, which was ordered by then prime minister, Indira Gandhi. But Sikh groups dispute this figure, claiming thousands died. Sikhs across the world accused troops of desecrating the faith's holiest shrine, and tensions led to an armed insurgency lasting more than a decade. Here, Sikhs in Bedfordshire recount how the events of June 1984 have left lasting scars. Rasal Singh is a volunteer in the Sikh temple in Luton, and runs a business in Bedfordshire. His father, Nirmal Singh Chola Sahib, was killed in November 1990. He said: ""My father was arrested and taken to the local police station where he was tortured severely... It was tragic, he was brutally tortured."" The father of three said his family ""still suffer today"". ""The pain is still so raw, the absence of my father has left a void that never truly heals he was tortured and killed, it’s left a huge hole in my heart,"" he said. ""After my dad was killed, my family became homeless, moving from place to place. Even after 40 years, my family is still hurting, and no justice has been served. ""I channel my pain into being a better parent, hoping to give them the sense of completeness that I missed. ""Every hug, every word of encouragement, every moment spent with them is a step towards healing."" Gurjit Singh, from Luton, said his uncle, Paramjit Singh, was a police officer in Punjab before he was killed in the 1990s. He said: ""Innocent people were often tortured and targeted simply for wearing turbans or having beards. ""The police frequently harassed women under false pretences."" He said his uncle became a target for harassment himself while trying to protect a group of women from his colleagues. ""They even targeted his family, including my father, who was also a police officer,"" he said. ""My uncle had to flee the village, but eventually, they found him, tortured him in jail for 10 days, and then killed him in the fields, staging his death as an escape attempt."" He said that his uncle fled, the whole family was arrested, including children and grandparents. One family member was nine months' pregnant and was denied medical care, suffering a stillbirth. “Today after 40 years of fighting for justice, we still don’t have it,"" Mr Singh said. ""Even political parties did not intervene. ""Punjab was in a state of lawlessness and danger. Our family has been shattered, and three generations have been unable to live a normal life."" Harjinder Singh, from Bedford is a Sikh Activist for Sovereign Roots. The campaign group provides education toolkits on the Sikh religion and political history of Punjab from the times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. He said: ""As we mark 40 years since the tragic attack on Sri Darbar Sahib in Amritsar, we remember the thousands of lives lost, including men, women, and children. ""An entire generation has been killed, leaving families and the global Sikh community in enduring pain. ""Today, we find ourselves with no refuge or voice to hear our pleas for justice. The memories of our lost loved ones demand that we seek an independent country, free from the oppression we have faced in India."" Follow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

bbc,India opposition accuses Modi of 'stock market scam',7 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cekkddndldeo,"Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has demanded an investigation into a stock market crash that hit investors at the end of the general election. He accused top Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders of making misleading predictions about stock prices surging after 4 June, the day the results were announced. Mr Gandhi, from the Congress party, claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi encouraged people to buy stocks before this, which led to them losing money when the market crashed. Mr Modi's party, the BJP, has denied the allegations. Mr Gandhi has demanded that a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigate the alleged scam and the role of Mr Modi and senior ministers. He alleged that weeks before election results, Mr Modi, ex-Home Minister Amit Shah, and former Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman advised people to ""buy stocks before 4 June"", suggesting that the market would surge after, anticipating a BJP victory. In May, Mr Shah told NDTV news channel in an interview: ""Stock market crashes should not be linked with elections, but even if such a rumour has been spread, I suggest that you buy (shares) before 4 June. It will shoot up."" Mr Gandhi has labelled it ""the biggest scam"" in India's stock market history, alleging that the manipulation benefited certain ""dubious foreign investors"", causing Indians to lose trillions of rupees. Mr Modi's departing trade minister, Piyush Goyal, has refuted the allegations, accusing Mr Gandhi of misleading investors. Exit polls had predicted that the BJP would comfortably win a majority - securing more than 272 seats in the 543 member parliament - while together with its alliance partners, this figure would touch 360-370. However, the results were drastically different from these predictions, with the BJP failing to reach the halfway mark on its own and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) getting just 293 seats. Mr Gandhi has now claimed that the exit polls were ""fake"" and that the BJP knew that it was not going to win more that 220 seats ""from its internal survey and the feedback from the intelligence agencies"". ""Despite that, the exit polls were made to show that the BJP was winning a large number of seats,"" Mr Gandhi alleged. This, he alleged, led to massive buying of stocks on 3 June. When the results came out the next day, the Indian stock market saw one of its worst crashes in years, with investments worth billions of dollars being wiped out. The BJP's Mr Goyal said that it was Indians who gained from the rise and fall in stock prices, since in April and May, when the market was on an upswing, foreign investors had sold shares which Indians had bought. And this happened again on 4 June, when the market crashed, he said. ""So foreigners bought at a high price and sold at a low price. Indian investors sold at a high price and bought at a low price. So in a way, Indian investors earned even in this period. No one suffered a loss,"" he said. On Friday, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that Mr Goyal's explanation was ""rubbish"" and added that it did not answer specific questions raised by Mr Gandhi. The BJP has not responded to Mr Ramesh's allegations. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,India’s opposition looked down and out – now they’re back,5 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp00jze920eo,"The results of India’s general election announced on Tuesday are being interpreted in a rather unusual way. While the winners appear subdued, the runners-up are celebrating. The NDA alliance, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has won a historic third term in power, with more than 290 seats in the 543-member parliament. But his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on its own did not reach the magic figure of 272 seats needed to form the government – and the prime minister is now being seen as a much diminished leader. The outcome is being seen as a huge comeback for the opposition INDIA alliance and Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi, the face of the bloc. The alliance has won just over 230 seats and doesn’t have the numbers to cobble together a government – but more than 24 hours after counting of votes began, they were yet to concede. “It’s an extraordinary story,” political analyst Rashid Kidwai told the BBC. “The result is surprising. The opposition has managed to pull off the unexpected.” A jubilant Congress party called the verdict “a moral and political defeat for Mr Modi"", whose BJP had campaigned predominantly on his name and record. On Tuesday evening, Mr Gandhi told a press conference that “the country has unanimously sent a message to Mr Modi and [Home Minister] Amit Shah that we do not want you”. There’s a backdrop to this exuberance. Going into the election, the opposition seemed in complete disarray and the Congress-led INDIA bloc, made up of more than two dozen disparate regional parties, appeared to be on the verge of imploding. Experts questioned whether it was fit to challenge Mr Modi, who looked unstoppable at the time. And as the election neared, the opposition faced an uphill battle. Parties and leaders were raided by government agencies; two chief ministers – including Arvind Kejriwal of Delhi – were jailed; and bank accounts belonging to Congress were frozen by the income-tax authorities. The credit for the opposition’s performance, Mr Kidwai says, largely goes to Mr Gandhi, the much criticised scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. His great-grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru was the first and longest-serving prime minister of India. His grandmother and father also served as PM. “He’s a fifth generation dynast and came with a lot of historical baggage,” the political analyst explains. “The mainstream media in India was very hostile to him and social media didn’t take him seriously. He was targeted and projected as a non-serious politician who took too many holidays.” But, Mr Kidwai says, he overcame the odds and, in recent years, has worked hard to change that impression of himself and his party. “During his Bharat Jodo Yatra and the Nyay March through the length and breadth of the country, he met millions of people – which added to his stature and won him lots of support. It also gave him confidence and political heft.” But Mr Gandhi was still not perceived as a threat to Mr Modi. Last year, a court in Mr Modi’s home state Gujarat convicted the Congress leader of defamation. He was thrown out of parliament and barred from contesting elections – until the Supreme Court suspended his conviction. The perception that the BJP was seeking to go after the opposition, says political analyst and author Ajoy Bose, backfired. “The BJP got a bit arrogant and complacent. But their shock and awe tactics to intimidate the opposition worked against the BJP and led to the formation of the INDIA bloc.” The parties, he says, “were afraid they would be wiped off and many saw echoes of Emergency [a reference to the 1975 action of then-PM Indira Gandhi to suspend elections and curb civil rights] in the way the government was functioning”. India has “a history of competitive democracy”, Mr Bose says, adding that among the people “there was a sense of disquiet and discomfort about the country turning into a one-party dictatorship”. As the results show, the BJP juggernaut met strong resistance in several opposition-ruled states. In Tamil Nadu, the ruling DMK party kept the BJP out by winning all 39 seats in the state. In West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee fought to limit the BJP to 12 seats (Mr Modi’s party had won 18 of the 42 seats in 2019). In Maharashtra, the BJP was limited to nine seats – it had won 23 of the 48 seats in 2019 and its then-ally Shiv Sena had bagged a further 18. But the biggest upset for Mr Modi and the BJP, Mr Bose says, came from the bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh (UP). “Akhilesh Yadav and his Samajwadi Party (SP) is the biggest success story of this election. A very clever alliance with Rahul Gandhi won them 43 of the state’s 80 seats. The BJP’s tally has been restricted to a poor 33.” Mr Modi's party won 62 seats in 2019 and took 71 in 2014. In the run-up to the election, Mr Modi had described Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav as “a pair of boys” whose alliance had “flopped” many times in the past. But as the results show, this pair of boys soundly beat the BJP in UP. “A key takeaway from the election,” Mr Bose says, “is that the grand new Ram temple in Ayodhya city wasn’t enough for the BJP to win.” The party had banked on the Ram Mandir temple to be their trump card, with Mr Modi presiding over the opening of the unfinished temple in Ayodhya with much fanfare in January. But in the Faizabad constituency, where it is located, the BJP candidate lost. Abhishek Yadav, an SP youth-wing leader and a star campaigner for his party, told the BBC that initially they too believed that the temple would help the BJP win the key state. “Until early April, [the] election in the state had seemed like a one-sided contest with the odds stacked against us,” Mr Yadav told me recently. “But we sensed there was an undercurrent of resentment against the BJP when large numbers of people started gathering at our rallies.” People were unhappy about a lack of jobs and high food and fuel prices, he said. Many were also angry with the changes in how army soldiers are recruited. “With the Congress and SP fighting the election together as part of INDIA alliance, all anti-BJP voters came together to vote for us,” he added. Mr Kidwai says that – notwithstanding the surprisingly good performance of the opposition – in some ways, it was a missed opportunity, as the INDIA bloc failed to read the voters’ minds and did not sense the disquiet they felt with Mr Modi’s government. “They spoke about joblessness, rural economic distress and were able to win over many voters – but there were lots of gaps in their strategy,” he says. “The NDA’s third term has come only because of weaknesses in the INDIA bloc. They could have forged alliances in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and that would have made their tally stronger.” But now that the NDA – and Mr Modi – are back in power, INDIA needs to institutionalise its alliance and Mr Gandhi, “the chief architect of the alliance”, must lead from the front, Mr Kidwai adds. “It’s unlikely that the government will stop going after the opposition. But it also can’t be business as usual for the government. They cannot continue with their politics of vendetta; it will have to be toned down. “The strength of opposition in parliament would allow restoration of functional ties in parliament. There’s great need for coalition politics now. And Congress as the single largest opposition party in the coalition must lead from the front. “The Gandhis consider themselves as trustees of power, not power-wielders. But now the time has come to change. Rahul Gandhi has to take on the mantle of leadership and lead.” Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Full report: Stunning blow for Modi as alliance heads for reduced majority,4 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vv93pz14zo,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has claimed a historic third win in a row in the country's parliamentary elections, but his ruling alliance appears to have failed to win a large majority as predicted. He thanked voters and said he would continue the ""good work"" of the last decade. Mr Modi’s BJP-led alliance is leading in more than 290 of 543 seats up for grabs, well short of their target of 400. The Congress and other allied opposition parties have surprised observers, and are now expected to win more than 230. The results give the lie to a slew of exit polls at the weekend that showed the BJP-led NDA alliance on course for a super majority of two-thirds of parliament, which would have allowed it to make changes to the constitution.  In his first remarks since the election, though, the prime minister was keen to stress his historic third victory. ""I bow to the people for this affection and assure them that we will continue the good work done in the last decade to keep fulfilling the aspirations of people,"" he said on X. Speaking to supporters later, he described his victory as ""the biggest in the world"" and said he was ""very very happy today"". But Rahul Gandhi - leader of the opposition Congress party - told reporters  that Mr Modi and the BJP had been ""punished"" by voters at the ballot box. Analysts attribute the BJP's setback to rising prices, joblessness, a controversial army recruitment reform and Mr Modi's aggressive and divisive campaign, which may have alienated voters in parts of the country. Mr Modi had set a target of 370 seats for the BJP and 400 seats for his alliance. This was up from the 303 seats won by the BJP alone in the last general election in 2019. However, the BJP is no longer expected to get the 272 seats on its own that are needed for a majority in the lower house of parliament. This is a setback for the party and means - for the first time - Mr Modi would have to rely on smaller parties in the NDA  to push through its agenda. There has been speculation that Mr Gandhi might also try to form a government, but two key NDA parties have already pledged their support for the incumbent prime minister. Some of the major developments of the election include:  The election was seen by many as a referendum on Mr Modi's decade in office, during which he has transformed many aspects of life in India, so this would be a major upset. The mood in BJP offices around the country has been described by BBC reporters as ""sombre"". In contrast, at Congress headquarters, party workers have been celebrating. The Indian markets, meanwhile, have been showing jitters - falling more than 2% - testifying to the fact that it’s not been a runaway result so far for the governing alliance. An average 66% of voters took part in the election, official figures showed. It was the biggest such exercise the world has ever seen, with nearly a billion registered voters – about one in eight of the global population. Voting was staggered over seven rounds between 19 April and 1 June for security and logistical reasons. Much of the election took place in extreme and deadly heat as temperatures in parts of India soared to nearly 50C. The BJP and its rivals fought a fierce - at times vitriolic - campaign, with the prime minister denying that he was being divisive when he was accused by rivals of demonising Muslims. Mr Modi toured the country, pointing to his achievements in areas such as delivering welfare schemes and raising India’s global profile. Opposition parties highlighted cost of living issues, high unemployment - especially for young people - and fears that constitutional changes could disempower the disadvantaged. They also promised to stop India’s “slide into autocracy”. A number of opposition leaders and government critics have been jailed in recent years, including Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal who was taken into custody on corruption charges in April but later briefly released to allow him to campaign.

bbc,BBC India reporters on why some voters said no to Modi,4 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5113nvjevxo,"When Narendra Modi set his sights on a barnstorming victory - 400 out of 543 seats  for his alliance - few scoffed at the ambition. After all, the Indian prime minister and his BJP have been a largely unstoppable force since coming to power a decade ago. But while Mr Modi and his alliance are on course to win a majority, it is not quite the untouchable win he and his allies envisioned when counting began this morning. Below, BBC correspondents in India give their thoughts on why we arrived at results few expected - and what it could mean for the world's largest democracy going forward. Religion is a factor in every Indian election, and this one was no different. Mr Modi inaugurated a Hindu temple at a controversial site that had been disputed between Hindus and Muslims in January and this was expected to give his party a big boost during the election. But no one quite expected the BJP’s campaign to be as polarising as it was - or for some of the most aggressive comments to come from the very top. At a campaign rally in April, Mr Modi said: “When their (the opposition Congress) government was in power they had said Muslims have the first right on the nation’s wealth. This means they’ll collect the wealth and give it to whom? To those who have many children. To infiltrators.” Some analysts interpreted the remark as an attempt by Mr Modi to galvanise his conservative Hindu support base. But looking at the results from some key constituencies – the BJP candidate has lost in the temple city of Ayodhya -  it doesn’t appear to have had the desired effect. Questions are now being raised about using the Hindu card as a campaign tool, especially since what it seems to have achieved is the opposite - uniting Muslim minorities against the BJP. Marketing consultants have attributed Narendra Modi’s enduring popularity to his mastery of branding, transforming routine events into spectacles and astute messaging. “He strikes a deep chord with his aura of clarity and strength, speaks simultaneously to anxieties and aspirations, communicates using emotionally resonant metaphors, understands the power of branding key initiatives to generate a sense of activity and purpose and knows the power of enigmatic silence,” Santosh Desai, a well-known brand consultant, wrote in 2017. Over the years, Mr Modi also sold himself as a cultural icon engaging a diverse people both at home and abroad, cementing his status as an influential leader in Indian politics. A weak opposition and a largely friendly media helped him build his brand.  “He’s pop culture in 70% of this country,” a brand consultant said at a conclave last year. No longer. As results of the general elections show, Brand Modi is beginning to fray. Mr Modi has never underperformed and won less than a majority in all the elections he has fought so far. It has been different this time. Tuesday’s results show that some of the sheen may be wearing off and even Mr Modi is not immune to the vagaries of anti-incumbency. Since the July 2023 formation of the opposition INDIA alliance, a grouping of more than two dozen parties, the Modi-led government has been painting it as a ragtag bunch of self-serving leaders out to personally target Mr Modi and destroy the country. While the leaders of the ruling BJP, along with most analysts and pollsters, had for months been predicting an easy win for Mr Modi, the Congress-led opposition block  kept emphasising rural distress, inflation and rampant unemployment in its messaging and public meetings. ""The Constitution is in danger"" and the country’s “democratic institutions are under attack” under a “divisive” Mr Modi was their war cry. A 4,200 miles (6,700 km) long march by Rahul Gandhi, a senior leader of the Congress party, that began months before the elections was heavily panned for its timing, but analysts believe it enthused supporters and galvanised party cadres. The opposition also upped its social media reach and aggressively took on the BJP which has for a long time dominated the digital landscape in India. Mr Modi's BJP is still struggling to make a major impact in southern India, although its vote share is set to increase. It won 25 seats in Karnataka alone in 2019. But this time it is losing at least 10 seats in the same state to the Congress party. It is on the verge of doubling the four seats it won in Telangana and a couple of seats in Andhra Pradesh because of its alliance with the regional Telugu Desam Party, headed by the IT industry friendly Chandrababu Naidu. In Tamil Nadu, the regional DMK led alliance is on the verge of repeating its 2019 performance of a clean sweep. And in Kerala, the Communist government and the Congress-led front seem to have kept the BJP from the Lok Sabha. In short, the development focused welfare schemes of the non-BJP parties appear to be making a better connect with the aspirations of the voters down South. Mr Modi projected himself as the voice of the Global South – a leader who acted as a bridge between the developing and the developed world. The Indian PM’s global heft was grounded in the massive support he had at home. He provided a sense of continuity to global leaders and alliances. Mr Modi will now head a coalition government. He is likely to have bipartisan support on foreign policy, but he will have to take allies into confidence before taking crucial decisions that affect global politics. That might force him to slow down, and adopt a more consultative decision making policy. So far India has defiantly practised its policy of strategic autonomy in foreign affairs, and that might not change. But what will change is Mr Modi’s ability to take quick decisions on global affairs – something he often did without consulting his own allies or the opposition. Be it as Gujarat state chief minister or as prime minister in his last two terms, Narendra Modi has run a full majority BJP government. Coalition partners did come along to give a hand, but the government’s future was never in their hands. Current numbers clearly indicate the BJP is falling short of majority which means Mr Modi will seek support from allies. He has got used to running a centralised government and party under him which will have to change keeping the new reality in mind. He will need to be a lot more mindful of the concerns and sensitivities of coalition partners and that doesn’t come easy to him, one analyst noted. India is not new to coalition politics, but coalition governments are often prone to instability. So it would be a litmus test for both Mr Modi and the BJP over their adaptability to a changed scenario. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Heat kills more than 50 people in India in three days,3 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cprrv9zp8wyo,"More than 50 people have died in India over the past three days as a brutal heat spell continues to grip parts of the country. Around 33 people died in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh over the weekend due to the heat. These included people involved in the general election, including polling officials, security guards and sanitation staff - Saturday was the last phase of voting. In Odisha (Orissa) state, about 20 people died due to heat stroke, officials said. Every five years, India holds its general election in the summer months of April and May. But this year, the temperatures have been record-breaking, with the country experiencing frequent, more intense and longer heatwaves. The federal health ministry says that there have been at least 56 confirmed heat strokes deaths from 1 March to 30 May. About 24,849 heatstroke cases were reported during the period. However, state-wise figures suggest the actual number could be much higher. In Odisha, district authorities reported 99 suspected heat stroke deaths in the past 72 hours - of these, 20 cases have been confirmed, the state's Special Relief Commissioner said in a statement. In Uttar Pradesh, Navdeep Rinwa, chief electoral officer of the state, told reporters that the families of deceased election personnel would be given a monetary compensation of 1.5m rupees ($18,000; £14,000). Mr Rinwa said that a man who was standing in the queue to vote fainted because of the heat. “The voter was transported to a health facility, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival,” he said. Suspected heat-related deaths have also been reported from the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. India's National Centre for Disease Control calls heat strokes a ""life-threatening"" condition with a mortality rate of 40-64%. The heat in northern and central India and parts of the west has been unrelenting for the past two weeks, with maximum temperatures hovering around 45-46C for days at a stretch and even climbing up to 50C in some areas. However, India's weather department says that temperatures are likely to fall in the coming days due to the onset on the monsoon. Several regions are experiencing severe water and electricity shortages due to a rise in power consumption. Videos from capital Delhi show people jostling for water from water tankers. Many parts of the capital are also experiencing frequent power cuts. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,"India's Modi could win third term, polls predict",1 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgllg541xmxo,"India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to win a third consecutive term in office, exit polls suggest. Analysts warn the polls, released by various news agencies, have often been wrong in the past and are not impartial. However, they have placed Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as the frontrunner in the general election. The BJP, the main opposition Congress party and regional rivals battled it out in a fierce campaign over seven phases of polling. Results will be announced on 4 June. A party or coalition needs 272 seats in parliament to form a government. The BJP led-coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), will cross this target - according to exit polls, which forecast it being close to taking about two-thirds of the seats. In his first comments after voting ended, Mr Modi claimed victory without referring to the exit polls. ""I can say with confidence that the people of India have voted in record numbers to re-elect the NDA government,"" he wrote on X, without providing evidence of his claim. Prime Minister Modi came into this election with resounding popularity, but his main rival - the leader of the Indian National Congress, Rahul Gandhi - and a coalition of opposition parties gathered significant momentum through the course of the lengthy election campaign. Now an aggregate of six exit polls forecasts big wins for the BJP-led NDA, but such surveys are not always reliable. Though the individual numbers vary, they predict that the NDA will get between 355 and 380 seats. The INDIA bloc is expected to get between 125 and 165 seats, according to the Reuters news agency. On its own, the BJP may win about 327 seats, not quite meeting its 370-seat target. India is the world's most populous country, with 1.4 billion people, and holding a nationwide election is nothing short of a Herculean task. Some 969 million citizens were eligible to cast their ballot, which is equal to the populations of the US, Russia, Japan, Britain, Brazil, France and Belgium. Polling for the election, which concluded just hours ago, began on 19 April. The season was marked by fiery speeches by politicians (some of them controversial), numerous rallies, diatribes, jibes and propaganda as political parties looked to outsmart their opponents - on the ground and even online. And there wasn't a dearth of headline-making incidents. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's arrest in a liquor policy case days before polling began drew sharp criticism from opposition leaders and even sections of the media. Opposition leaders accused the BJP government of trying to silence rivals and deny them a level playing field - which the BJP denies. A court granted Mr Kejriwal bail on 10 May to campaign for the elections. However, he has to return to jail on 2 June. The election was also overshadowed by reports of politicians and party workers tampering with voting machines, Muslims being denied their right to vote in some areas and parties flouting the Model Code of Conduct - guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India (ECI) to ensure free and fair elections. Opposition leaders also accused the commission of not acting on their complaints against the BJP - an allegation the ECI has denied. The inauguration of the Ram temple, which was one of the BJP's biggest poll promises this election, and the government's welfare schemes are expected to benefit the ruling party. But the high unemployment rate and price rises, especially of food and fuel, were also at the top of many voters' minds. The election also came amid allegations from the opposition, activists and global rights organisations that Indian democracy is under threat. It is an issue that may have influenced the way people cast their votes. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Heat kills at least 15 in India as temperatures near 50C,31 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czddy30ezd5o,"Several people have died due to heat-related ailments over the past 24 hours as temperatures continue to soar in northern and central India. Ten fatalities were recorded at the government hospital in Odisha's Rourkela region on Thursday, authorities told Reuters news agency. Heat-stroke related deaths have also been reported from the states of Bihar, Rajasthan and Jharkhand and the national capital, Delhi. The searing heat comes as India is holding its general election, the results of which will be declared on 4 June. Mahendra Kumar, district magistrate of Bhojpur district in Bihar told the Times of India newspaper that three election officers and a policeman had died in the city on Thursday due to heat stroke. ""It was the hottest day, and despite having medical facilities at all centres, they collapsed. One home guard [volunteer policeman] became unconscious where he was staying,""  Mr Kumar said, adding that the man died in the hospital while being treated by doctors. He also said that around 30-40 people had been admitted to the same hospital on Thursday due to heat-related ailments. Hospitals in the region are recording a rise in admissions due to heat-related ailments. On Thursday, a labourer admitted with a heat stroke died while receiving treatment at a hospital in Delhi. India's National Centre for Disease Control calls heat strokes a ""life-threatening"" condition with a mortality rate of 40 to 64%. The heat in northern, central and parts of western India has been unrelenting for the past two weeks, with maximum temperatures hovering around 45-46C for days at a stretch and even climbing up to 50C in some areas. Several regions are experiencing severe water and electricity shortages due to a rise in consumption. The soaring temperatures have led to a surge in fires across India and  authorities are employing drones to monitor forest fires in Jammu and Kashmir. In the past week, capital Delhi and surrounding regions experienced record-breaking temperatures nearing 50C. Videos of residents in Delhi jostling for water from water tankers have been widely shared on social media. Many parts of the capital are also experiencing frequent power cuts. Officials are still investigating whether the recorded temperature of 52.9C in the Mungeshpur area on Wednesday was a result of a sensor malfunction at the nearby weather station. India saw a 55% rise in deaths due to extreme heat between 2000-2004 and 2017-2021, a study published in the medical journal, The Lancet, found. Exposure to heat also caused a loss of 167.2 billion potential labour hours among Indians in 2021, the study noted. While many parts of the country have regularly experienced heatwaves in summer, experts have said these are now becoming longer, more intense and frequent. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,India MP arrested in sex-abuse case upon return to country,31 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clkkzx1zyejo,"Police in India have arrested a lawmaker who fled the country after being accused of sexually abusing several women. Prajwal Revanna, who left India on 27 April, was arrested on his arrival from Germany in the southern city of Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) early on Friday. Mr Revanna has denied all the allegations against him. The 33-year-old MP belongs to the Janata Dal (Secular) party, which is an ally of PM Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party. Mr Revanna, who belongs to an influential political family, is seeking re-election from the Hassan constituency in the southern state of Karnataka. But shortly before voting in Hassan, thousands of USB sticks with videos of the MP allegedly abusing women circulated in Karnataka, sparking outrage. Mr Revanna did not comment on the videos, but an official from his office said that the videos had been doctored. He fled the country shortly after voting ended in his constituency. Reports say the police have registered three cases of sexual assault against the MP so far. A special police team set up by Karnataka Chief Minister K Siddaramaiah is investigating the cases. On 18 May, a special court had issued an arrest warrant against Mr Revanna, following an application moved by the special investigation team (SIT). Days before he was arrested, Mr Revanna had applied for anticipatory bail but a court on Thursday rejected his plea. After remaining missing for several weeks, Mr Revanna had released a video on 27 May in which he said that he would appear before the SIT on Friday. The video came out shortly after his grandfather, former Indian prime minister HD Deve Gowda, asked him to return to India and face the investigation. Mr Revanna's father, HD Revanna and uncle HD Kumaraswamy are both influential legislators in the Karnataka state assembly. HD Revanna is also accused of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation in a police complaint lodged by a former employee of the family. He was held for six days but freed on bail last month. He has also denied the allegations, calling them a political conspiracy. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,The Indian women trumpeting their caste on Instagram,31 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrrq9e2pelo,"Young women in small towns and villages across India are proudly trumpeting their caste identities on Instagram, making it the latest battleground for caste politics. The BBC tracked 100 accounts and spoke to a dozen such influencers across the caste divide to understand what's driving the trend. The camera focuses on a woman in a black dress. She is pointing a rifle at the sky with her hand on the trigger. ""Who are you?"" asks an accompanying voiceover. ""We are Brahmins,"" a voice responds. The woman smiles, and the sound of two gunshots is heard. This is just one of hundreds of Instagram Reels made by Shivi Dikshit, a 24-year-old from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh who shares short videos about her Brahmin caste with her 150,000 followers on Instagram. Hinduism's deeply hierarchical caste system, which dates back at least 3,000 years, puts Brahmins or priests at the top and Dalits (formerly untouchables) at the bottom. Caste-based discrimination has been illegal in India for decades, but the country's 200 million Dalits continue to find themselves among the most marginalised citizens. Despite reforms, caste also remains a strong marker of identity in everyday conversations in many parts of the country. In the videos, which are shot at home and have more than a million views, Ms Dikshit talks about the ""superiority"" of Brahmins as she pours scorn on the notion of inter-caste relations and rejects affirmative policies aimed at empowering Dalits. ""Brahmins have a cultural upbringing [unlike other caste groups]. Everyone in my family is a practising priest. I want to propagate the values we practice and dispel myths about my community,"" she tells me while sitting on the terrace of her family-owned temple in the northern town of Meerut. Ms Dikshit is among the thousands of Indian women who are using Instagram to talk about their caste in new and imaginative ways. Most of them are from small towns and villages - unusual in a country where, unlike men, very few women speak publicly about their religious and caste identities. But access to social media, they say, has given them a platform to freely express themselves and challenge patriarchal controls. A study done by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) between 2014 and 2019 notes there has been a ""democratisation of the social media space"" in India, especially among the ""less educated and those living in rural areas"". And it's not just women from privileged castes - the strident views of those like Ms Dikshit have met a fightback from the Dalit community. Seemi Milind Jadhav, a 22-year-old beautician, goes by the name Bhimachi Sherni on Instagram. It's a reference to Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, a Dalit icon and the architect of India's constitution, while Sherni means lioness in Urdu. ""I look upon Ambedkar as a father figure. So, I am my father's lioness,"" she says. Ms Jadhav, who lives on the outskirts of India's financial capital Mumbai, says she began making Reels after coming across ""myths and disinformation being spread by upper-caste handles on Instagram"". ""I started educating myself about Ambedkar's teachings and caste politics, slowly I found a whole community of like-minded Dalits online,"" she told me. ""We now brainstorm and come up with our own Reels in response."" Most of the women the BBC spoke to said they made their online debut on the Chinese app TikTok and moved to Instagram after India banned it in 2020. The content they share is wide-ranging, but recurring themes include descriptions of ""the ideal"" Brahmin or Dalit man and a strong rejection of inter-caste marriages. These opinions can seem contrarian to a modern image of India - but data shows it's not uncommon. A Pew Research Center survey in 2019-2020 had more than 60% of respondents say it was important to stop both men and women in their community from marrying into other castes. These influencers also highlight the fault lines in a country marked by religious and social divisions. Brahmin women speak of uniting Brahmins and the Hindu community to contribute ""to the building of the Hindu nation"". But Dalit women like Ms Jadhav oppose the idea. They say if that happens, the strides the community has made in accessing education, employment and a life of dignity will be halted, pushing Dalits back to the margins. Hilal Ahmed, an assistant professor at CSDS, says the trend shows how women are rejecting popular assumptions that they are not interested in politics. ""Women are seen as bearers of culture and tradition that are derived from caste and religion,"" he explains. ""It is not surprising that now that they have a medium to express themselves, they want to own those identities and share their opinion about them."" But he adds that in the name of pride, these women are often perpetuating existing social divides. ""It's a paradox. They assert a sense of victimhood that their communities are under threat while also claiming that they don't fear anyone."" Some of the content shared is also provocative, with Reels bordering on hate speech and violence. The BBC contacted Meta about a few such videos, following which the company took them down from the platform. A Meta spokesperson said the company's community standards prohibit content targeting a person or group of people on the basis of their caste which is ""a protected characteristic"". ""Any content that threatens or incites violence is also prohibited,"" the spokesperson added. The women, however, dismiss allegations of casteism and violence and claim they are only trying to unite their community. Samiksha Sharma, who describes herself as Brahmin on Instagram, says she is often accused of ""dividing people"" and receives hostile comments ""However, I don't see it that way,"" the 24-year-old adds. ""I take inspiration from other Brahmin handles and promote our community."" In a country where millions of young adult women cannot even own a mobile phone without their parents' permission, Ms Jadhav says the platform allows her to navigate patriarchy through technology. When she first began making Reels in 2019, she did not tell her parents, recording them secretly at a salon where she worked to support her family. But she says the solidarities she built with women online gave her the courage to tell them the truth and assert her identity. ""They were shocked but proud that I was doing this for the community. So now I don't need to hide."" Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.

bbc,Absconding India MP to return to face sex abuse cases,29 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx99gkpwgq8o,"An Indian lawmaker who fled the country after being accused of sexual assault is set to return this week, more than a month after thousands of USB sticks with videos of the alleged abuse were circulated in his home state. Prajwal Revanna, an MP from Hassan district in Karnataka who is seeking re-election, had left India on 27 April using his diplomatic passport after the videos went viral. This week, he posted a video from an undisclosed location, saying he would return to India on 31 May to appear before a police team investigating the charges. He has denied the allegations of rape and sexual abuse, terming them a “political conspiracy”. Mr Revanna belongs to an influential political family - he is the grandson of former Indian prime minister HD Deve Gowda, who is the leader of the state's politically powerful Vokkaliga community. His Janata Dal (Secular), or JD (S) party, is an ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Prajwal Revanna's father HD Revanna and uncle HD Kumaraswamy are both influential legislators in the Karnataka state assembly. HD Revanna is also accused of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation in the police complaint lodged by a former employee of the family. He was arrested for six days but freed on bail last month. He has also denied the allegations, calling them a political conspiracy. In the past month while Mr Revanna was absent, fear and disquiet have gripped Hassan, which has been a stronghold of his family for decades. “It is too embarrassing to speak about what happened here,” a young shopkeeper in the district told the BBC. Roopa Hassan, a women's rights activist working in the state, says a lot of families have left the district over the past month. ""Many haven't come out of their houses for weeks,"" she said. The allegations against Mr Revanna first came to light in June last year, but he obtained a court order preventing media from reporting what was described as ""morphed videos"". But five days before the 26 April election in Hassan, thousands of pen drives were circulated in public places such as bus stands and parks. They contained 2,960 clips, which reports say were shot by Mr Revanna himself, and showed the faces of the women. On 28 April, one of the survivors lodged a police complaint, accusing Mr Revanna of raping her between 1 January 2021 and 25 April 2024 in his official government bungalow. She alleged that the politician had recorded the assault on his phone and used it to blackmail her and that he threatened her and her husband with a gun if she did not ""obey"" him. Mr Revanna did not address any of these direct allegations in his video. The couple, who said they had been “loyal” JD(S) party workers for decades, have alleged that they were forced to leave Hassan since their police complaint. The state government formed a special investigation team to look into the charges against Mr Revanna after another woman approached the women’s commission with similar accusations. Since then, police have received two more complaints of rape against the MP. On 1 May, Mr Revanna's lawyer told the SIT that he would not be able to participate in the inquiry since he was not in the country. In a social media post the same day, Mr Revanna also sought a week’s time to appear before investigators, saying that the “truth will prevail soon”. But he didn't return to India in a week. In May, the state government wrote to the federal foreign ministry twice, asking it to cancel Mr Revanna’s diplomatic passport. Foreign Minister S Jaishankar responded saying the request had been received late and that action was initiated on the request on 23 May. The case has sparked a political storm in Karnataka with the state's governing Congress party and the opposition blaming each other over who should have taken action against Mr Revanna when the videos surfaced. A state minister accused the BJP of fielding Mr Revanna for the election despite knowing that ""hundreds of women had been abused by the candidate"". Some reports said that the BJP’s state leaders had warned party leaders in Delhi about Mr Revanna's alleged misconduct. Meanwhile in Hassan, people remain reluctant to discuss the case, with two female students called it “disgusting”. “Boys in our college are talking about it. But we feel repulsed and don't even want to listen to what happened,"" one of them said. ""People switch off their TV sets now because they only show this shameful episode,” a resident who did not want to be named said. “We are sick of this. This has given the district such a bad name."" Mr Gowda and Mr Kumaraswamy have distanced themselves from the controversy and made several public appeals for Prajwal Revanna to return to the country. Last week, Mr Kumaraswamy apologised to party workers on behalf of the family. ""Be assured that I shall do everything possible to fight for your cause,"" he said. But a senior JD(S) worker, who wanted to stay anonymous, told the BBC that party workers were “depressed and upset’’ over the allegations. “We were all like an extended family of Mr Deve Gowda,"" she said.

bbc,The Indian state holding the key to PM Modi's re-election,29 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqee449yl5lo,"As India votes to elect a new government, all eyes are on the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, commonly known by its initials UP. Spread over an area roughly the size of Britain, the state packs in nearly four times as many people. With an estimated 257 million people, it is India’s most populous state and would be the fifth largest in the world if it was an independent country after India, China, United States and Indonesia and ahead of Pakistan or Brazil. The state is among just three in India which are voting in all seven phases in the elections which are spread over 44 days. (Voting ends on 1 June and results will be announced on 4 June.) So, it’s no surprise that UP - which elects 80 MPs in the 543-member lower house of parliament (the Lok Sabha) - is considered key to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s re-election bid as he seeks to return for a third consecutive term. “It’s commonly said that ‘the way to Delhi is through UP’ and a party that does well in the state generally goes on to rule India,” says Sharat Pradhan, senior journalist in the state capital, Lucknow. “Eight of India’s former prime ministers,” he adds, “have represented the state and in 2014, when Mr Modi - originally from the western state of Gujarat – made his debut as an MP, he too chose UP.” Mr Modi held his seat in the ancient city of Varanasi in 2019 and aims to do so again this year. So, Mr Modi has been on a whirlwind tour of the state, doing roadshows and addressing rallies – sometimes up to seven in a single day – to convince voters to support his party. He’s set his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a goal of 370 seats - a party needs 272 to win. In 2014, BJP won 71 seats in the state and in 2019, it got 62. This time, party leaders say, they’re aiming for 70 plus – even all of its 80 seats. The maths, the opposition Congress party’s Gaurav Kapoor says, is simple – “a party that wins 70 seats here needs just 202 more to form a government”. Earlier this month, when Mr Modi arrived in the city to file his nomination, accompanied by the state’s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a saffron-robed Hindu monk-turned-politician, thousands of supporters gathered to cheer them on. A truck painted saffron – the colour associated with the BJP – and decorated with marigold flowers carried them as their cavalcade made its way through the narrow streets of the ancient city. Mr Modi waved and held up a replica of the lotus flower – his party symbol – as men and women dressed in saffron clothes and caps raised slogans in support. It’s not just the BJP that’s eyeing the state regarded as “the biggest prize” in Indian election. The Congress, which was dominant in the state for four decades until it was edged out by local parties in 1991, is fighting here in alliance with the regional Samajwadi Party (SP). The alliance has also claimed that “we are winning 79 seats and have a fight in one”. Counting of votes on 4 June is likely to show claims on both sides are exaggerated, but analysts point out that all the elections in the past 10 years in the state have gone in the BJP’s favour. And the upbeat mood at Mr Modi’s roadshow reflected that self-assurance. Most Varanasi residents in the crowd talked about the transformation their city has undergone in the past decade – the new highways that have been built, the expansion of the Kashi-Vishwanath temple and the spruced-up banks of the river Ganges. Watching Mr Modi’s procession from his shop along the route of the roadshow, Ambrish Mittal, a chemist, says “the city roads are cleaner and the long power cuts that plunged the city into darkness for hours are history”. But despite its political significance, UP remains among India's poorest states - though there have been some positive changes in the past few years. Government data shows that millions more now have electricity, access to toilets and are using clean fuel compared to five years ago. But UP still has the largest concentration of poor in the world – with 23% of its population recorded as multidimensionally poor even after tens of millions have been lifted out of poverty. The state also records tens of thousands of violent crimes against women every year and continues to make headlines for cases where the accused are politically influential men. And although these ills have plagued the state historically, opposition parties have seized upon them and been raising them at their campaign rallies as the BJP has been in power nationally for a decade and also ruled UP for seven years now. The huge turnout at their meetings, opposition leaders say, reflects voter disenchantment with the BJP. “Until a few weeks back, election in the state had seemed like a one-sided contest with the odds stacked against us,” says Abhishek Yadav, a Samajwadi Party youth wing leader and a star campaigner for his party. But he feels that the opposition's campaign has gathered pace as unemployment and price rise have become main issues. The BJP claims that a lot of investment now started coming into the state and there’s been an industrial revival, but Gaurav Kapoor of the Congress says the government’s failure to establish any new industry or create jobs has alienated many voters. “Temples are the new industry for Mr Modi. Post-Covid, the only business that has progressed in the state are hotels and restaurants and other things to do with religious tourism. But the youth want jobs.” Ashwani Shahi of the BJP, however, blames opposition parties for everything that’s wrong with the state. “In 2017 when the BJP won UP, we inherited a state which was poor, had high rates of illiteracy and unemployment. We have started work to change that. “But It takes time to uplift people from poverty. I think By 2029, we’ll be able to take 90% people out of poverty.” Mr Shahi admits there is some anti-incumbency, but the BJP will still romp home in Uttar Pradesh – and the rest of India - because of Mr Modi.

bbc,Tackling water shortages with 'Star Wars' tech,28 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11nnwp646o,"When a severe drought hit the Indian city of Kozhikode, also known as Calicut, in 2016, residents including student Swapnil Shrivastav had access to a limited amount of water each day. “We were rationed to two buckets of water a day, which we collected from water tanks,” he says. While he says it’s not uncommon for water supply issues to impact parts of India, it was a tough month for Mr Shrivastav and others in the region. “It was a very humid area; it was unmanageable.” Mr Shrivastav was already interested in water scarcity having won a student competition in 2012 on imagining the future of water in cities, but the experience pushed him to explore solutions. “One element of inspiration was from Star Wars where there’s an air to water device. I thought why don’t we give it a try? It was more of a curiosity project.” Several years later, in 2019, that idea led him, Govinda Balaji and Venkatesh Raja to set up Uravu Labs, a Bangalore-based startup. Their system converts air to water using atmospheric water generators that contain a liquid desiccant, which absorbs moisture from the air. Using sunlight or renewable electricity they heat the desiccant to 65C which releases the moisture, which can then be condensed into drinking water. Mr Shrivastav says the whole process takes about 12 hours. Today each unit produces about 2,000 litres of drinking water. However, while his vision was to supply drinking water to communities facing water shortages, he says it wasn’t financially viable. “We realised the tech still needs more time to scale up and come down in cost,” says Mr Shrivastav. “Or someone should fund it, but we haven’t found the support in India.” Instead, they currently sell the water to 40 clients in the hospitality industry, who in turn use it to provide drinking water for customers. “We tried non-profit and CSR departments [corporate social responsibility]... but many companies shy away from tech. They thought it wouldn’t work. We had to shift to commercial consumption applications as they were ready to pay us and it’s a sustainability driver for them.” Water shortages are not new, but many countries, especially in the global south, are experiencing climate change-related intense drought and flooding that contaminates water sources. More than 50% of the global population – four billion people - experience water shortfalls at least once a month, while by 2025, 1.8 billion people are expected to be living in countries or regions with “absolute” water scarcity, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Could atmospheric water generation technology be the answer? Energy efficient – it can be powered by renewable sources – it’s one way of providing a fresh source of water without the need for traditional water infrastructure, making it an attractive option in remote locations. There appears to be a market for the technology. Valued at $3.4bn (£2.7bn) in 2022, the atmospheric water generation market is expected to be worth $13.5bn in 2032, according to a report by Global Market Insights. There are two main methods for atmospheric water generation. Firstly, there’s the cooling and condensation process which cools humid air to its dew point, causing water vapour to condense into liquid water. The second is a desiccant-based system which uses hygroscopic materials to absorb moisture from the air, then release it through a heating process, he says. Through her social enterprise Majik Water, co-founder and chief executive Beth Koigi manages about 40 atmospheric water generator units across arid and semi-arid regions across Kenya, using a cooling and condensation-based techniques to capture moisture from the air. Founded in 2017, Ms Koigi was inspired to start Majik Water after experiencing water scarcity for the first time during a drought when she was studying in Nairobi in 2016. While many visited a nearby river to fetch water for cooking, drinking and washing, Koigi says she couldn’t bring herself to drink the contaminated water. “It made me realise that you take for granted water as it’s always there.” She started looking for other water source ideas and set up a water filter company before developing an air-to-water system. Majik Water works with NGOs and humanitarian organisations, as well as being sold in stores. Majik's biggest unit produces 500 litres of water in 24 hours and is installed in schools and small communities. While there is demand for her company's system, Ms Koigi does not see it as a permanent solution. “Honestly, I feel like this is not the solution to water scarcity,” says Ms Koigi. “It’s a temporary solution… mostly because it’s not cheap."" Manufacturers are focused on making air-to-water generation systems more energy efficient, says Avinash Singh, associate director of research and consulting at Global Market Insights. “For instance, innovations in compressors, heat exchangers, and desiccants have improved the energy efficiency of such systems."" He adds that government support, subsidies, or environmental regulations could drive further adoption of the technology. One development which has helped the adoption of such water systems is the move to digital payments. Headquartered in Italy, Veragon has water production units across the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and South America. “When we originally started with off-grid communities, it was a cash-based society which wasn’t really viable… nowadays it’s being digitalised,” says Veragon global business director Stephen White. “For example, the majority of Cambodia is covered by 4G and Covid saw an explosion of e-wallets. There’s much better private infrastructure and partnership -  the government doesn’t have to be involved, and we sell water at much lower price.” He says all units will be moved to digital in the next few months. However, the prices of the units is not cheap. Veragon says its units, which use the cooling and condensing system, cost between $60,000 and $70,000. But Mr Shrivastav points that making water in situ has a cost advantage as water is quite heavy and not easy to transport around. Looking ahead, Uravu Labs is exploring how advancements in material science can improve the efficiency of desiccants, or how utilising a different material for absorbing more moisture from the air could make the process more effective. Mr Shrivastav says these advancements will also result in reducing the heat required from 60C to 40C. They are also hoping to run pilot projects involving installing its units in data centres in India and Singapore. Data centres generate a lot of heat which is usually lost, but Uravu plans to instead to use it create fresh water. “This process will result in up to 95% reduction in fresh water consumption [by the datacentre] as Uravu's system captures most of the waste heat and gives back cold water, thus very little freshwater is needed as a top-up,” says Mr Shrivastav.

bbc,At least 16 dead as cyclone hits Bangladesh and India,27 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvv8q10vxvo,"At least 16 people have died after a cyclone crashed into coastal parts of India and southern Bangladesh. The region was hit by strong gales of 110km/h, torrential rain and tidal surges that have left low-lying areas flooded. Nearly a million people were evacuated as Cyclone Remal made landfall on Sunday evening. According to local authorities, approximately 8.4 million people lived in the cyclone's path, including 3.6 million children. The storm passed through the Bangladeshi port of Mongla and the Sagar Islands of West Bengal, India, on Sunday, weakening the following day. Bangladesh's minister for disaster Mohibbur Rahman told AFP news agency at least 10 people were killed in the cyclone. Some died from drowning and some from being crushed beneath their collapsed houses. ""A total of 3.75 million people have been affected... 35,483 homes were destroyed by the cyclone, and another 115,992 homes were damaged,"" Mr Rahman said. In neighbouring India, Sumit Gupta, a senior official in the West Bengal state government, confirmed the deaths of at least six civilians, including three who had been electrocuted. The cyclone destroyed thousands of homes, uprooted trees and damaged power lines. Strong winds blew the roofs off some tin and thatched houses, while mud huts were flattened. Ahead of Cyclone Remal, nearly three million people in Bangladesh saw their electricity shut off to avoid accidents, ministry officials said. Authorities in West Bengal quoted by Reuters news agency said at least 1,200 power poles had been uprooted. ""We have had no electricity since night, my mobile battery will run out any time,"" Rahat Raja from Bangladesh's coastal district of Satkhira told Reuters. A villager from Bagerhat in the country's south told the BBC the cyclone had created food shortages. ""There are no vehicles available on the road. There are shortages of food also. All shops are closed since yesterday,” Mohammed Ali said. Among the country's affected areas is Cox's Bazar in the southeast, where camps housing the nearly a million Rohingya refugees are at risk from landslides and flooding due to their flimsy temporary shelters. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) in the Asia Pacific region said they warned people in the camps, and had trained volunteers on standby, ready to relocate people living in ""high-risk areas"". Save the Children said it had sent four emergency response teams to the country's affected areas, including a medical team, to support recovery. The charity's country director Shumon Sengupta said the cyclone ""shows yet again how vulnerable Bangladesh is to extreme weather events"". Bangladesh is one of the world's most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change, suffering extremes from heatwaves to flooding. Cyclone Remal has been moving across the Bay of Bengal over the past few days, allowing authorities in both countries to prepare for its arrival. In Kolkata, the capital of India's West Bengal state, more than 50 flights were cancelled on Sunday. Flights have since resumed. In May 2023, the Bay of Bengal was hit by the region's most powerful cyclone in more than a decade, affecting thousands in Bangladesh and Myanmar. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,"Delhi hospital where babies died lacked licence, fire exits",27 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp33vmn3d8eo,"A hospital in Indian capital Delhi where seven babies died in a fire was operating without a valid licence, police said. The fire occurred on Saturday, leading to the arrests of the hospital owner and the doctor on duty. An investigation has found that the hospital also did not have fire extinguishers or an emergency exit. The tragedy took place hours after a fire broke out in a gaming arcade in Gujarat state's Rajkot city, killing 27 people.  Fires often break out in residential and commercial buildings in India due to a lax enforcement of safety norms. Saturday's tragedy, where a blaze engulfed the hospital in Delhi's Vivek Vihar neighbourhood, has horrified and angered people. Police commissioner Shahdara Surendra Chaudhary told ANI news agency that the hospital's NOC (No Objection Certificate) had expired on 31 March. A fire NOC - which certifies that a building meets fire safety standards - is required for hospital buildings that have a height of more than 15m (49ft). Mr. Chaudhary added that the hospital was permitted only five beds but had installed 10. At the time of the fire, 12 newborn babies were at the hospital. Five of them are now being treated at another hospital. Police have arrested Dr Naveen Kichi, director of the hospital and a doctor named Akash (the police shared only one name) in connection with the fire. They have been charged with culpable homicide. Dr Akash, who was on duty at the time of the incident, was not qualified to treat newborn babies in need of intensive care, police said. The Delhi government has ordered a magisterial inquiry. Dramatic visuals of fire engulfing the building on Saturday circulated on social media. The director of Delhi's fire department, Atul Garg, told the Press Trust of India news agency that the fire had spread due to a blast in an oxygen cylinder. Media reports say that the police is also investigating the possibility of the hospital running an illegal oxygen cylinder filling racket after locals reported suspicious activities. Officials also said rescue efforts were slowed by limited access to the building, which has a single staircase and no fire escape. Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the tragedy was ""heartbreaking"". ""The causes of the incident are being investigated and whoever is responsible for this negligence will not be spared,"" Mr Kejriwal said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi described it as ""heart-rending."" He has announced an ex gratia of 200,000 rupees ($2407; £1889) to the family members of each of the deceased and 50,000 rupees each to those injured. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,LGBTQ Indians are more accepted than ever - but politics hasn't caught up,27 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68933715,"Madhu Bai says she is like a rainbow. She rose from a storm, fleetingly spread joy and then returned to the sky. The 44-year-old made history in 2015 when she became the first trans person to be elected a mayor in India. She won in Raigarh, a small town in the central state of Chhattisgarh. But when her term ended in 2020, Madhu returned to her old life without a pension or government benefits. She dances and sings with other hijras, or trans women, at weddings and birth ceremonies - a common livelihood in India's transgender community. Madhu has no intention of re-joining politics. She says she is tired and thinks it's too polarised. ""I fought, won and worked for the people. Now I want to live for myself."" Madhu's short but successful political foray in India is a rarity in a field where the LGBTQ community is still heavily underrepresented. It's perplexing, activists say, in a democracy where acceptance of sexual and gender diversity has been on the rise and the community has seen many wins. In 2014, the Supreme Court officially recognised transgender people and their rights to welfare and other government benefits. Four years later, it scrapped a colonial-era ban on gay sex. Over half of Indian adults now believe same-sex marriage should be legal, according to a Pew survey. But LGBTQ Indians cannot only rely on the courts for change, as a ruling from the top court to not legalise same-sex unions demonstrated last year. Judges declared that changing the law was a matter for politicians, not the justice system. Campaigners say that LGBTQ politicians are the best advocates for their community. Yet in this year's general election, no major political party has fielded a single openly LGBTQ candidate. ""Queer people have been left out of conversations, told politics is not an avenue for them for so long,"" says Anish Gawande, a writer and founder of Pink List India, the country's first archive of politicians supporting LGBTQ+ rights. ""They never got the chance to build the necessary structures to advocate their demands."" No-one knows this better than Madhu. She says overcoming the ridicule and contempt of her opponents was more challenging than wooing voters, who connected with her instantly. After going door-to-door with her friends for days, asking for money to fund the campaign, she struggled to get a party ticket. Indian elections are expensive, and contesting independently without political funding is costlier. But she had no option after the two main political parties rejected her. When she won, she thought leaders would take her seriously. They didn't. At her first meeting, she says, members of several parties walked out. She alleges that a local leader threatened to slap her because he found her dance videos offensive. There were also days, in the beginning, when Madhu said she felt unsure whether she could use the women's washroom around party workers. ""People loved me and my work, but rivals hated my guts,"" she says. ""Behind the ridicule and abuse, I know they were all thinking the same thing: 'How could a hijra be the mayor?'"" The only official data on India's LGBTQ population is the government estimate: 2.5 million. But survey estimates suggest the true figure could be over 135 million. Campaigners say things have changed since Madhu won her seat. Today, more Indians know someone who is LGBTQ than they did a few years ago. Even some politicians, who were once wary of the subject, are becoming allies and promising more rights. ""Political parties in India are slowly peeping out of the closet and talking more prominently about LGBTQ rights,"" says Harish Iyer, one of India's first openly gay persons to be involved with a political party. There's also a growing momentum among the youth, who, Mr Iyer says, want to ""do away with homophobia once and for all"". This year's election campaign comes months after the Supreme Court decided to not legalise same-sex unions. Three opposition parties have promised to recognise same-sex couples legally, but the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - which polls suggest is likely to win a historic third term - has not. Despite this, Mr Gawande insists that LGBTQ rights are a current that Indian politics can no longer dismiss. The community's social and cultural capital is ""far in excess of its numerical strength"", he says. He expects the near future to bring wins on recognising relationships, affirmative action for trans people and access to healthcare. Some of these fights might not grab headlines - especially those affecting poorer people, who are at the sharp end of exclusion from jobs, education and political opportunities. ""LGBTQ struggles need to be seen through the lens of caste privilege,"" says Grace Banu, a Dalit (formerly untouchable) trans woman activist from the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Born in a poor family, she says she first faced discrimination because of her caste, and then over her gender. When she came out at the age of 14, her school barred her from taking classes and made her sit under a tree as punishment. When she resisted, her parents put her in a psychiatric hospital to ""cure her illness"". ""I would tell myself that this cannot be my destiny,"" she says. ""One day, I ran away to make my own fate."" Today, Ms Banu is a software engineer, the first trans woman with an engineering degree in her state, and considers herself a mother to 12 trans women. She lives in Chennai with a clan of three trans women, all of whom are also involved in the anti-caste and trans rights movement. Sprawled in the living room, they talk passionately about their lives, the conversations swerving across topics. One moment they are discussing their next court battle and the next minute they are wondering what to eat for lunch. ""The transgender, or the LGBTQ identity, is not a monolith,"" says Ms Banu, while her friends busy themselves in the kitchen, the clatter of plates occasionally interrupting the afternoon stillness. The 44-year-old recently petitioned an Indian court seeking ""horizontal reservations"", or separate quotas for transgender people in government jobs, within the existing quotas for historically disadvantaged communities. Ms Banu stresses that being transgender varies vastly across caste and class lines. Her fight, she says, focuses on the most marginalised. At the other end of Chennai, in an upscale apartment along the sea, lives Apsara Reddy, a trans woman and spokesperson of AIADMK, one of Tamil Nadu's main political parties. A former journalist with degrees from Australia and the UK, Ms Reddy's is a life of luxury: she drives a shiny silver Jaguar, collects art and wears the finest of silk saris. Ms Reddy acknowledges her privilege, but says: ""In politics, you need to look at the larger picture. You can't just be the voice of your own community."" Ms Reddy hasn't contested in an election but if she does, she doesn't want to be typecast ""as an LGBTQ flagbearer"" of her party. ""If you want to judge me, do it on the basis of my potential as a policy-maker, not my gender identity."" Activists say few in the LGBTQ community are able to come out like Ms Reddy, let alone conceive a life in politics. Mr Gawande suggests that for a long time, the community was never a political priority. The battle for equality taking place in the courts made it difficult for them to build relationships with other marginalised communities under a broader fight for equality, he says. Now he wants the community to focus on grassroots political activism, which he believes will raise the profile of LGBTQ issues. Mr Iyer, however, believes the ball is now in the court of the country's leaders. ""We are your friends, your family, customers, beneficiaries; we are everywhere but you haven't looked for us. If you call us, we will come to you, and that's what we expect from political parties."" Back in Raigarh, Madhu says it gets hard to get by sometimes, without a fixed pay. But given the life she's had, she's not constrained by what may lie ahead. ""Whatever it is, it's definitely not politics,"" she says, her jaunty sing-song voice soaring into a laugh. But she hopes others from the community seek political opportunities, so that queer people are no longer seen as oddities. ""Who knows, maybe then the country will see a rainbow again.""

bbc,Newborn babies die after fire at Delhi hospital,26 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c722zv2r64do,"At least six newborn babies have died following a fire at a hospital in Delhi, according to police. The blaze broke out late on Saturday evening at a hospital in the Indian capital's Vivek Vihar region. There were 12 babies in the unit, senior police officer Surendra Choudhary said. Another had died before the fire began. Authorities said legal action would be taken against the owner of the hospital, who had fled. Dramatic pictures on social media show several bursts of fire engulfing the building. Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the fire was ""heartbreaking"". ""The causes of the incident are being investigated and whoever is responsible for this negligence will not be spared,"" Mr Kejriwal said. The director of Delhi's fire department, Atul Garg, told the Press Trust of India news agency that 14 fire trucks had been sent to fight the blaze. ""The fire spread too fast due to a blast in an oxygen cylinder,"" he said. Officials said rescue efforts were slowed by limited access to the building, which has a single staircase and no fire escape. The hospital is squeezed between residential houses. It is not clear yet whether it followed all safety regulations, nor what initially caused the fire. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on X: ""The fire tragedy at a hospital in Delhi is heart-rending."" Earlier on Saturday, a ""massive fire"" broke out at a games arcade in Rajkot, in the western state of Gujarat. At least 27 people perished in that blaze, local officials said. Many of the victims are believed to be children. Families of the deceased are awaiting the results of DNA testing before the bodies can be handed over. Investigators are probing whether sparks from a welding machine ignited the blaze, according to local media. CCTV footage reportedly showed a welding machine being operated above piles of flammable material, according to The Indian Express newspaper, which cited a government official. A short circuit was previously believed to have been responsible for the blaze. Within a matter of hours following the fire breaking out, the two-storey building had been destroyed. When the BBC’s team reached the location, all that was visible was scrap metal and burnt debris. Authorities continued searching for further bodies in the rubble on Sunday. Fires are not uncommon in Indian cities as building bylaws are often flouted, residential and commercial areas not clearly segregated and enforcement of safety regulations can be lax. In 2019, a large fire swept through a bag factory in the capital, killing 43 workers. Additional reporting by Roxy Gagdekar Chhara, BBC Gujarati Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Fighting for votes in 'the world's biggest data mine',26 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggqx4lwp6o,"They are the apps every Indian has on their phone - the one where you order your taxi, your food, find your next date. Innocuous, everyday, unremarkable to billions around the world. In India, these are also potentially the apps telling politicians everything they could possibly want to know about you - whether you want them to or not. A person's religion, mother tongue, ""the way you draft a message to your friend on social media"" have all become points of data politicians are keen to get their hands on, according to political strategist Rutwik Joshi, who is working with at least a dozen unnamed lawmakers on their re-election campaigns this election. And India’s combination of high smartphone take-up and lax regulations allowing private companies to sell data mean that most political parties have gathered ""the data to do everything"" - even down to knowing “what you are eating today"", he claims. The question is, why do they care? Put simply, says Mr Joshi, this level of information can predict the vote - ""and these predictions usually never go wrong"". But perhaps the bigger question is: why should you care? Microtargeting - described by Privacy International as the use of personal data “to target you with information and adverts to an unprecedented degree of personalisation” - is not new when it comes to elections. But it was in the wake of former US President Donald Trump’s 2016 win that it really hit the headlines. Back then, political consultancy Cambridge Analytica was credited with helping him to victory using data sold by Facebook to profile people and send them pro-Trump content. The firm denied these allegations but suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix. In 2022, Meta agreed to pay $725m (£600m) to settle a class action lawsuit over a data breach linked to Cambridge Analytica. It left people questioning whether the adverts they had seen had swayed their votes. Countries around the world were concerned enough about the impact on democracy that they swung into action. In India, a Cambridge Analytica affiliate said the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the opposition Congress party were its clients - which both denied. The country's then IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also warned of action against the company and Facebook if it misused data of Indian citizens. But there has since been little to stop micro-targeting of voters, data and security researcher Srinivas Kodali says. ""Every other election commission - like in the UK and Singapore - they all tried to understand the role of data and micro targeting in elections, they created certain forms of checks and balances, which is what normally an election commission should be doing, but we are not seeing that happen in India,"" he says. In India, the problem is compounded because it's ""a data society that was planned and built by the government without any safeguards"", Mr Kodali says. Indeed, there are some 650m smartphones users in the country - all boasting apps which could potentially share their data with a third party. But you don't necessarily need a smartphone to be vulnerable: one of the biggest holders of personal data is the government itself – and even it has been selling personal information to private companies. “The government built large databases of citizens, shared it with the private sector,” Mr Kodali says. This has all left citizens vulnerable to increased surveillance with little control over what information remains private, warns Prateek Waghre, executive director at the digital rights organisation Internet Freedom Foundation. Meanwhile, a data protection law passed by the government last year is yet to be implemented, experts say. The lack of rules is an issue, says Mr Kodali. ""It's like the wild, wild west - except on the internet."" And the result of all of this available data? As Mr Joshi puts it, India entered the election year as ""the biggest possible data mine in the world right now"". The thing is, no one is doing anything illegal, says Mr Joshi. "" I am not asking [the app], 'Give me mobile numbers of how many users you have and all the contact numbers of those users as well'. But I can ask, 'Are people eating veg or non-veg in your area?'"" he explains. And the apps are able to hand over that data – because the user gave them permission. ""For example, there are 10 different Indian apps in your mobile phone - you have given access to your contacts, to your gallery, to your mic, to your speakers, to your location, including the live location,"" Mr Joshi, whose company, Neeti I, has been using data to understand voter behaviour patterns in particular constituencies, says. And it is this data – along with data collected by party workers - which is then used to help decide who the candidate should be, where the candidate's wife should go to do a puja or aarti (offer prayers), what kind of speeches they should give - even what to wear. But does this level of targeting really work to change people’s mind? That remains unclear. But campaigners say on a basic level, it is a violation of people’s privacy. Extrapolating it further, having this level of detail could be used against people in the future. ""Just the fact that it is happening is problematic."" says Pratik Waghre, executive director at the digital rights organisation Internet Freedom Foundation. ""What we've seen is that there often doesn't seem to be a clear distinction between how data is being handled when someone is beneficiary of a government scheme and how that information is then being used by that particular political party which happens to be in power in a particular state or at a national level to then use that to micro target people with campaign messages."" The law also allows the government and government bodies to exempt themselves from vast sections on its discretion. It also has the powers to process, use or share this personal data with third parties. Mr Waghre fears future administrations could take it a step further. ""It can also be: ‘Let's collectively see who's supporting us and only give them the benefits’.” The use of such data also comes against the backdrop of India's larger misinformation problem, Mr Kodali says. And when combined with the amount of data on offer, it is a real problem. ""When you talk about artificial intelligence, targeted advertisements, micro targeting of voters - a lot of this falls under the idea of computational propaganda,"" he explains. ""Questions of this were raised heavily during the 2016 Trump election, where this election is considered as something that was influenced by foreign actors."" Mr Kodali says use of data and technology in election campaigns must be regulated just like money and ad spending currently is in order to keep elections fair. “If you have one or few set of political parties or groups with access to these technologies gaming elections, they may be free but they will stop looking fair,” he warns.

bbc,An Indian tale of love and sisterhood unfolds at Cannes,25 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl55dpd4d24o,"Indian filmmaker Payal Kapadia’s new film opens with street scenes of contemporary Mumbai. But All We Imagine as Light does not show us the rich, elite Mumbai of Bollywood stars and billionaire industrialists. Instead the filmmaker overlays the street images with voices of real immigrants of Mumbai who are the city’s heartbeat. This is Kapadia’s first narrative feature and it premiered on Thursday night in the main competition section of the Cannes Film Festival. The film received an eight-minute-long standing ovation. It's a significant achievement for the filmmaker, and also for India. This is the first time in 30 years that an Indian film has played in Cannes’ main competition section. Kapadia, 38, shares the limelight and the possibility of winning one of the festival’s prestigious awards with the likes of Francis Ford Coppola, Yorgos Lanthimos, Ali Abbasi, Jacques Audiard, and Jia Zhangke. Over the last four decades, Indian films have done fairly well on the world festival circuit. Mira Nair’s Salaam Bombay won the Camera d’Or at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival. A few days before the September 11 terrorist attacks, Nair’s 2001 classic Monsoon Wedding won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Director Ritesh Batra’s 2013 celebrated film The Lunchbox won the Grand Golden Rail Award at Cannes. And earlier this year director Shuchi Talati’s Girls Will Be Girls was awarded the Grand Jury and Audience prizes at the Sundance Film Festival. But the possibility of Palm d’Or or one of the other key Cannes awards has so far eluded India – the biggest film producing country in the world. This year, thanks to Kapadia’s beautifully realised and moving film, India stands a good chance of winning. Already the reviews have been full of high praise. The Guardian in its five-star review describes it as ""glorious… an absorbing story full of humanity"". The critic puts the film on a par with Satyajit Ray’s Mahanagar (The Big City) and Aranyer Din Ratri (Days and Nights in the Forest). And IndieWire in its A-grade review says Kapadia’s drama gives Mumbai a romantic gaze, as reflected in the way ""people occupy their space… whether alone or sharing"". Daughter of a well-known Indian artist Nalini Malani, Kapadia is very familiar with Mumbai, a multicultural and diverse city. ""It’s also a place where it’s a little bit easier for women to work as compared to many other places in the country,"" Kapadia says. ""I wanted to make a film about women who leave their homes to go to work somewhere else."" In All We Know as Light, Kapadia tracks the lives and struggles of two Indian nurses from the southern state of Kerala working in a hospital and living together in a small, congested apartment in Mumbai. One nurse – Prabha (Kani Kusruti, who played a supporting role in Girls Will Be Girls) - is married. Her husband now works in Germany and barely ever communicates with her. But then she suddenly receives a surprise gift from her husband – a rice cooker. She hugs the machine, as if it is the last sign of love in her marriage. The second nurse, Anu (Divya Prabha), is more adventurous and is carrying a secret romance with a young Muslim man Shiaz (a charming young actor, Hridhu Haroon) who is also from Kerala. Anu is Hindu and her family would not approve of her relationship with Shiaz. Mumbai’s congested environment with 22 million people clamouring for space and its harsh monsoon season does not allow Anu and Shiaz any privacy. But then suddenly a third nurse from their hospital – Parvaty (Chhaya Kadam, appearing in two films at Cannes this year) - decides to leave the city, forced out by the redevelopment of a slum for the city's rich. Could this be the chance to change the course of these characters' lives? The politics of negotiating space is no different than the struggles of students Kapadia captured in her last film – a documentary titled A Night of Knowing Nothing. The film premiered in the Directors’ Fortnight sidebar section of the Cannes festival in 2022. It won the L'Œil d'or ""Golden Eye"", the festival’s top documentary award. A Night of Knowing Nothing followed the 2015 students’ strike at the country’s prestigious government-run Film and Television Institute of India. Kapadia was part of the strike, and finally graduated from the institute with a degree in direction in 2018. In an interview in 2022 she described the documentary as a ""love letter to public universities and what they stand for – a place where ideally people of all strata of society can be together and enjoy freedom, both intellectual and physical"".

bbc,In pictures: North India boils as temperatures near 50C,24 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyjj7y7zy74o,"Parts of northern India continue to reel under a prolonged heatwave that has thrown normal life out of gear. On Thursday, temperatures soared beyond 45C in many states and touched 48.8C in Rajasthan state's Barmer city. India's weather department has said that the heatwave is likely to continue till Wednesday. Several regions are facing water and electricity shortages due to spikes in power consumption. On Wednesday, Delhi's peak power demand reached 8,000MW, the highest in the history of the Indian capital. Delhi is experiencing a brutal heat spell, with temperatures hovering around 45-46C through this week. Weather experts say that the heat index - or the apparent or experienced temperature - has crossed 50C because of the high levels of humidity. Hospitals in the city have set up special facilities to treat patients experiencing heat-related illnesses, which are also on the rise. Rohit Nair, 34, who works in advertising in Delhi, says that the heat is unbearable. ""I just feel exhausted the entire day. Delhi is boiling this year,"" he says. Mr Nair says he avoids stepping out during the afternoons, but it's uncomfortable even indoors. ""It's impossible to sit without the air conditioner on,"" he says. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Google to make Pixel phones and drones in India,24 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq55z7ynjyro,"Tech giant Google will soon begin making its Pixel smartphones in India, sources aware of the development have told the BBC. Google is set to manufacture the phones at an existing Foxconn facility in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The firm is also set to independently manufacture drones in the state. India has emerged as a key destination for global firms looking to diversify supply lines outside China in the midst of geopolitical tensions with the West. Last year, Google had announced plans to make Pixel smartphones in India, beginning with the Pixel 8. ""India is a priority market for Pixel smartphones, and we’re committed to bringing the best of our hardware and underlying built-in software capabilities to people across the country,"" it said in a blog post. On Friday, sources told the BBC that Alphabet's Google would make advanced versions of Pixel smartphones at the Tamil Nadu facility and that manufacturing would begin within this calendar year. Google and Foxconn have signed a contract to this end, the source said. Foxconn currently has two facilities in Tamil Nadu. At one of its facilities near Chennai city, it assembles Apple's iPhones. Google's decision to make Pixel phones in Tamil Nadu came after state officials met company executives recently. According to a statement from the Tamil Nadu government, officials from Google are also set to meet state Chief Minister MK Stalin in Chennai soon. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Czech court okays extradition of US murder plot accused,23 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c06682y50veo,"The Czech Constitutional Court has rejected an Indian man's petition against his extradition to the US over an alleged plot to assassinate an American citizen in New York. Nikhil Gupta has been charged by the US government with trying to hire a hitman to assassinate US-based Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. Mr Gupta is in jail in Prague. A final decision on his extradition will be taken by the country's justice minister. The charges against Mr Gupta carry up to 20 years in prison. In November 2023, US prosecutors charged Mr Gupta with a plot to kill at least four Sikh separatists in North America, including Mr Pannun. They said that Mr Gupta had paid $100,000 (£79,000) in cash to a hitman to assassinate Mr Pannun, a dual US-Canadian citizen, in New York. But the hitman was actually an undercover federal agent, prosecutors said. Mr Gupta was allegedly directed by an Indian government official who was not named or charged in the indictment. India has designated Mr Pannun a terrorist, an allegation he denies, claiming to be an activist who believes in the movement for Khalistan, or a separate Sikh homeland. The White House said it raised the alleged assassination plot with India at the most senior level. India officials distanced themselves from the plot, saying such actions were against government policy. It also said it had formed a committee to investigate the allegations against Mr Gupta. In January, India's Supreme Court rejected a plea from Mr Gupta which asked it to aid his release and help him get a fair trial. The petition in India had claimed that Mr Gupta was arrested by ""self-claimed"" US federal agents and has not yet been given a fair trial. India's top court said it would not intervene in the case, adding that it was up to the government to take action. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,These elephants are dying on rail tracks - can AI save them?,21 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68988189,"The southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu is using an AI-based surveillance system to prevent elephant deaths on its railway tracks. Elephant deaths on and near the state's railway tracks are rising, with 36 fatalities recorded from train collisions in the past decade, according to official data. Eleven of these fatalities occurred on two railway tracks near Madukkarai, where the forest borders the state of Kerala. These tracks intersect with the elephants' migratory route to neighbouring forests. In 2021, the state's high court ordered the forest department and railways to prevent elephant deaths on these tracks. The forest department has now installed 12 towers along two of Madukkarai's rail tracks, each equipped with an AI camera capable of thermal and visible light imaging, along with live viewing. Project manager Ashish Rajput said that the AI system's cameras, comparable to those used by the Indian Army along the nation's borders, are programmed to even detect humans near railway lines. When elephants are detected within 100ft of the railway track, alerts are sent to forest and railway officials, who coordinate to slow down trains and guide the elephants away to prevent collisions. Four personnel continuously monitor the system in the control room near the railway track. The project, launched in February, has been executed at a cost of 72.4m rupees ($867,758; £683,976), says Supriya Sahu, secretary of the Tamil Nadu Forest Department. Previously, forest personnel conducted regular patrols along railway tracks to monitor elephant activity. Ms Sahu said this method had limitations, and ensuring complete elephant safety from accidents posed ""significant challenges"". Within months of its implementation, the AI system has detected nearly 400 instances of elephants approaching railway tracks and promptly reported to railway authorities, thus preventing potential accidents, she said. ""Alerts are sent if any animal, not just elephants, is found nearing the track,"" say Mr Manikandan, who works at the control room. This is not the first time AI is being used to protect wildlife in India. In December, India's federal railway ministry said it was implementing an AI-based surveillance system - called Gajraj - in elephant corridors across several states in the country. Under this project, officials are installing sensors using AI tech near railway tracks which send notifications to alert the railway administration and the forest department about the movement of the elephants, other animals, and humans to prevent accidents. In African countries like Gabon, Kenya and Botswana, AI camera systems are being used for elephant conservation efforts. Tamil Nadu has announced plans for its expansion of the new system to five other vulnerable areas in the state, including Coimbatore, Dharmapuri, Hosur, and Gudalur. ""Technological interventions significantly reduce train-related accidents involving wildlife,"" Ms Sahu said. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Delhi sizzles as temperatures cross 45C,20 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c888e0730zpo,"Northern India, including capital Delhi, is reeling under a fierce heatwave with temperatures soaring above 45C over the weekend. On Sunday, Najafgarh district in Delhi recorded a temperature of 47.8C, the highest in the country this season. The weather department has said the heat spell is likely to continue this week. The searing heat comes as India is holding its general election, the results of which will be declared on 4 June. Indian summers, which extend from March to September, are usually hot and humid. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has said the country is likely to experience longer and more intense heatwaves this year. On Saturday, temperatures crossed 45C in 10 locations in the National Capital Region (NCR), which encompasses Delhi and some districts from the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan. The IMD has predicted that maximum temperatures in Delhi and other northern cities are likely to hover around 45-46C over Monday and Tuesday. It has also predicted a fresh heat spell over parts of western and central India over the next few days. Many Indian states, reeling under the heatwave, are also going to the polls this week. On Monday, millions of voters will cast their votes in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar while Delhi will vote on 25 May. The elections are being held in seven phases from 19 April to 1 June. Many voters have expressed discomfort stepping out in the extreme heat. They say it's difficult standing in queues, especially for senior citizens. India's election authorities have extended voting timings and have asked people to protect themselves against the heat while going to vote. Summers have always been gruelling in many parts of India - especially in the northern and central regions.  While some people use air-conditioners and water coolers to keep themselves cool, others, especially in the more distant towns, have devised their own ways of coping with the heat - from keeping water cool in earthen jugs to taking drinks made with raw mango pulp to ward off heat strokes.

bbc,India's Priyanka Gandhi to finally make electoral debut,13 hrs ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjmmg4pm0m4o,"Priyanka Gandhi, sister of India's main opposition Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, is set to contest her first election, ending decades of anticipation by her supporters. Ms Gandhi is a descendant of the Nehru-Gandhi family, India's most famous political dynasty, and her electoral debut will be closely watched. The 52-year-old will contest the Wayanad seat in the southern Indian state of Kerala after her brother relinquishes it. A win for Ms Gandhi would mean the presence of all three Gandhi family members in the Indian parliament. Her mother Sonia Gandhi, former president of the Congress party, is an MP in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the parliament. Her brother Mr Gandhi won the recent parliamentary elections from both Wayanad and Uttar Pradesh's Rae Bareli seats. Mr Gandhi, who has represented Wayanad as an MP since 2019, is giving it up as he can only retain one parliamentary seat under Indian law. On Monday, he thanked the people of Wayanad for their ""love, affection and support"". A date for the by-election is yet to be announced but Ms Gandhi says she is ""not nervous at all"". ""I am very happy to be able to represent Wayanad and I will not let them feel his [Rahul Gandhi's] absence,"" she said on Monday. ""I will work hard and I will try my best to make everyone happy and be a good representative."" The by-election will mark the end of a decades-long wait by Congress supporters for Ms Gandhi's involvement in electoral politics. Journalist Javed Ansari, who has reported on the Congress party for decades, told BBC Hindi that he was not surprised by the announcement. ""I think it was a question of when [she would contest] and not if,"" he said. For years, Ms Gandhi was considered the more popular of the Gandhi siblings with many blaming the ""lacklustre leadership"" of her brother for a string of Congress defeats between 2014 and 2019. From an early age, people have pointed to Ms Gandhi’s resemblance to her grandmother and former prime minister Indira Gandhi. Ms Gandhi was actively involved in the election campaigns of her mother from the late 1990s. She also campaigned for her brother when he actively joined politics in 2004. Senior leaders have praised her political acumen and her flair for engaging with people. Ms Gandhi's official entry into politics came when she was put in charge of the Congress campaign in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh state, ahead of the 2019 general election. The Congress went on to perform poorly in that election and the state assembly polls in 2022, but Ms Gandhi was not blamed. Senior party leaders said the performance was not a reflection of her work and in line with their expectations. Appointed Congress' general secretary in 2019, Ms Gandhi has since overseen the party's campaigns in several state elections. Party leaders say she’s been crucial in stabilising the Congress government in Himachal Pradesh state this year amid rebellion by some of its own lawmakers. She was also at the forefront of the Congress's campaign in Uttar Pradesh state - where opposition parties performed surprisingly well - and especially in the Gandhi family bastions of Amethi and Rae Bareli. ""She held the fort for Rahul and that is how he could campaign across the country,"" Mr Ansari said. Political commentator Neerja Chowdhury said it would be interesting to see the siblings in parliament together if Ms Gandhi wins. “Personally, I think Priyanka is savvier of the two. She thinks on her feet and her language is clearer than his,"" she said, adding that she will be ""watched very closely"". Congress leaders and workers in Kerala have expressed happiness at the possibility of having Ms Gandhi as an MP from Wayanad. ND Ayyappan, president of the party committee in the district, said: ""It indicates that the family will continue its ties with the people of Wayanad."" The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has criticised dynastic politics in response to news of Ms Gandhi's electoral debut. ""Congress is not a party but a family business,"" BJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla said. But the announcement of her candidacy received praise from Annie Raja, a member of the Communist Party of India (CPI) who had contested against Mr Gandhi in Wayanad in the recent election. Ms Raja, who lost the election by a margin of over 360,000 votes, did not confirm whether she would run against Ms Gandhi in the by-election. But she said, ""We need more and more women in parliament."" Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Will India's Booker Prize-winning author face jail for 14-year-old remark?,21 hrs ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggyz13m2po,"Will one of India's most celebrated writers really face prosecution for things she said more than a decade ago? Last week, 14 years after the original complaint, Delhi's most senior official granted permission for the Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy to be prosecuted under India’s stringent anti-terror laws. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) is notorious for making it exceptionally challenging to get bail, often resulting in years of detention until the completion of trial. The Modi government has been accused of using the law to silence critics, including activists, journalists and civil society members. Ms Roy, 62, an outspoken writer and activist, is in the dock for comments on Kashmir, a perennial lightning rod in India. “Kashmir has never been an integral part of India. It is a historical fact. Even the Indian government has accepted this,” she said at a stormy, day-long conference in Delhi, organised by the Committee for the Release of Political Prisoners, in October 2010. At the time, Indian-administered Kashmir was in turmoil, with locals describing it as a fierce uprising against India. Ms Roy's remarks had followed the deaths of dozens of protesters since fresh pro-freedom demonstrations broke out earlier that year. India and neighbouring Pakistan, nuclear armed-rivals, claim the disputed region in full and have fought two wars over it. Ms Roy’s remarks predictably set off a firestorm of protest, with many critics questioning her loyalty to India, and the federal government, then led by the Congress party, threatening to arrest her on charges of sedition. A senior minister  said while India enjoyed freedom of speech, ""it can't violate the patriotic sentiments of the people"". There were protests outside Ms Roy's home in an upscale Delhi neighbourhood. A criminal complaint was lodged against her and another defendant Sheikh Showkat Hussain, a law teacher from Kashmir, accusing them and two others of sedition. Ms Roy defended her right to free speech soon after the controversy. ""In the papers some have accused me of giving 'hate-speeches', of wanting India to break up. On the contrary, what I say comes from love and pride,"" she wrote in a response. ""It comes from not wanting people to be killed, raped, imprisoned or have their finger-nails pulled out in order to force them to say they are Indians... Pity the nation that has to silence its writers for speaking their minds."" Lawyers are puzzled by the decision to prosecute Ms Roy more than a decade after her speech. She was originally accused of sedition, but the Supreme Court suspended the colonial-era sedition law in May 2022; invoking UAPA charges allows the state to bypass the statute of limitations and proceed with the case. Ms Roy has been a trenchant critic of Mr Modi's government, which rights groups accuse of targeting activists and muzzling free speech. The permission for her prosecution comes just after Mr Modi's re-election for a third term. Many view this as a political signal that the BJP will continue its strong-arm tactics, even in coalition government. Sushil Pandit, the main complainant from 2010, refused to speculate on the delay. ""Those who sat on these files and decided to act now should explain. There must be an inquiry into why this was delayed, and accountability should follow,"" he told Times Now television. Others view this as another attempt to silence Mr Modi's critics. Writer Amitav Ghosh wrote on X: ""The hounding of Arundhati Roy is absolutely unconscionable. She is a great writer and has the right to her opinion. There should be an international outcry against prosecuting her for something she said a decade ago."" When Delhi authorities approved the case to proceed in court in October, Canadian writer and activist Naomi Klein warned Mr Modi on X: ""You have no idea what you will unleash by pursuing this political prosecution to silence your most eloquent critic."" What exactly transpired on the day when Ms Roy made the comments? In the minutes of the conference, Shivam Vij described it as ""historic in every aspect given the topicality of the issue"". Speakers included a well-known poet, several activists and journalists. Ms Roy anticipated a heated debate. ""She began her speech by asking those who wanted to throw shoes to her to do so now,"" Mr Vij wrote. Shuddhabrata Sengupta, an artist, writer and curator who spoke at the event, wrote  that the only ""provocative actions"" - interruptions, heckling, attempts to throw objects at stage - came from ""self-declared Indian patriots"". They were allowed to speak but were asked not to disrupt the proceedings, he noted. However, Mr Pandit, the Kashmiri activist present at the meeting, had a different view. ""Openly, in the heart of the capital, Delhi, a call for the destruction of the Indian Union as a colonial, occupying state, a state that has subjugated people... had no business to survive. Such statements were made. A call to arms rang out from the podium repeatedly... by Arundhati Roy [among others].""  Over the past two decades, Ms Roy has written several non-fiction books and numerous essays on topics like nuclear weapons, Kashmir, big dams, globalisation, Dalit icon BR Ambedkar, meetings with Maoist rebels, and conversations with Edward Snowden and John Cusack. The God of Small Things, a riveting family saga inspired by her family childhood, picked up the 1997 Man Booker Prize - a ""Tiger Woodesian debut"" gushed John Updike - and made Roy a celebrity writer at 35. The 62-year-old author is also a polarising figure in India. Admirers see her as a leading voice for liberal values and a champion of the marginalised. Critics, however, have burned her effigies, disrupted her events, and she has faced charges of sedition and contempt, even spending a day in jail for protesting against big dams. They find a lot of her non-fiction writings shrill, naïve, adolescent, self-indulgent and simplistic, peddling ""picturesque poverty"". One critic wrote that so often in her essays Ms Roy ""never really gets to grips with the evidence"". Since Ms Roy's 2010 remarks, significant changes have occurred. In 2019, Mr Modi's government revoked Kashmir's semi-autonomous status, dividing the region and reducing its political autonomy under direct federal control. Many believe freedom of expression has also declined: since 2014, India has fallen from 150th to 161st in media freedom rankings by Reporters Without Borders, out of 180 countries. Ms Roy has declined to comment on the latest development. It is unclear if the police have investigated the allegations or have evidence against her and the other accused. Two individuals named in the original complaint have passed away. But one thing is certain. If one of India's most feted writers faces imprisonment under a draconian anti-terror law, it will ignite global condemnation and outrage.  Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Indian accused of plotting US Sikh murder pleads not guilty,1 day ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggy5ypj68o,"An Indian man accused of plotting to kill a Sikh separatist in New York City has pleaded not guilty in federal court. Nikhil Gupta appeared for the first time in court on Monday afternoon after being extradited from the Czech Republic and landing in the US on Friday. He is charged by US authorities with trying to hire a hitman to assassinate Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a dual US-Canadian citizen. US prosecutors allege Mr Gupta was directed by an unnamed Indian government official. India denies having anything to do with the alleged plot. Mr Gupta, 52, walked into the Manhattan federal courtroom shortly after 12:30 EDT (17:30 BST) on Monday wearing a blue sweater and black Nike sweatpants, holding his hands behind his back. After waiving the reading of his indictment, Mr Gupta was asked by Judge James Cott to enter his plea. “Not guilty,” his lawyer, Jeff Chabrowe, said on his behalf. Prosecutors asked that Mr Gupta be held in a detention centre until his trial. Mr Gupta’s lawyer said they would file a bail application at a later date, meaning Mr Gupta will be detained for now. His lawyer also complained to the judge during the 20-minute arraignment about the conditions of Mr Gupta's detention. He had not been provided a vegetarian meal since he arrived at a Brooklyn detention facility on Friday, the lawyer said. “Essentially, my client has not been able to eat,” he said. He would also need to be allowed to pray, Mr Chabrowe said. Judge Cott said Mr Chabrowe should speak to him again on Tuesday if those issues had not been resolved. Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Mr Chabrowe called the case “a complex matter for both India and the US”. He said people should refrain from “jumping to conclusions” about the allegations against Mr Gupta. “We will pursue his defence rigorously,” he said. Mr Gupta’s hearing was also attended by several Khalistan activists, including one who held the movement’s flag outside the courthouse. Mr Gupta is scheduled to appear in court again on 28 June. In November, US prosecutors charged Mr Gupta with a plot to kill at least four Sikh separatists in North America, including Mr Pannun. The charges against him carry up to 20 years in prison. Mr Gupta paid $100,000 (£79,000) in cash to a hitman to assassinate Mr Pannun, prosecutors said. The hitman, they added, was an undercover federal agent. Mr Pannun is a dual US-Canadian citizen living in New York. He is the general counsel for Sikhs for Justice, an organisation based in the US that supports the broader Khalistan movement, which calls for an independent homeland for Sikhs, who make up about 2% of India's population. Mr Pannun was designated a terrorist by the Indian government in 2020, an allegation he denies. He was also an associate of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist leader who was shot dead in Canada in his car last year. The murder led to a deterioration in India-Canada ties after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged there were ""credible allegations"" that Delhi had been involved. India denied the accusations. In November, the White House said it had raised the alleged assassination plot against Mr Pannun with India at the most senior level. Indian officials distanced themselves from the alleged plot, saying such actions were against government policy. Delhi said it had formed a committee to investigate the allegations against Mr Gupta. A group of US lawmakers urged Secretary of State Antony Blinken to lead a “strong diplomatic response” that would ensure  all parties involved “are held accountable”, according to a 17 June letter that was obtained by the BBC. The US and India ""have a crucial relationship across multiple domains"", and their ties must ""be grounded in shared commitment to democratic principles and the rule of law"", the letter adds. In January, India's Supreme Court rejected a plea from Mr Gupta which asked it to aid his release and help him get a fair trial. The petition in India claimed Mr Gupta was arrested by ""self-claimed"" US federal agents and had not yet been given a fair trial. India's top court said it would not intervene in the case, adding that it was up to the government to take action. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Nine killed in India train crash,1 day ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kkyvq081wo,"Nine people have died and around 41 have been injured in a train crash in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal. The accident occurred when a goods train hit a stationary passenger train, the Kanchenjungha Express, in the New Jalpaiguri area on Monday morning. Dramatic visuals from the accident site showed one wagon of the express train suspended in the air. Authorities say ""human error"" may have led to the crash and a detailed investigation will be held. India has one of the largest train networks in the world with millions of passengers using it daily, but a lot of the railway infrastructure needs to be improved or upgraded. Officials said ambulances and disaster teams were sent to the accident site for rescue efforts soon after the accident. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressed shock and said action was being taken on a ""war footing"". The dead include the driver and the assistant driver of the goods train and the guard of Kanchenjungha Express. ""Rescue operations have been completed,"" Jaya Varma Sinha, CEO of the Railway Board, told a press conference. The injured, she said, were being treated at a medical college in Siliguri city. ""Our first priority is for them to get the best medical aid possible."" The official said that human error seemed to be the likely cause of the accident. ""As per initial investigation, it seems that the driver of the goods train disregarded the signal."" She added that Kavach, an automatic train protection system developed by the Indian Railways, needed to be planned and expanded for West Bengal state. A police official told reporters that the engine of the goods train was damaged while three coaches of the express train were derailed. A rescue official told the Times of India they avoided using gas cutters during the relief efforts because it could endanger the lives of those trapped in the train. He said relief efforts were also slowed by heavy rain in the area. Federal Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said relief teams had worked in close coordination with railway officials to carry out rescue operations. The minister visited the site later in the day. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the incident ""saddening"" and said he had spoken to officials about the rescue efforts. ""Condolences to those who lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured recover at the earliest,"" he wrote on X. He announced a compensation of 200,000 rupees ($2,394, £1,890) for the families of the dead and 50,000 rupees for each of the injured passengers. Mr Vaishnaw later announced an enhanced compensation of 1m rupees for the dead, 250,000 rupees for those with grievous injuries and 50,000 rupees for those with minor injuries. The railways have set up a control desk with a helpline number at Rangapani station, near which the collision took place. Last year, a devastating crash involving three trains in the eastern state of Odisha had killed around 290 people and left more than 1,000 injured. After Monday's crash, India's opposition leaders criticised the government for its ""utter mismanagement"" of the railways. Congress party chief Mallikarjun Kharge alleged Mr Modi's government had turned the railways into a platform for ""self-promotion"". Kunal Ghosh, a member of West Bengal's governing Trinamool Congress (TMC) Party, also blamed Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). ""There is no safety of passengers, no improvement in technology and a lack of maintenance of the service,"" he said. The government and the railway ministry have not responded to these accusations yet. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Susannah's grandad ran Bengal when famine killed millions,3 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1vv9r4012xo,"""I feel enormous shame about what happened,"" Susannah Herbert tells me. Her grandfather was the governor of Bengal, in British India, during the run-up and height of the 1943 famine which killed at least three million people. She is only just learning about his significant role in the catastrophe, and confronting a complex family legacy. When I first meet her, she is clutching a photograph from 1940. It's Christmas Day at the governor's residence in Bengal. It's formal, with people sitting in rows, in their finery, staring straight into camera. In the front are the dignitaries - Viceroy Linlithgow, one of the most important colonial figures in India, and her grandfather Sir John Herbert, Bengal's governor. At their feet is a little boy, in a white shirt and shorts, knee-high socks and shiny shoes. It's Susannah's father. He had told her some stories of growing up in India, like the day Father Christmas came in on an elephant, but not much more. But little was spoken of her grandfather, who died in late 1943. The causes of the famine are many and complex. While John Herbert was the most important colonial figure in Bengal, he was part of a wider colonial structure. He reported to his bosses in Delhi, who reported to theirs in London. Dr Janam Mukherjee, historian and the author of Hungry Bengal, tells me Herbert ""was the colonial official most directly linked to the famine because he was the chief executive of the province of Bengal at that time"". One of the policies he executed during World War Two was known as ""denial"", where boats and rice – the staple food – were confiscated or destroyed in thousands of villages. It was done because of the fear of a Japanese invasion and the aim was to deny the enemy local resources to fuel their advance into India. However, the colonial policy was catastrophic for the already fragile local economy. Fishermen couldn't go to sea, farmers weren't able to go upstream to their plots, and artisans were unable to get their goods to market. Critically, rice could not be moved around. Inflation was already high, as the colonial government in Delhi was printing money to pay for the vast war effort on the Asian front. The hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers in Kolkata - then Calcutta - were straining food resources. Rice imports to Bengal from Burma had halted after it fell to the Japanese. Rice was hoarded, often for profit. And a deadly cyclone hit, wiping out much of Bengal's rice crop. Repeated demands - in the middle of the war - to the war cabinet and Prime Minister Winston Churchill for food imports were denied or partially heeded at the time. The numbers who died are overwhelming. I wondered why Susannah, the granddaughter of Bengal’s governor, felt shame so many decades later. She tries to explain. ""When I was young there was something almost glamorous about having a connection with the British Empire."" She says she used to borrow a lot of her grandfather's old clothes. ""There were silk scarves, with a nametape saying 'Made in British India'. ""And now when I see them at the back of a cupboard, I kind of shudder and say, why would I even want to wear these things? Because the words 'British India' on the label seem inappropriate to wear now."" Susannah is determined to know more about her grandfather's life in British India, and to make sense of things. She is reading everything she can on the Bengal famine, going through stacks of her grandparents' papers at the Herbert archive in the family home in Wales. They're kept in a climate-controlled room, and an archivist visits once a month. She starts to realise more about her grandfather. ""There's absolutely no doubt that the policies he implemented and initiated contributed enormously to the scale and impact of the famine. ""He had skills, he had honour. And he should not have been appointed to the post of running the lives of 60 million people in a faraway corner of the British Empire. He just should not have been appointed."" In the family archive she found a letter from Lady Mary, her grandmother, written to her husband in 1939, on hearing he had been offered the job of governor. It's a letter of pros and cons. She clearly had no desire for them to go, though she writes she would accept whatever decision he took. ""You read them [the letters] with hindsight, you read them knowing what the writer and reader did not know. If you could reach out to the past, you'd say: don't do it. Don't go, don't go to India. You will not do a good job."" Over the months I have been following Susannah Herbert’s journey into the past, she has had many detailed questions about her grandfather. She has been keen to meet Janam Mukherjee, the historian, to ask him directly. They meet in June. Janam admits he never imagined he would ever be sitting opposite the granddaughter of John Herbert. Susannah wants to know why her grandfather, a provincial MP and government whip, was appointed in the first place, when he had virtually no experience of Indian politics, beyond a brief spell in Delhi as a young officer. ""It's part and parcel of colonialism and stems from an idea of supremacy,"" Janam explains. ""Some MP who has no colonial experience, who has no linguistic capacities, who has not worked in a political system outside of Britain, can simply go and inhabit the governor's house in Kolkata, and make decisions about an entire population of people that he knows nothing about."" While Herbert was not popular among elected Indian politicians in Bengal, even his seniors in Delhi seem to have doubted his competence, including Viceroy Linlithgow. ""Linlithgow called him the weakest of the governors in India. They, in fact, were interested in removing him, but they were worried about how that might be received,"" says Janam. ""That is hard listening,"" Susannah replies. I am struck that for both there is a personal connection. Janam and Susannah had fathers in Kolkata who were little boys at the same time but were living completely different lives. They've both died now. Susannah at least has photographs. For Janam, there were no pictures of his father as a child. ""So what I knew was from his nightmares and from the few stories he told me of his experience in childhood, in a colonized war zone. ""I come from a sense of trying to think about my father's very damaged life and understand how that impacts me as his descendant."" And then he says something I wasn't expecting. ""My grandfather also worked for the colonial police force. So my grandfather himself was complicit with the colonial system in many ways. So there are these interesting similarities in our motivations of understanding."" At least three million people died in the Bengal famine and there is no memorial - or even a plaque - to them anywhere in the world. Susannah can at least point to a memorial to her grandfather. ""The church where we worship has a plaque honouring him."" She explains it's in the absence of a grave. She's not sure where his remains are, perhaps in Kolkata. Honour is a word that Susannah used to describe her grandfather, even though she acknowledges his failures. ""While I find it relatively easy to accept that history is much more complicated than what we were originally told, I still find it hard to envisage John Herbert […] acting in any way, dishonourably."" Janam takes a different view. ""These questions of intention have never interested me in many ways. I'm much more interested in the historical course of events because I think intentions can always mask what happens."" Eighty years on this is still complicated, and raw. I wonder if months into her research, Susannah still feels ""shame"" is the right emotion to describe how she feels? She tells me she has changed her view. ""I think the word shame centres it too much on my feelings. It's not just about me and what I think. ""It's part of a greater project, I suppose, of understanding and transmitting understanding of how we got to where we are. We? I mean Britain, I mean, this country."" Janam agrees that ""as a descendant of a colonial official, I don't think there is any particular shame that accrues intergenerationally. I think it's Britain's shame. ""I mean people died of starvation in Bengal. So I think there's cause for historical reflection on the individual level as well as the collective level."" Susannah is reflecting on her legacy. She wants to share her findings with her wider family, and she's not sure how they'll receive it. She is hoping her children might help her work her way through the mountains of papers in the family archive in Wales. They too are contending with a complex personal legacy, as Britain tries to figure out what to do with this difficult part of its war story and colonial past. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,India brings back bodies of 45 workers from Kuwait,4 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg330n9x614o,"An Indian Air Force flight has brought back the bodies of 45 workers who were killed in a fire in Kuwait. The fire broke out on Wednesday at a residential building in Mangaf city where 176 Indian workers lived. Kuwaiti authorities said 50 people were killed in the fire, including 45 from India and three from the Philippines. Two bodies are yet to be identified. Dozens of workers, most of them Indian, have also been injured in the fire. Two-thirds of the Kuwaiti population is made up of foreign workers and the country is highly dependent on migrant labour, especially in the construction and domestic sectors. Human rights groups have regularly raised concerns over their living conditions. Indian minister Kirti Vardhan Singh, who had gone to Kuwait after the incident, said DNA tests had been carried out to identify the victims. Among the workers confirmed dead, 23 are from Kerala state, seven from Tamil Nadu, three each from Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, two from Odisha and one each from Bihar, Punjab, Karnataka, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Haryana. Mr Singh said the Indian government had arranged a special Air Force flight to bring back the bodies. The flight landed in Kerala's Kochi city on Friday morning where the bodies of workers from southern Indian states were given to authorities, and then continued to Delhi. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and other state lawmakers were at the airport to receive the bodies and pay homage to them. ""This is a huge tragedy for our country. Kerala's migrant workers are the lifeblood of our state. The fire in Kuwait is one of the biggest tragedies to affect our community,"" Mr Vijayan said. The state and federal governments have announced compensation for the families of those who died in the fire. In Kuwait, authorities say they are carrying out an inspection of health and safety conditions in several buildings that house foreign workers in the country. According to the Arab Times, an investigation by authorities found that the fire started because of an electrical short circuit in the security guard’s room on the ground floor of the six-story building. A senior Kuwait fire department official had on Wednesday said that inflammable material had been used as partitions between rooms and apartments in the building. Kuwait's Public Prosecution department has detained a citizen and some expatriates on charges of manslaughter and negligence for not implementing fire safety measures, the Times reported. After the fire, Sheikh Fahad Yusuf al-Sabah, the country's deputy prime minister, had accused property owners of greed and said violations of building standards had led to the tragedy.

bbc,Can indie games inspire a creative boom from Indian developers?,5 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8vv58ry8q2o,"India might not be the first country that springs to mind when someone mentions video games, but it's one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. Analysts believe there could be more than half a billion players there by the end of this year. Most of them are playing on mobile phones and tablets, and fans will tell you the industry is mostly known for fantasy sports games that let you assemble imaginary teams based on real players. Despite concerns over gambling and possible addiction, they're big business. The country's three largest video game startups - Game 24X7, Dream11 and Mobile Premier League – all provide some kind of fantasy sport experience and are valued at over $1bn. But there's hope that a crop of story-driven games making a splash worldwide could inspire a new wave of creativity and investment. During the recent Summer Game Fest (SGF) - an annual showcase of new and upcoming titles held in Los Angeles and watched by millions - audiences saw previews of a number of story-rich titles from South Asian teams. One of those was Detective Dotson by Masala Games, based in Gujarat, about a failed Bollywood actor turned detective. Industry veteran Shalin Shodhan is behind the game and tells BBC Asian Network this focus on unique stories is “bucking the trend” in India's games industry. He wants video games to become an “interactive cultural export” but says he's found creating new intellectual property difficult. “There really isn’t anything in the marketplace to make stories about India,"" he says, despite the strength of some of the country's other cultural industries. “If you think about how much intellectual property there is in film in India, it is really surprising to think nothing indigenous exists as an original entertainment property in games,"" he says. ""It’s almost like the Indian audience accepted that we’re just going to play games from outside.” Another game shown during SGF was The Palace on the Hill – a ""slice-of-life"" farming sim set in rural India. Mala Sen, from developer Niku Games, says games like this and Detective Dotson are what “India needed”. “We know that there are a lot of people in India who want games where characters and setting are relatable to them,"" she says. Games developed by South Asian teams based in western countries have been finding critical praise and commercial success in recent years. Venba, a cooking sim that told the story of a migrant family reconnecting with their heritage through food, became the first game of its kind to take home a Bafta Game Award this year. Canada-based Visai Games, which developed the title, was revealed during SGF as one of the first beneficiaries of a new fund set up by Among Us developer Innersloth to boost fellow indie developers. That will go towards their new, unnamed project based on ancient Tamil legends. Another title awarded funding by the scheme was Project Dosa, from developer Outerloop, that sees players pilot giant robots, cook Indian food and fight lawyers. Its previous game, Thirsty Suitors, was also highly praised and nominated for a Bafta award this year. Games such as these resonating with players worldwide helps perceptions from the wider industry, says Mumbai-based Indrani Ganguly, of Duronto Games. “Finally, people are starting to see we’re not just a place for outsource work,” she says. “We’re moving from India being a technical space to more of a creative hub. “I’m not 100% seeing a shift but that’s more of a mindset thing. ""People who are able to make these kinds of games have always existed but now there is funding and resource opportunities available to be able to act on these creative visions.” British-Indian game developer Charu Desodt believes the success of titles such as Venba has been thanks to their commitment to authenticity. “They make me feel very proud,"" she says. ""We’re coming to a point where the industry is growing massively, both in terms of hours spent gaming but more importantly in the variety of the games. ""When you have authentic local stories told from the heart, that’s something everyone can relate to.” Charu says funding for ""unique and quirky stories has been an issue"" but recent successes such as Venba and Thirsty Suitors have shown there is an appetite for south Asian stories told by south Asian developers. Some of the industry's biggest companies are also paying attention. Last year, Sony launched its India Hero Project with a goal to “unearth and empower India’s brightest game development talents” via mentorship and funding. Its first cohort of games included slice-of-life games Fishbowl, museum exploration game Mukti and rhythm-action game Suri: the Seventh Note, inspired by mythical Indian stories from the Himalayas to Rajasthan. Meanwhile french publishing giant Ubisoft’s Indie Series has supported Thousand Star Studios in creating Aikyam – a Bollywood-inspired fantasy roleplaying game set to be released this year. Charu says video games and their interactivity allow people to “understand a concept on a very deep level."" “It’s not just about me appreciating my south Asian roots but its about other people really connecting with the authenticity of that experience,” says Charu. “It takes time for an industry to evolve and mature,"" she says. ""We’re in the early days as an industry as a whole, even in the west. ""But people now have access to technology and India is also a nation that loves to tell stories.” Listen to Ankur Desai's show on BBC Asian Network live from 15:00-18:00 Monday to Thursday - or listen back here.

bbc,Forty Indians among 50 dead in Kuwait block fire,5 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9ww0j74rddo,"At least 40 Indians are among 50 people killed in a fire at a residential building in the Kuwaiti city of Mangaf, India's foreign ministry has said. The fire broke out on Wednesday in a building where dozens of workers stayed. Video shared on social media showed flames engulfing the lower part of the building and thick black smoke billowing from the upper floors. Most of the casualties are from the southern Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Around 50 Indians have also been injured. Three Filipinos have also been killed, AFP quoted Philippines officials as saying. Filipino and Nepali workers are also among the injured. Two-thirds of the Kuwaiti population is made up of foreign workers and the country is highly dependent on migrant labour, especially in the construction and domestic sectors. Human rights groups have regularly raised concerns over their living conditions. Local media reports said the building housed 196 workers and there are suggestions that it may have been overcrowded. A senior police officer told state TV that there were a ""large number"" of people in the building at the time of the fire. ""Dozens were rescued, but unfortunately there were many deaths as a result of inhaling smoke from the fire,"" he said, adding that warnings were often issued about overcrowding in this type of accommodation. Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Fahad Yusuf al-Sabah accused property owners of greed and said violations of building standards had led to the tragedy. ""Unfortunately the greed of the property owners is what led to this,"" Sheikh al-Sabah, who is also acting interior minister, told Reuters news agency. ""They violate regulations and this is the result of the violations,"" he said. The original death toll was 49 but Foreign Minister Abdullah Al-Yahya said on Thursday that one person had died overnight, AFP reported. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sent his condolences to the victims and their families. ""The fire mishap in Kuwait City is saddening,"" he said on X. ""My thoughts are with all those who have lost their near and dear ones. I pray that the injured recover at the earliest."" He said the Indian embassy was monitoring the situation and working with the authorities on the ground. Kirti Vardhan Singh, a junior minister in the government who left for Kuwait on Thursday morning, said DNA tests were being carried out to identify the victims. ""An Air Force plane is on the ready. As soon as the bodies are identified, the kin will be informed and our Air Force plane will bring the bodies back,"" he told news news agency ANI. Twenty-four victims are from Kerala state while five are from neighbouring Tamil Nadu. An eyewitness, Manikandan from Tamil Nadu, told BBC Tamil that many of the workers had been on night shifts. ""Some of those who returned to that apartment early in the morning were cooking food after coming back from work,"" he said. ""Once the fire erupted, it spread rapidly. People living in the building were not able to control the fire."" Back home in India, the families of the victims who have been identified are in shock. Umaruddeen Shameer from Kerala's Kollam district worked as a driver for an oil company in Kuwait. His family is stunned after hearing about his death, said a neighbour who picked up the phone at his house. ""He was married just nine months ago when he came on a visit here,"" the neighbour told BBC Hindi without disclosing his identity. ""His parents are not in a condition to speak to anyone."" Another victim, Stephin Sabu, 29, was set to travel home to Kerala's Kottayam district next month, an acquaintance of the family told BBC Hindi. ""His father is unwell and his mother is not able to speak,"" Babu Mathew, a member of the local church, told BBC Hindi, adding that his family had been waiting for Sabu's arrival for the housewarming ceremony of the house that he had built. Others who were waiting desperately for news of their loved ones were left distressed. Earlier on Thursday, Ashrafunnisa from Villupuram in Tamil Nadu had shared her worries about not being able to contact her husband Mohammed Sharief. He was working as a foreman in Kuwait for the past decade and lived in the building which was destroyed. “I last spoke to him on Tuesday afternoon. I haven’t been able to get through to him since then,"" she said. Hours after speaking to the BBC, she got the news of his death. Additional reporting by BBC Tamil Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,The US cricket star who once played for India,7 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511x170v2wo,"In 2015, Saurabh Netravalkar gave up his dreams of playing professional cricket in India and moved to the US to work as a software engineer. “Cricket was over for me. I had no hope or expectation left to play again,” he says. On Wednesday, almost a decade later, he will face the Indian cricket team in a T20 World Cup match at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, New York. But he will do so as part of the US team. As he embarks on his World Cup dream, Netravalkar says the match will be an ""emotional moment"" for a cricketer who once played for India’s Under-19 team. “Many of my former team-mates are now playing for India,” he tells the BBC. But he is unfazed about the prospect of facing his friends in a crucial match. He is full of confidence and it showed in his impeccable bowling last week in a super over that led the US to a historic win against Pakistan. Netravalkar’s is a story of persistence, a love for cricket and, also, the American dream. Born and raised in Mumbai, Netravalkar began playing cricket when he was just 10. His family lived in Malad, a suburb in the western part of the city. After some remarkable performances as a teenager, he was picked to represent India in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand. The tall, left-arm fast bowler emerged as the leading wicket-taker of the tournament for the Indian team. Over the next few years, Netravalkar balanced his pursuit of cricket while studying to become an engineer, graduating in 2013. After that, the bowler says he decided to concentrate on cricket, giving himself two years. During this time, he attempted to get a spot in the national team as well as the Mumbai cricket team. “I got into the [Mumbai] squad too. But I couldn’t cement my place or even get into the Indian Premier League (IPL),” he says. A cricketer’s career usually starts at 23. But Netravalkar says he decided to leave the sport at that point. “I was in two minds. Should I pursue cricket or concentrate on studies?” he says. In 2015, he started studying in Cornell University in the US for a degree in computer science. “It was a difficult decision,” he says. But he could never fully let go of his cricket dreams. During his time as an engineering student in India, he’d already developed CricDeCode, an app to help cricketers analyse their game. At Cornell, Netravalkar saw students play cricket and joined a club to participate in inter-college tournaments. Soon after graduating, Netravalkar got a job with software giant Oracle and moved to California. In San Francisco, Netravalkar began playing club cricket. “They had weekend tournaments. I would work for five days and play on Saturday and Sunday.” It was far from professional cricket, but it was still a chance to play the game. “San Francisco still doesn’t have proper pitches. They play on an artificial pitch that’s more like a synthetic mat,” he says. “But they had soil pitches in a park in Los Angeles - it’s like the Maidan [a famous park] in Mumbai.” Every Friday evening, he would drive for six hours to Los Angeles to play a match on Saturday. Then he’d drive back to play a match in San Francisco on Sunday. “In the club [in Los Angeles], there were three to four players who were part of the American team,” he says. “It was then I got to know that America had a cricket team.” “On long weekends, they organised tournaments in the country, mostly in Florida, where even players from the West Indies would participate.” Those tournaments provided a good platform, but Netravalkar was still not dreaming of playing for the US national team. “I was on a student visa and then a work visa. So there was no question of playing for the team.” The International Cricket Council (ICC), which governs the sport across the world, also had a rule that required Netravalkar to have lived in the US for seven years and be a permanent resident. But the rule changed in 2018 and Netravalkar was picked for the US cricket team. In 2019, the ICC also gave international T20 status to all its associate members, including the US. “Many think it’s easier to play for obscure teams that are considered underdogs,” he says. “But the struggle is even harder here. Playing for associate countries is difficult because they lack basic infrastructure,” he explains. All players in the US team also have full-time jobs and juggle family responsibilities. ""So we practise indoors from 7-9pm.” In a country like the US, distance adds to the struggle of bringing players from different corners to play together. So the team usually meets 10 days before a tournament to practice. The US overcame these odds to progress from the upper divisions of associate cricket to playing the T20 World Cup this year. They have already qualified for the 2026 World Cup. “The standard of local cricket here has gone up,” Netravalkar says. “Major league and minor league made a huge difference because they gave us a chance to play with top players. There are better grounds being made and pitches are improving.” Cricket academies in the country are also nurturing new players. Even as fan following for the sport grows in places like California, Netravalkar says US cricket faces a tough road ahead. “There’s only one tournament in a year where you play five matches in seven days. So all our efforts throughout the year are tested in just those five days.” “If you win, then you can go ahead. Or else there’s nothing.” Before this T20 World Cup, the US beat Bangladesh in a series which boosted their confidence. Then, in the first game of this tournament, they defeated Canada before going on to upset Pakistan. Netravalkar is now preparing to face his old team-mates from India in the match on Wednesday. “It is nice to reconnect with them and I’m happy for what they have achieved - for India and in the IPL,” he says. Despite facing a star-studded team, Netravalkar is optimistic about his team’s chances. “They [India] practise for hours and we had very limited resources. But anything can happen in T20,” he says. “We are positive. We will give our best in those three hours.” Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Two Indians recruited by Russia killed in Ukraine,7 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv225e8dpdgo,"India says two of its nationals who had been recruited by the Russian army have been killed in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The Indian foreign ministry said it had urged the Russian authorities to repatriate the bodies of the two deceased. The ministry has also urged Moscow to quickly release and return all Indian nationals who are with the Russian army. Moscow is yet to comment. Dozens of Indians have reportedly been duped by agents into fighting for Russian forces with the lure of money and a Russian passport. The BBC has spoken to some of them. Some said they were coerced into taking up combat roles in the Russian army. Others have also enlisted of their own accord. ""We regret to state that two Indian nationals who had been recruited by the Russian Army have recently been killed in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine,"" the foreign ministry statement said, without naming the victims. The ministry also urged Indian nationals to ""exercise caution while seeking employment opportunities in Russia"". In May Indian police arrested four people allegedly linked to a network of human traffickers on suspicion of luring young men to Russia with the promise of jobs or education, only to force them to fight in Ukraine. At least two other Indians died earlier this year while fighting for Russian forces. Despite urging Russia to return Indian nationals serving in the Russian army, India has refused to condemn the Kremlin over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, urging the two sides to seek peace through dialogue and diplomacy. Meanwhile Nepal and Sri Lanka have warned their citizens not to be lured in by the false promises of human traffickers in recent months, after it emerged that hundreds of their nationals were taking part in the war as mercenaries. Kathmandu says at least 20 Nepalese have died fighting for Russia. At least 16 former Sri Lankan soldiers have been killed in the conflict so far, most of them for the Russian army. Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry raised the issue with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Monday, the ministry said. It was agreed that ""no further recruitment from Sri Lanka will be done"", the ministry said. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Nine Hindu pilgrims killed in bus attack in India's Jammu,10 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggm5j0lzzo,"Nine people have died and 33 injured after suspected militants fired on a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims in the Indian federal territory of Jammu and Kashmir, police officials said. Officials had initially said after the incident on Sunday that the death toll was 10, but revised the figure later. They said that the driver lost control after the attack, causing the bus to plunge into a gorge in Reasi district of Jammu. While rescue operations have concluded, a search operation by the Indian army and police is under way to track down the attackers.  Officials said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken ""stock of the situation"" and asked for the best medical care to be provided to the injured. ""All those behind this heinous act will be punished soon,"" Manoj Sinha, the region's top administrator, wrote on X (formerly Twitter). Mr Sinha has announced a compensation of 1m rupees ($12000; £9400) to the next of kin of the deceased and 50,000 rupees to the injured. The bus was on its way to the base camp of the famous Hindu shrine of Mata Vaishno Devi when it was fired upon. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack yet but Mohita Sharma, the district police chief, told Reuters that suspected militants had ""ambushed the bus"". The Himalayan region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for over six decades. Since 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two wars over the Muslim-majority territory, which both claim in full but control in part. Since 1989, Indian-administered Kashmir has also seen an armed insurgency against Delhi's rule, claiming thousands of lives. Delhi accuses Islamabad of harbouring militants and disrupting peace in the region, a charge Pakistan denies. The news of the attack broke as Mr Modi took oath as India's prime minister for the third consecutive term at a swearing-in ceremony in Delhi. On Monday, the Jammu police released the names of the victims, including the driver of the bus. They are from the states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Two of the victims are children, aged two years and 14. Some survivors spoke to ANI news agency about their ordeal. One of them said the driver had been shot and that the firing didn't stop even after the bus fell into the gorge. Amit Shah, who was home minister in Mr Modi's previous government, expressed grief over the incident. ""The culprits of this dastardly attack will not be spared and will face the wrath of the law,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Rahul Gandhi, the leader of main opposition party Congress, questioned the security situation in the region. ""This shameful incident is the true picture of the worrying security situation in Jammu and Kashmir,"" he wrote on X. In 2017, seven Hindu pilgrims, six of them women, were killed after their bus, returning from the famed Amarnath pilgrimage site in Anantnag district, got caught in a gun battle between police and militants.

bbc,Narendra Modi sworn in for third term at grand ceremony in Delhi,9 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggnm7r75yo,"Narendra Modi has been sworn in as India's prime minister for a third term in a grand ceremony at the presidential palace in Delhi. The leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party took his oath, saying he would ""do right to all manner of people without affection or ill-will"". Mr Modi's BJP-led National Democratic Alliance won the general election with 293 seats, a much lower margin than predicted by exit polls. The election saw a resurgence of India's opposition, which won 234 seats. Thousands of guests have been attending his inauguration at Delhi's presidential palace. Among them are the heads of neighbouring Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives - but not Pakistan or China. Tight security has been in place in Delhi, which was declared a no-fly zone, with more than 2,500 police officers deployed around the venue. Speaking as he was sworn in by President Draupadi Murmu, Mr Modi said he would uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India and govern with ""true faith and allegiance to the constitution"". He said: ""I will do right to all manner of people in accordance with the constitution and the law without fear or favour."" A council of ministers of Mr Modi's new cabinet were also sworn in during the ceremony. Mr Modi, 73, is only the second Indian leader to win a third consecutive term after the country’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Exit polls had projected outright victory for his Hindu Nationalist BJP party, which ruled India for a decade, but it lost its parliamentary majority in the general election. His NDA bloc relied on two key allies, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the Janata Dal (United) JD(U), to cross the 272-seat mark needed to form the government. On Friday, the elected MPs voted Mr Modi as the leader of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the parliament), leader of the BJP parliamentary party, and leader of the NDA. It is not clear what concessions his allies may have negotiated in return for their support. India media report that several are seeking key ministerial posts. The opposition INDIA alliance, led by the Congress party, has called the election a mandate against Mr Modi's government. Mr Modi, however, countered this on Friday, saying: ""Opposition tried to paint 2024 Lok Sabha results as a loss for us. But we didn’t lose, we never lost, we will never lose."" Mr Modi thanked voters for their mandate, and said he would ""do everything"" to eradicate corruption and poverty. ""Empowering the poor and middle class is our priority,"" he said. During his election campaign, Mr Modi and his party were accused by critics of using hate speech, attacking the country's Muslim minority, and jailing opposition figures. On Friday, the prime minister-elect said the NDA alliance was ""committed to the principle of ""sarva panth sambhava"" (religious equality). The INDIA alliance has said it will fulfil its duty in parliament by holding the government in check and protecting the constitution. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Will coalition turn domineering Modi into a humbler leader?,9 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn00xl6n8ldo,"India is no stranger to coalition governments. Some of the world’s largest coalitions, comprising between six and a dozen parties, have been formed in the world's most populous democracy. From 1989 to 2004, six general elections produced no single-party majority. Some of these coalitions have been particularly chaotic: between 1989 and 1999, eight were formed and many quickly collapsed. But some of India’s most significant economic reforms and highest growth rates have come under coalition governments, led by both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Now, for the first time since 2014, India will have a coalition government, with no single-party majority. Narendra Modi of the BJP, set for a third term as prime minister, has seen his majority reduced by a resurgent opposition, and now primarily relies on two allies in his National Democratic Alliance (NDA) for a parliamentary majority. But will Mr Modi, who always ruled with a majority as chief minister of Gujarat state and as India’s prime minister, and dominated politics for a decade, be able to run a coalition? Can he shed his domineering style and carry disparate regional allies along? And will he curb a growing personality cult stoked by his party and a friendly media to adopt a more consensual, humbler image? Many believe it's unlikely to be smooth sailing for Mr Modi in a coalition. The two allies that Mr Modi is most dependent on are two regional parties, Janata Dal (United) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP). They have 28 seats between them. Both are led by veteran, astute leaders - Nitish Kumar and N Chandrababu Naidu, respectively - who have previously served in BJP-led federal coalition governments and then quit over differences with the ruling party, specifically over Mr Modi. In 2019, while serving as Andhra Pradesh chief minister, Mr Naidu labeled Mr Modi, then his political rival, a ""terrorist"". Politics makes for strange bedfellows - India is no stranger to that fact. Coalition governments dependent on just two or three allies are particularly vulnerable to collapse if even one withdraws support. Many believe a coalition government under Mr Modi could contribute to a healthier democracy. They say it could reduce the prime minister's dominance, decentralise governance, increase checks and balances, embolden the opposition, and make institutions like the bureaucracy, judiciary and media more independent. Atal Behari Vajpayee, one of the BJP’s stalwarts, ran a successful multi-party coalition government from 1998 to 2004. The avuncular leader privatised state-owned firms, facilitated foreign investment, built expressways, relaxed trade barriers, and even ignited an IT revolution. He ended a decades-old moratorium on nuclear tests, eased tensions with Pakistan and built closer ties with US. Much of this had to do with Mr Vajpayee’s consensual style. But Mr Modi’s coalition is vastly different from the ones in the past. Despite securing fewer than the 272 seats needed for a majority government, the BJP still took 240 seats, so remains an influential and dominant coalition leader. And in the past, successful minority governments have been run with even less seats. Congress were able to run a successful minority government with 232 seats in 1991- and with just 145 and 206 seats in 2004 and 2009. Furthermore, Mr Modi leads an aggressive and revamped BJP. Amit Shah, his closest confidant, embodies a redefined top leadership that Congress leader Shashi Tharoor characterises as a ""my way or the highway"" approach to governance. In the past, BJP-led coalitions put the party’s key ideological and polarising issues on the backburner to accommodate the demands of their allies. Much of the party's agenda – revoking the autonomy of Kashmir, building the Ram temple – has already been achieved under Mr Modi's leadership. Will his allies now urge him to tone down his divisive rhetoric, particularly against Muslims, which he used freely during the election campaign? Effective coalition politics demands collective action to function as a bloc and offer checks and balances. The key question now is what major issues the coalition partners and the BJP can agree upon. Mr Modi’s party has been pushing for a controversial plan to hold simultaneous federal and state elections, something India gave up in 1967. His party has also promised an Uniform Civil Code or UCC, a single personal law for all citizens, irrespective of religion, sex, gender and sexual orientation. This has been resisted in the past by both the country’s majority Hindus and minority Muslims. Then there’s the delicate issue of redrawing of parliamentary boundaries, due after 2026. The wealthier, less populated southern states fear that Mr Modi will expand parliament, with the seat count favouring the poorer, more populous Hindi heartland states - a traditional BJP stronghold. Mr Modi will also have to listen to regional and state-specific demands from the allies and accommodate their leaders' ambitions. Both the TDP and JD(U) have demanded special status for their states, which mean more federal funds. The allies, according to media reports, are also eyeing influential ministries. Despite a rebounding economy fuelled by government spending, Mr Modi needs to create more jobs and boost incomes for the poor and middle class. India’s economy requires many structural reforms in agriculture, land and labour. Mr Modi may need a consultative approach with allies to achieve any of this. For a man used to basking in the spotlight, consensual politics may not come easily to Mr Modi, many believe. ""He has suddenly been asked to enact a role that he has never done before in his life,"" says Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a biographer of the prime minister . But successful politicians master the art of reinvention. Will India now see a humbler, more consultative and consensual Mr Modi? “We will have to wait and see,” says Sandeep Shastri, a political analyst. “We have to view this through the lens of current circumstances, not past alliances.” Watch this space.

bbc,The temple storming still affecting Sikhs today,8 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw99rgv397go,"Members of the Sikh community have been recalling what their families endured during one of the most brutal periods in the history of their faith. It is 40 years since Indian armed forces stormed the Golden Temple in Amritsar in Punjab, to remove Sikh separatists who were demanding an independent homeland, called Khalistan. About 400 people, including 87 soldiers, were killed during Operation Blue Star, which was ordered by then prime minister, Indira Gandhi. But Sikh groups dispute this figure, claiming thousands died. Sikhs across the world accused troops of desecrating the faith's holiest shrine, and tensions led to an armed insurgency lasting more than a decade. Here, Sikhs in Bedfordshire recount how the events of June 1984 have left lasting scars. Rasal Singh is a volunteer in the Sikh temple in Luton, and runs a business in Bedfordshire. His father, Nirmal Singh Chola Sahib, was killed in November 1990. He said: ""My father was arrested and taken to the local police station where he was tortured severely... It was tragic, he was brutally tortured."" The father of three said his family ""still suffer today"". ""The pain is still so raw, the absence of my father has left a void that never truly heals he was tortured and killed, it’s left a huge hole in my heart,"" he said. ""After my dad was killed, my family became homeless, moving from place to place. Even after 40 years, my family is still hurting, and no justice has been served. ""I channel my pain into being a better parent, hoping to give them the sense of completeness that I missed. ""Every hug, every word of encouragement, every moment spent with them is a step towards healing."" Gurjit Singh, from Luton, said his uncle, Paramjit Singh, was a police officer in Punjab before he was killed in the 1990s. He said: ""Innocent people were often tortured and targeted simply for wearing turbans or having beards. ""The police frequently harassed women under false pretences."" He said his uncle became a target for harassment himself while trying to protect a group of women from his colleagues. ""They even targeted his family, including my father, who was also a police officer,"" he said. ""My uncle had to flee the village, but eventually, they found him, tortured him in jail for 10 days, and then killed him in the fields, staging his death as an escape attempt."" He said that his uncle fled, the whole family was arrested, including children and grandparents. One family member was nine months' pregnant and was denied medical care, suffering a stillbirth. “Today after 40 years of fighting for justice, we still don’t have it,"" Mr Singh said. ""Even political parties did not intervene. ""Punjab was in a state of lawlessness and danger. Our family has been shattered, and three generations have been unable to live a normal life."" Harjinder Singh, from Bedford is a Sikh Activist for Sovereign Roots. The campaign group provides education toolkits on the Sikh religion and political history of Punjab from the times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. He said: ""As we mark 40 years since the tragic attack on Sri Darbar Sahib in Amritsar, we remember the thousands of lives lost, including men, women, and children. ""An entire generation has been killed, leaving families and the global Sikh community in enduring pain. ""Today, we find ourselves with no refuge or voice to hear our pleas for justice. The memories of our lost loved ones demand that we seek an independent country, free from the oppression we have faced in India."" Follow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

bbc,India opposition accuses Modi of 'stock market scam',7 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cekkddndldeo,"Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has demanded an investigation into a stock market crash that hit investors at the end of the general election. He accused top Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders of making misleading predictions about stock prices surging after 4 June, the day the results were announced. Mr Gandhi, from the Congress party, claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi encouraged people to buy stocks before this, which led to them losing money when the market crashed. Mr Modi's party, the BJP, has denied the allegations. Mr Gandhi has demanded that a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigate the alleged scam and the role of Mr Modi and senior ministers. He alleged that weeks before election results, Mr Modi, ex-Home Minister Amit Shah, and former Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman advised people to ""buy stocks before 4 June"", suggesting that the market would surge after, anticipating a BJP victory. In May, Mr Shah told NDTV news channel in an interview: ""Stock market crashes should not be linked with elections, but even if such a rumour has been spread, I suggest that you buy (shares) before 4 June. It will shoot up."" Mr Gandhi has labelled it ""the biggest scam"" in India's stock market history, alleging that the manipulation benefited certain ""dubious foreign investors"", causing Indians to lose trillions of rupees. Mr Modi's departing trade minister, Piyush Goyal, has refuted the allegations, accusing Mr Gandhi of misleading investors. Exit polls had predicted that the BJP would comfortably win a majority - securing more than 272 seats in the 543 member parliament - while together with its alliance partners, this figure would touch 360-370. However, the results were drastically different from these predictions, with the BJP failing to reach the halfway mark on its own and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) getting just 293 seats. Mr Gandhi has now claimed that the exit polls were ""fake"" and that the BJP knew that it was not going to win more that 220 seats ""from its internal survey and the feedback from the intelligence agencies"". ""Despite that, the exit polls were made to show that the BJP was winning a large number of seats,"" Mr Gandhi alleged. This, he alleged, led to massive buying of stocks on 3 June. When the results came out the next day, the Indian stock market saw one of its worst crashes in years, with investments worth billions of dollars being wiped out. The BJP's Mr Goyal said that it was Indians who gained from the rise and fall in stock prices, since in April and May, when the market was on an upswing, foreign investors had sold shares which Indians had bought. And this happened again on 4 June, when the market crashed, he said. ""So foreigners bought at a high price and sold at a low price. Indian investors sold at a high price and bought at a low price. So in a way, Indian investors earned even in this period. No one suffered a loss,"" he said. On Friday, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that Mr Goyal's explanation was ""rubbish"" and added that it did not answer specific questions raised by Mr Gandhi. The BJP has not responded to Mr Ramesh's allegations. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,India’s opposition looked down and out – now they’re back,5 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp00jze920eo,"The results of India’s general election announced on Tuesday are being interpreted in a rather unusual way. While the winners appear subdued, the runners-up are celebrating. The NDA alliance, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has won a historic third term in power, with more than 290 seats in the 543-member parliament. But his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on its own did not reach the magic figure of 272 seats needed to form the government – and the prime minister is now being seen as a much diminished leader. The outcome is being seen as a huge comeback for the opposition INDIA alliance and Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi, the face of the bloc. The alliance has won just over 230 seats and doesn’t have the numbers to cobble together a government – but more than 24 hours after counting of votes began, they were yet to concede. “It’s an extraordinary story,” political analyst Rashid Kidwai told the BBC. “The result is surprising. The opposition has managed to pull off the unexpected.” A jubilant Congress party called the verdict “a moral and political defeat for Mr Modi"", whose BJP had campaigned predominantly on his name and record. On Tuesday evening, Mr Gandhi told a press conference that “the country has unanimously sent a message to Mr Modi and [Home Minister] Amit Shah that we do not want you”. There’s a backdrop to this exuberance. Going into the election, the opposition seemed in complete disarray and the Congress-led INDIA bloc, made up of more than two dozen disparate regional parties, appeared to be on the verge of imploding. Experts questioned whether it was fit to challenge Mr Modi, who looked unstoppable at the time. And as the election neared, the opposition faced an uphill battle. Parties and leaders were raided by government agencies; two chief ministers – including Arvind Kejriwal of Delhi – were jailed; and bank accounts belonging to Congress were frozen by the income-tax authorities. The credit for the opposition’s performance, Mr Kidwai says, largely goes to Mr Gandhi, the much criticised scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. His great-grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru was the first and longest-serving prime minister of India. His grandmother and father also served as PM. “He’s a fifth generation dynast and came with a lot of historical baggage,” the political analyst explains. “The mainstream media in India was very hostile to him and social media didn’t take him seriously. He was targeted and projected as a non-serious politician who took too many holidays.” But, Mr Kidwai says, he overcame the odds and, in recent years, has worked hard to change that impression of himself and his party. “During his Bharat Jodo Yatra and the Nyay March through the length and breadth of the country, he met millions of people – which added to his stature and won him lots of support. It also gave him confidence and political heft.” But Mr Gandhi was still not perceived as a threat to Mr Modi. Last year, a court in Mr Modi’s home state Gujarat convicted the Congress leader of defamation. He was thrown out of parliament and barred from contesting elections – until the Supreme Court suspended his conviction. The perception that the BJP was seeking to go after the opposition, says political analyst and author Ajoy Bose, backfired. “The BJP got a bit arrogant and complacent. But their shock and awe tactics to intimidate the opposition worked against the BJP and led to the formation of the INDIA bloc.” The parties, he says, “were afraid they would be wiped off and many saw echoes of Emergency [a reference to the 1975 action of then-PM Indira Gandhi to suspend elections and curb civil rights] in the way the government was functioning”. India has “a history of competitive democracy”, Mr Bose says, adding that among the people “there was a sense of disquiet and discomfort about the country turning into a one-party dictatorship”. As the results show, the BJP juggernaut met strong resistance in several opposition-ruled states. In Tamil Nadu, the ruling DMK party kept the BJP out by winning all 39 seats in the state. In West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee fought to limit the BJP to 12 seats (Mr Modi’s party had won 18 of the 42 seats in 2019). In Maharashtra, the BJP was limited to nine seats – it had won 23 of the 48 seats in 2019 and its then-ally Shiv Sena had bagged a further 18. But the biggest upset for Mr Modi and the BJP, Mr Bose says, came from the bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh (UP). “Akhilesh Yadav and his Samajwadi Party (SP) is the biggest success story of this election. A very clever alliance with Rahul Gandhi won them 43 of the state’s 80 seats. The BJP’s tally has been restricted to a poor 33.” Mr Modi's party won 62 seats in 2019 and took 71 in 2014. In the run-up to the election, Mr Modi had described Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav as “a pair of boys” whose alliance had “flopped” many times in the past. But as the results show, this pair of boys soundly beat the BJP in UP. “A key takeaway from the election,” Mr Bose says, “is that the grand new Ram temple in Ayodhya city wasn’t enough for the BJP to win.” The party had banked on the Ram Mandir temple to be their trump card, with Mr Modi presiding over the opening of the unfinished temple in Ayodhya with much fanfare in January. But in the Faizabad constituency, where it is located, the BJP candidate lost. Abhishek Yadav, an SP youth-wing leader and a star campaigner for his party, told the BBC that initially they too believed that the temple would help the BJP win the key state. “Until early April, [the] election in the state had seemed like a one-sided contest with the odds stacked against us,” Mr Yadav told me recently. “But we sensed there was an undercurrent of resentment against the BJP when large numbers of people started gathering at our rallies.” People were unhappy about a lack of jobs and high food and fuel prices, he said. Many were also angry with the changes in how army soldiers are recruited. “With the Congress and SP fighting the election together as part of INDIA alliance, all anti-BJP voters came together to vote for us,” he added. Mr Kidwai says that – notwithstanding the surprisingly good performance of the opposition – in some ways, it was a missed opportunity, as the INDIA bloc failed to read the voters’ minds and did not sense the disquiet they felt with Mr Modi’s government. “They spoke about joblessness, rural economic distress and were able to win over many voters – but there were lots of gaps in their strategy,” he says. “The NDA’s third term has come only because of weaknesses in the INDIA bloc. They could have forged alliances in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and that would have made their tally stronger.” But now that the NDA – and Mr Modi – are back in power, INDIA needs to institutionalise its alliance and Mr Gandhi, “the chief architect of the alliance”, must lead from the front, Mr Kidwai adds. “It’s unlikely that the government will stop going after the opposition. But it also can’t be business as usual for the government. They cannot continue with their politics of vendetta; it will have to be toned down. “The strength of opposition in parliament would allow restoration of functional ties in parliament. There’s great need for coalition politics now. And Congress as the single largest opposition party in the coalition must lead from the front. “The Gandhis consider themselves as trustees of power, not power-wielders. But now the time has come to change. Rahul Gandhi has to take on the mantle of leadership and lead.” Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Full report: Stunning blow for Modi as alliance heads for reduced majority,4 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vv93pz14zo,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has claimed a historic third win in a row in the country's parliamentary elections, but his ruling alliance appears to have failed to win a large majority as predicted. He thanked voters and said he would continue the ""good work"" of the last decade. Mr Modi’s BJP-led alliance is leading in more than 290 of 543 seats up for grabs, well short of their target of 400. The Congress and other allied opposition parties have surprised observers, and are now expected to win more than 230. The results give the lie to a slew of exit polls at the weekend that showed the BJP-led NDA alliance on course for a super majority of two-thirds of parliament, which would have allowed it to make changes to the constitution.  In his first remarks since the election, though, the prime minister was keen to stress his historic third victory. ""I bow to the people for this affection and assure them that we will continue the good work done in the last decade to keep fulfilling the aspirations of people,"" he said on X. Speaking to supporters later, he described his victory as ""the biggest in the world"" and said he was ""very very happy today"". But Rahul Gandhi - leader of the opposition Congress party - told reporters  that Mr Modi and the BJP had been ""punished"" by voters at the ballot box. Analysts attribute the BJP's setback to rising prices, joblessness, a controversial army recruitment reform and Mr Modi's aggressive and divisive campaign, which may have alienated voters in parts of the country. Mr Modi had set a target of 370 seats for the BJP and 400 seats for his alliance. This was up from the 303 seats won by the BJP alone in the last general election in 2019. However, the BJP is no longer expected to get the 272 seats on its own that are needed for a majority in the lower house of parliament. This is a setback for the party and means - for the first time - Mr Modi would have to rely on smaller parties in the NDA  to push through its agenda. There has been speculation that Mr Gandhi might also try to form a government, but two key NDA parties have already pledged their support for the incumbent prime minister. Some of the major developments of the election include:  The election was seen by many as a referendum on Mr Modi's decade in office, during which he has transformed many aspects of life in India, so this would be a major upset. The mood in BJP offices around the country has been described by BBC reporters as ""sombre"". In contrast, at Congress headquarters, party workers have been celebrating. The Indian markets, meanwhile, have been showing jitters - falling more than 2% - testifying to the fact that it’s not been a runaway result so far for the governing alliance. An average 66% of voters took part in the election, official figures showed. It was the biggest such exercise the world has ever seen, with nearly a billion registered voters – about one in eight of the global population. Voting was staggered over seven rounds between 19 April and 1 June for security and logistical reasons. Much of the election took place in extreme and deadly heat as temperatures in parts of India soared to nearly 50C. The BJP and its rivals fought a fierce - at times vitriolic - campaign, with the prime minister denying that he was being divisive when he was accused by rivals of demonising Muslims. Mr Modi toured the country, pointing to his achievements in areas such as delivering welfare schemes and raising India’s global profile. Opposition parties highlighted cost of living issues, high unemployment - especially for young people - and fears that constitutional changes could disempower the disadvantaged. They also promised to stop India’s “slide into autocracy”. A number of opposition leaders and government critics have been jailed in recent years, including Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal who was taken into custody on corruption charges in April but later briefly released to allow him to campaign.

bbc,BBC India reporters on why some voters said no to Modi,4 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5113nvjevxo,"When Narendra Modi set his sights on a barnstorming victory - 400 out of 543 seats  for his alliance - few scoffed at the ambition. After all, the Indian prime minister and his BJP have been a largely unstoppable force since coming to power a decade ago. But while Mr Modi and his alliance are on course to win a majority, it is not quite the untouchable win he and his allies envisioned when counting began this morning. Below, BBC correspondents in India give their thoughts on why we arrived at results few expected - and what it could mean for the world's largest democracy going forward. Religion is a factor in every Indian election, and this one was no different. Mr Modi inaugurated a Hindu temple at a controversial site that had been disputed between Hindus and Muslims in January and this was expected to give his party a big boost during the election. But no one quite expected the BJP’s campaign to be as polarising as it was - or for some of the most aggressive comments to come from the very top. At a campaign rally in April, Mr Modi said: “When their (the opposition Congress) government was in power they had said Muslims have the first right on the nation’s wealth. This means they’ll collect the wealth and give it to whom? To those who have many children. To infiltrators.” Some analysts interpreted the remark as an attempt by Mr Modi to galvanise his conservative Hindu support base. But looking at the results from some key constituencies – the BJP candidate has lost in the temple city of Ayodhya -  it doesn’t appear to have had the desired effect. Questions are now being raised about using the Hindu card as a campaign tool, especially since what it seems to have achieved is the opposite - uniting Muslim minorities against the BJP. Marketing consultants have attributed Narendra Modi’s enduring popularity to his mastery of branding, transforming routine events into spectacles and astute messaging. “He strikes a deep chord with his aura of clarity and strength, speaks simultaneously to anxieties and aspirations, communicates using emotionally resonant metaphors, understands the power of branding key initiatives to generate a sense of activity and purpose and knows the power of enigmatic silence,” Santosh Desai, a well-known brand consultant, wrote in 2017. Over the years, Mr Modi also sold himself as a cultural icon engaging a diverse people both at home and abroad, cementing his status as an influential leader in Indian politics. A weak opposition and a largely friendly media helped him build his brand.  “He’s pop culture in 70% of this country,” a brand consultant said at a conclave last year. No longer. As results of the general elections show, Brand Modi is beginning to fray. Mr Modi has never underperformed and won less than a majority in all the elections he has fought so far. It has been different this time. Tuesday’s results show that some of the sheen may be wearing off and even Mr Modi is not immune to the vagaries of anti-incumbency. Since the July 2023 formation of the opposition INDIA alliance, a grouping of more than two dozen parties, the Modi-led government has been painting it as a ragtag bunch of self-serving leaders out to personally target Mr Modi and destroy the country. While the leaders of the ruling BJP, along with most analysts and pollsters, had for months been predicting an easy win for Mr Modi, the Congress-led opposition block  kept emphasising rural distress, inflation and rampant unemployment in its messaging and public meetings. ""The Constitution is in danger"" and the country’s “democratic institutions are under attack” under a “divisive” Mr Modi was their war cry. A 4,200 miles (6,700 km) long march by Rahul Gandhi, a senior leader of the Congress party, that began months before the elections was heavily panned for its timing, but analysts believe it enthused supporters and galvanised party cadres. The opposition also upped its social media reach and aggressively took on the BJP which has for a long time dominated the digital landscape in India. Mr Modi's BJP is still struggling to make a major impact in southern India, although its vote share is set to increase. It won 25 seats in Karnataka alone in 2019. But this time it is losing at least 10 seats in the same state to the Congress party. It is on the verge of doubling the four seats it won in Telangana and a couple of seats in Andhra Pradesh because of its alliance with the regional Telugu Desam Party, headed by the IT industry friendly Chandrababu Naidu. In Tamil Nadu, the regional DMK led alliance is on the verge of repeating its 2019 performance of a clean sweep. And in Kerala, the Communist government and the Congress-led front seem to have kept the BJP from the Lok Sabha. In short, the development focused welfare schemes of the non-BJP parties appear to be making a better connect with the aspirations of the voters down South. Mr Modi projected himself as the voice of the Global South – a leader who acted as a bridge between the developing and the developed world. The Indian PM’s global heft was grounded in the massive support he had at home. He provided a sense of continuity to global leaders and alliances. Mr Modi will now head a coalition government. He is likely to have bipartisan support on foreign policy, but he will have to take allies into confidence before taking crucial decisions that affect global politics. That might force him to slow down, and adopt a more consultative decision making policy. So far India has defiantly practised its policy of strategic autonomy in foreign affairs, and that might not change. But what will change is Mr Modi’s ability to take quick decisions on global affairs – something he often did without consulting his own allies or the opposition. Be it as Gujarat state chief minister or as prime minister in his last two terms, Narendra Modi has run a full majority BJP government. Coalition partners did come along to give a hand, but the government’s future was never in their hands. Current numbers clearly indicate the BJP is falling short of majority which means Mr Modi will seek support from allies. He has got used to running a centralised government and party under him which will have to change keeping the new reality in mind. He will need to be a lot more mindful of the concerns and sensitivities of coalition partners and that doesn’t come easy to him, one analyst noted. India is not new to coalition politics, but coalition governments are often prone to instability. So it would be a litmus test for both Mr Modi and the BJP over their adaptability to a changed scenario. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Heat kills more than 50 people in India in three days,3 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cprrv9zp8wyo,"More than 50 people have died in India over the past three days as a brutal heat spell continues to grip parts of the country. Around 33 people died in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh over the weekend due to the heat. These included people involved in the general election, including polling officials, security guards and sanitation staff - Saturday was the last phase of voting. In Odisha (Orissa) state, about 20 people died due to heat stroke, officials said. Every five years, India holds its general election in the summer months of April and May. But this year, the temperatures have been record-breaking, with the country experiencing frequent, more intense and longer heatwaves. The federal health ministry says that there have been at least 56 confirmed heat strokes deaths from 1 March to 30 May. About 24,849 heatstroke cases were reported during the period. However, state-wise figures suggest the actual number could be much higher. In Odisha, district authorities reported 99 suspected heat stroke deaths in the past 72 hours - of these, 20 cases have been confirmed, the state's Special Relief Commissioner said in a statement. In Uttar Pradesh, Navdeep Rinwa, chief electoral officer of the state, told reporters that the families of deceased election personnel would be given a monetary compensation of 1.5m rupees ($18,000; £14,000). Mr Rinwa said that a man who was standing in the queue to vote fainted because of the heat. “The voter was transported to a health facility, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival,” he said. Suspected heat-related deaths have also been reported from the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. India's National Centre for Disease Control calls heat strokes a ""life-threatening"" condition with a mortality rate of 40-64%. The heat in northern and central India and parts of the west has been unrelenting for the past two weeks, with maximum temperatures hovering around 45-46C for days at a stretch and even climbing up to 50C in some areas. However, India's weather department says that temperatures are likely to fall in the coming days due to the onset on the monsoon. Several regions are experiencing severe water and electricity shortages due to a rise in power consumption. Videos from capital Delhi show people jostling for water from water tankers. Many parts of the capital are also experiencing frequent power cuts. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,"India's Modi could win third term, polls predict",1 Jun 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgllg541xmxo,"India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to win a third consecutive term in office, exit polls suggest. Analysts warn the polls, released by various news agencies, have often been wrong in the past and are not impartial. However, they have placed Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as the frontrunner in the general election. The BJP, the main opposition Congress party and regional rivals battled it out in a fierce campaign over seven phases of polling. Results will be announced on 4 June. A party or coalition needs 272 seats in parliament to form a government. The BJP led-coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), will cross this target - according to exit polls, which forecast it being close to taking about two-thirds of the seats. In his first comments after voting ended, Mr Modi claimed victory without referring to the exit polls. ""I can say with confidence that the people of India have voted in record numbers to re-elect the NDA government,"" he wrote on X, without providing evidence of his claim. Prime Minister Modi came into this election with resounding popularity, but his main rival - the leader of the Indian National Congress, Rahul Gandhi - and a coalition of opposition parties gathered significant momentum through the course of the lengthy election campaign. Now an aggregate of six exit polls forecasts big wins for the BJP-led NDA, but such surveys are not always reliable. Though the individual numbers vary, they predict that the NDA will get between 355 and 380 seats. The INDIA bloc is expected to get between 125 and 165 seats, according to the Reuters news agency. On its own, the BJP may win about 327 seats, not quite meeting its 370-seat target. India is the world's most populous country, with 1.4 billion people, and holding a nationwide election is nothing short of a Herculean task. Some 969 million citizens were eligible to cast their ballot, which is equal to the populations of the US, Russia, Japan, Britain, Brazil, France and Belgium. Polling for the election, which concluded just hours ago, began on 19 April. The season was marked by fiery speeches by politicians (some of them controversial), numerous rallies, diatribes, jibes and propaganda as political parties looked to outsmart their opponents - on the ground and even online. And there wasn't a dearth of headline-making incidents. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's arrest in a liquor policy case days before polling began drew sharp criticism from opposition leaders and even sections of the media. Opposition leaders accused the BJP government of trying to silence rivals and deny them a level playing field - which the BJP denies. A court granted Mr Kejriwal bail on 10 May to campaign for the elections. However, he has to return to jail on 2 June. The election was also overshadowed by reports of politicians and party workers tampering with voting machines, Muslims being denied their right to vote in some areas and parties flouting the Model Code of Conduct - guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India (ECI) to ensure free and fair elections. Opposition leaders also accused the commission of not acting on their complaints against the BJP - an allegation the ECI has denied. The inauguration of the Ram temple, which was one of the BJP's biggest poll promises this election, and the government's welfare schemes are expected to benefit the ruling party. But the high unemployment rate and price rises, especially of food and fuel, were also at the top of many voters' minds. The election also came amid allegations from the opposition, activists and global rights organisations that Indian democracy is under threat. It is an issue that may have influenced the way people cast their votes. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Heat kills at least 15 in India as temperatures near 50C,31 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czddy30ezd5o,"Several people have died due to heat-related ailments over the past 24 hours as temperatures continue to soar in northern and central India. Ten fatalities were recorded at the government hospital in Odisha's Rourkela region on Thursday, authorities told Reuters news agency. Heat-stroke related deaths have also been reported from the states of Bihar, Rajasthan and Jharkhand and the national capital, Delhi. The searing heat comes as India is holding its general election, the results of which will be declared on 4 June. Mahendra Kumar, district magistrate of Bhojpur district in Bihar told the Times of India newspaper that three election officers and a policeman had died in the city on Thursday due to heat stroke. ""It was the hottest day, and despite having medical facilities at all centres, they collapsed. One home guard [volunteer policeman] became unconscious where he was staying,""  Mr Kumar said, adding that the man died in the hospital while being treated by doctors. He also said that around 30-40 people had been admitted to the same hospital on Thursday due to heat-related ailments. Hospitals in the region are recording a rise in admissions due to heat-related ailments. On Thursday, a labourer admitted with a heat stroke died while receiving treatment at a hospital in Delhi. India's National Centre for Disease Control calls heat strokes a ""life-threatening"" condition with a mortality rate of 40 to 64%. The heat in northern, central and parts of western India has been unrelenting for the past two weeks, with maximum temperatures hovering around 45-46C for days at a stretch and even climbing up to 50C in some areas. Several regions are experiencing severe water and electricity shortages due to a rise in consumption. The soaring temperatures have led to a surge in fires across India and  authorities are employing drones to monitor forest fires in Jammu and Kashmir. In the past week, capital Delhi and surrounding regions experienced record-breaking temperatures nearing 50C. Videos of residents in Delhi jostling for water from water tankers have been widely shared on social media. Many parts of the capital are also experiencing frequent power cuts. Officials are still investigating whether the recorded temperature of 52.9C in the Mungeshpur area on Wednesday was a result of a sensor malfunction at the nearby weather station. India saw a 55% rise in deaths due to extreme heat between 2000-2004 and 2017-2021, a study published in the medical journal, The Lancet, found. Exposure to heat also caused a loss of 167.2 billion potential labour hours among Indians in 2021, the study noted. While many parts of the country have regularly experienced heatwaves in summer, experts have said these are now becoming longer, more intense and frequent. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,India MP arrested in sex-abuse case upon return to country,31 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clkkzx1zyejo,"Police in India have arrested a lawmaker who fled the country after being accused of sexually abusing several women. Prajwal Revanna, who left India on 27 April, was arrested on his arrival from Germany in the southern city of Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) early on Friday. Mr Revanna has denied all the allegations against him. The 33-year-old MP belongs to the Janata Dal (Secular) party, which is an ally of PM Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party. Mr Revanna, who belongs to an influential political family, is seeking re-election from the Hassan constituency in the southern state of Karnataka. But shortly before voting in Hassan, thousands of USB sticks with videos of the MP allegedly abusing women circulated in Karnataka, sparking outrage. Mr Revanna did not comment on the videos, but an official from his office said that the videos had been doctored. He fled the country shortly after voting ended in his constituency. Reports say the police have registered three cases of sexual assault against the MP so far. A special police team set up by Karnataka Chief Minister K Siddaramaiah is investigating the cases. On 18 May, a special court had issued an arrest warrant against Mr Revanna, following an application moved by the special investigation team (SIT). Days before he was arrested, Mr Revanna had applied for anticipatory bail but a court on Thursday rejected his plea. After remaining missing for several weeks, Mr Revanna had released a video on 27 May in which he said that he would appear before the SIT on Friday. The video came out shortly after his grandfather, former Indian prime minister HD Deve Gowda, asked him to return to India and face the investigation. Mr Revanna's father, HD Revanna and uncle HD Kumaraswamy are both influential legislators in the Karnataka state assembly. HD Revanna is also accused of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation in a police complaint lodged by a former employee of the family. He was held for six days but freed on bail last month. He has also denied the allegations, calling them a political conspiracy. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,The Indian women trumpeting their caste on Instagram,31 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrrq9e2pelo,"Young women in small towns and villages across India are proudly trumpeting their caste identities on Instagram, making it the latest battleground for caste politics. The BBC tracked 100 accounts and spoke to a dozen such influencers across the caste divide to understand what's driving the trend. The camera focuses on a woman in a black dress. She is pointing a rifle at the sky with her hand on the trigger. ""Who are you?"" asks an accompanying voiceover. ""We are Brahmins,"" a voice responds. The woman smiles, and the sound of two gunshots is heard. This is just one of hundreds of Instagram Reels made by Shivi Dikshit, a 24-year-old from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh who shares short videos about her Brahmin caste with her 150,000 followers on Instagram. Hinduism's deeply hierarchical caste system, which dates back at least 3,000 years, puts Brahmins or priests at the top and Dalits (formerly untouchables) at the bottom. Caste-based discrimination has been illegal in India for decades, but the country's 200 million Dalits continue to find themselves among the most marginalised citizens. Despite reforms, caste also remains a strong marker of identity in everyday conversations in many parts of the country. In the videos, which are shot at home and have more than a million views, Ms Dikshit talks about the ""superiority"" of Brahmins as she pours scorn on the notion of inter-caste relations and rejects affirmative policies aimed at empowering Dalits. ""Brahmins have a cultural upbringing [unlike other caste groups]. Everyone in my family is a practising priest. I want to propagate the values we practice and dispel myths about my community,"" she tells me while sitting on the terrace of her family-owned temple in the northern town of Meerut. Ms Dikshit is among the thousands of Indian women who are using Instagram to talk about their caste in new and imaginative ways. Most of them are from small towns and villages - unusual in a country where, unlike men, very few women speak publicly about their religious and caste identities. But access to social media, they say, has given them a platform to freely express themselves and challenge patriarchal controls. A study done by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) between 2014 and 2019 notes there has been a ""democratisation of the social media space"" in India, especially among the ""less educated and those living in rural areas"". And it's not just women from privileged castes - the strident views of those like Ms Dikshit have met a fightback from the Dalit community. Seemi Milind Jadhav, a 22-year-old beautician, goes by the name Bhimachi Sherni on Instagram. It's a reference to Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, a Dalit icon and the architect of India's constitution, while Sherni means lioness in Urdu. ""I look upon Ambedkar as a father figure. So, I am my father's lioness,"" she says. Ms Jadhav, who lives on the outskirts of India's financial capital Mumbai, says she began making Reels after coming across ""myths and disinformation being spread by upper-caste handles on Instagram"". ""I started educating myself about Ambedkar's teachings and caste politics, slowly I found a whole community of like-minded Dalits online,"" she told me. ""We now brainstorm and come up with our own Reels in response."" Most of the women the BBC spoke to said they made their online debut on the Chinese app TikTok and moved to Instagram after India banned it in 2020. The content they share is wide-ranging, but recurring themes include descriptions of ""the ideal"" Brahmin or Dalit man and a strong rejection of inter-caste marriages. These opinions can seem contrarian to a modern image of India - but data shows it's not uncommon. A Pew Research Center survey in 2019-2020 had more than 60% of respondents say it was important to stop both men and women in their community from marrying into other castes. These influencers also highlight the fault lines in a country marked by religious and social divisions. Brahmin women speak of uniting Brahmins and the Hindu community to contribute ""to the building of the Hindu nation"". But Dalit women like Ms Jadhav oppose the idea. They say if that happens, the strides the community has made in accessing education, employment and a life of dignity will be halted, pushing Dalits back to the margins. Hilal Ahmed, an assistant professor at CSDS, says the trend shows how women are rejecting popular assumptions that they are not interested in politics. ""Women are seen as bearers of culture and tradition that are derived from caste and religion,"" he explains. ""It is not surprising that now that they have a medium to express themselves, they want to own those identities and share their opinion about them."" But he adds that in the name of pride, these women are often perpetuating existing social divides. ""It's a paradox. They assert a sense of victimhood that their communities are under threat while also claiming that they don't fear anyone."" Some of the content shared is also provocative, with Reels bordering on hate speech and violence. The BBC contacted Meta about a few such videos, following which the company took them down from the platform. A Meta spokesperson said the company's community standards prohibit content targeting a person or group of people on the basis of their caste which is ""a protected characteristic"". ""Any content that threatens or incites violence is also prohibited,"" the spokesperson added. The women, however, dismiss allegations of casteism and violence and claim they are only trying to unite their community. Samiksha Sharma, who describes herself as Brahmin on Instagram, says she is often accused of ""dividing people"" and receives hostile comments ""However, I don't see it that way,"" the 24-year-old adds. ""I take inspiration from other Brahmin handles and promote our community."" In a country where millions of young adult women cannot even own a mobile phone without their parents' permission, Ms Jadhav says the platform allows her to navigate patriarchy through technology. When she first began making Reels in 2019, she did not tell her parents, recording them secretly at a salon where she worked to support her family. But she says the solidarities she built with women online gave her the courage to tell them the truth and assert her identity. ""They were shocked but proud that I was doing this for the community. So now I don't need to hide."" Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.

bbc,Varanasi: The ancient city at the heart of India’s election,30 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-69072682,"Varanasi is one of the world’s oldest cities and it’s often called India’s spiritual capital.

bbc,Absconding India MP to return to face sex abuse cases,29 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx99gkpwgq8o,"An Indian lawmaker who fled the country after being accused of sexual assault is set to return this week, more than a month after thousands of USB sticks with videos of the alleged abuse were circulated in his home state. Prajwal Revanna, an MP from Hassan district in Karnataka who is seeking re-election, had left India on 27 April using his diplomatic passport after the videos went viral. This week, he posted a video from an undisclosed location, saying he would return to India on 31 May to appear before a police team investigating the charges. He has denied the allegations of rape and sexual abuse, terming them a “political conspiracy”. Mr Revanna belongs to an influential political family - he is the grandson of former Indian prime minister HD Deve Gowda, who is the leader of the state's politically powerful Vokkaliga community. His Janata Dal (Secular), or JD (S) party, is an ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Prajwal Revanna's father HD Revanna and uncle HD Kumaraswamy are both influential legislators in the Karnataka state assembly. HD Revanna is also accused of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation in the police complaint lodged by a former employee of the family. He was arrested for six days but freed on bail last month. He has also denied the allegations, calling them a political conspiracy. In the past month while Mr Revanna was absent, fear and disquiet have gripped Hassan, which has been a stronghold of his family for decades. “It is too embarrassing to speak about what happened here,” a young shopkeeper in the district told the BBC. Roopa Hassan, a women's rights activist working in the state, says a lot of families have left the district over the past month. ""Many haven't come out of their houses for weeks,"" she said. The allegations against Mr Revanna first came to light in June last year, but he obtained a court order preventing media from reporting what was described as ""morphed videos"". But five days before the 26 April election in Hassan, thousands of pen drives were circulated in public places such as bus stands and parks. They contained 2,960 clips, which reports say were shot by Mr Revanna himself, and showed the faces of the women. On 28 April, one of the survivors lodged a police complaint, accusing Mr Revanna of raping her between 1 January 2021 and 25 April 2024 in his official government bungalow. She alleged that the politician had recorded the assault on his phone and used it to blackmail her and that he threatened her and her husband with a gun if she did not ""obey"" him. Mr Revanna did not address any of these direct allegations in his video. The couple, who said they had been “loyal” JD(S) party workers for decades, have alleged that they were forced to leave Hassan since their police complaint. The state government formed a special investigation team to look into the charges against Mr Revanna after another woman approached the women’s commission with similar accusations. Since then, police have received two more complaints of rape against the MP. On 1 May, Mr Revanna's lawyer told the SIT that he would not be able to participate in the inquiry since he was not in the country. In a social media post the same day, Mr Revanna also sought a week’s time to appear before investigators, saying that the “truth will prevail soon”. But he didn't return to India in a week. In May, the state government wrote to the federal foreign ministry twice, asking it to cancel Mr Revanna’s diplomatic passport. Foreign Minister S Jaishankar responded saying the request had been received late and that action was initiated on the request on 23 May. The case has sparked a political storm in Karnataka with the state's governing Congress party and the opposition blaming each other over who should have taken action against Mr Revanna when the videos surfaced. A state minister accused the BJP of fielding Mr Revanna for the election despite knowing that ""hundreds of women had been abused by the candidate"". Some reports said that the BJP’s state leaders had warned party leaders in Delhi about Mr Revanna's alleged misconduct. Meanwhile in Hassan, people remain reluctant to discuss the case, with two female students called it “disgusting”. “Boys in our college are talking about it. But we feel repulsed and don't even want to listen to what happened,"" one of them said. ""People switch off their TV sets now because they only show this shameful episode,” a resident who did not want to be named said. “We are sick of this. This has given the district such a bad name."" Mr Gowda and Mr Kumaraswamy have distanced themselves from the controversy and made several public appeals for Prajwal Revanna to return to the country. Last week, Mr Kumaraswamy apologised to party workers on behalf of the family. ""Be assured that I shall do everything possible to fight for your cause,"" he said. But a senior JD(S) worker, who wanted to stay anonymous, told the BBC that party workers were “depressed and upset’’ over the allegations. “We were all like an extended family of Mr Deve Gowda,"" she said.

bbc,The Indian state holding the key to PM Modi's re-election,29 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqee449yl5lo,"As India votes to elect a new government, all eyes are on the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, commonly known by its initials UP. Spread over an area roughly the size of Britain, the state packs in nearly four times as many people. With an estimated 257 million people, it is India’s most populous state and would be the fifth largest in the world if it was an independent country after India, China, United States and Indonesia and ahead of Pakistan or Brazil. The state is among just three in India which are voting in all seven phases in the elections which are spread over 44 days. (Voting ends on 1 June and results will be announced on 4 June.) So, it’s no surprise that UP - which elects 80 MPs in the 543-member lower house of parliament (the Lok Sabha) - is considered key to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s re-election bid as he seeks to return for a third consecutive term. “It’s commonly said that ‘the way to Delhi is through UP’ and a party that does well in the state generally goes on to rule India,” says Sharat Pradhan, senior journalist in the state capital, Lucknow. “Eight of India’s former prime ministers,” he adds, “have represented the state and in 2014, when Mr Modi - originally from the western state of Gujarat – made his debut as an MP, he too chose UP.” Mr Modi held his seat in the ancient city of Varanasi in 2019 and aims to do so again this year. So, Mr Modi has been on a whirlwind tour of the state, doing roadshows and addressing rallies – sometimes up to seven in a single day – to convince voters to support his party. He’s set his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a goal of 370 seats - a party needs 272 to win. In 2014, BJP won 71 seats in the state and in 2019, it got 62. This time, party leaders say, they’re aiming for 70 plus – even all of its 80 seats. The maths, the opposition Congress party’s Gaurav Kapoor says, is simple – “a party that wins 70 seats here needs just 202 more to form a government”. Earlier this month, when Mr Modi arrived in the city to file his nomination, accompanied by the state’s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a saffron-robed Hindu monk-turned-politician, thousands of supporters gathered to cheer them on. A truck painted saffron – the colour associated with the BJP – and decorated with marigold flowers carried them as their cavalcade made its way through the narrow streets of the ancient city. Mr Modi waved and held up a replica of the lotus flower – his party symbol – as men and women dressed in saffron clothes and caps raised slogans in support. It’s not just the BJP that’s eyeing the state regarded as “the biggest prize” in Indian election. The Congress, which was dominant in the state for four decades until it was edged out by local parties in 1991, is fighting here in alliance with the regional Samajwadi Party (SP). The alliance has also claimed that “we are winning 79 seats and have a fight in one”. Counting of votes on 4 June is likely to show claims on both sides are exaggerated, but analysts point out that all the elections in the past 10 years in the state have gone in the BJP’s favour. And the upbeat mood at Mr Modi’s roadshow reflected that self-assurance. Most Varanasi residents in the crowd talked about the transformation their city has undergone in the past decade – the new highways that have been built, the expansion of the Kashi-Vishwanath temple and the spruced-up banks of the river Ganges. Watching Mr Modi’s procession from his shop along the route of the roadshow, Ambrish Mittal, a chemist, says “the city roads are cleaner and the long power cuts that plunged the city into darkness for hours are history”. But despite its political significance, UP remains among India's poorest states - though there have been some positive changes in the past few years. Government data shows that millions more now have electricity, access to toilets and are using clean fuel compared to five years ago. But UP still has the largest concentration of poor in the world – with 23% of its population recorded as multidimensionally poor even after tens of millions have been lifted out of poverty. The state also records tens of thousands of violent crimes against women every year and continues to make headlines for cases where the accused are politically influential men. And although these ills have plagued the state historically, opposition parties have seized upon them and been raising them at their campaign rallies as the BJP has been in power nationally for a decade and also ruled UP for seven years now. The huge turnout at their meetings, opposition leaders say, reflects voter disenchantment with the BJP. “Until a few weeks back, election in the state had seemed like a one-sided contest with the odds stacked against us,” says Abhishek Yadav, a Samajwadi Party youth wing leader and a star campaigner for his party. But he feels that the opposition's campaign has gathered pace as unemployment and price rise have become main issues. The BJP claims that a lot of investment now started coming into the state and there’s been an industrial revival, but Gaurav Kapoor of the Congress says the government’s failure to establish any new industry or create jobs has alienated many voters. “Temples are the new industry for Mr Modi. Post-Covid, the only business that has progressed in the state are hotels and restaurants and other things to do with religious tourism. But the youth want jobs.” Ashwani Shahi of the BJP, however, blames opposition parties for everything that’s wrong with the state. “In 2017 when the BJP won UP, we inherited a state which was poor, had high rates of illiteracy and unemployment. We have started work to change that. “But It takes time to uplift people from poverty. I think By 2029, we’ll be able to take 90% people out of poverty.” Mr Shahi admits there is some anti-incumbency, but the BJP will still romp home in Uttar Pradesh – and the rest of India - because of Mr Modi.

bbc,Tackling water shortages with 'Star Wars' tech,28 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11nnwp646o,"When a severe drought hit the Indian city of Kozhikode, also known as Calicut, in 2016, residents including student Swapnil Shrivastav had access to a limited amount of water each day. “We were rationed to two buckets of water a day, which we collected from water tanks,” he says. While he says it’s not uncommon for water supply issues to impact parts of India, it was a tough month for Mr Shrivastav and others in the region. “It was a very humid area; it was unmanageable.” Mr Shrivastav was already interested in water scarcity having won a student competition in 2012 on imagining the future of water in cities, but the experience pushed him to explore solutions. “One element of inspiration was from Star Wars where there’s an air to water device. I thought why don’t we give it a try? It was more of a curiosity project.” Several years later, in 2019, that idea led him, Govinda Balaji and Venkatesh Raja to set up Uravu Labs, a Bangalore-based startup. Their system converts air to water using atmospheric water generators that contain a liquid desiccant, which absorbs moisture from the air. Using sunlight or renewable electricity they heat the desiccant to 65C which releases the moisture, which can then be condensed into drinking water. Mr Shrivastav says the whole process takes about 12 hours. Today each unit produces about 2,000 litres of drinking water. However, while his vision was to supply drinking water to communities facing water shortages, he says it wasn’t financially viable. “We realised the tech still needs more time to scale up and come down in cost,” says Mr Shrivastav. “Or someone should fund it, but we haven’t found the support in India.” Instead, they currently sell the water to 40 clients in the hospitality industry, who in turn use it to provide drinking water for customers. “We tried non-profit and CSR departments [corporate social responsibility]... but many companies shy away from tech. They thought it wouldn’t work. We had to shift to commercial consumption applications as they were ready to pay us and it’s a sustainability driver for them.” Water shortages are not new, but many countries, especially in the global south, are experiencing climate change-related intense drought and flooding that contaminates water sources. More than 50% of the global population – four billion people - experience water shortfalls at least once a month, while by 2025, 1.8 billion people are expected to be living in countries or regions with “absolute” water scarcity, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Could atmospheric water generation technology be the answer? Energy efficient – it can be powered by renewable sources – it’s one way of providing a fresh source of water without the need for traditional water infrastructure, making it an attractive option in remote locations. There appears to be a market for the technology. Valued at $3.4bn (£2.7bn) in 2022, the atmospheric water generation market is expected to be worth $13.5bn in 2032, according to a report by Global Market Insights. There are two main methods for atmospheric water generation. Firstly, there’s the cooling and condensation process which cools humid air to its dew point, causing water vapour to condense into liquid water. The second is a desiccant-based system which uses hygroscopic materials to absorb moisture from the air, then release it through a heating process, he says. Through her social enterprise Majik Water, co-founder and chief executive Beth Koigi manages about 40 atmospheric water generator units across arid and semi-arid regions across Kenya, using a cooling and condensation-based techniques to capture moisture from the air. Founded in 2017, Ms Koigi was inspired to start Majik Water after experiencing water scarcity for the first time during a drought when she was studying in Nairobi in 2016. While many visited a nearby river to fetch water for cooking, drinking and washing, Koigi says she couldn’t bring herself to drink the contaminated water. “It made me realise that you take for granted water as it’s always there.” She started looking for other water source ideas and set up a water filter company before developing an air-to-water system. Majik Water works with NGOs and humanitarian organisations, as well as being sold in stores. Majik's biggest unit produces 500 litres of water in 24 hours and is installed in schools and small communities. While there is demand for her company's system, Ms Koigi does not see it as a permanent solution. “Honestly, I feel like this is not the solution to water scarcity,” says Ms Koigi. “It’s a temporary solution… mostly because it’s not cheap."" Manufacturers are focused on making air-to-water generation systems more energy efficient, says Avinash Singh, associate director of research and consulting at Global Market Insights. “For instance, innovations in compressors, heat exchangers, and desiccants have improved the energy efficiency of such systems."" He adds that government support, subsidies, or environmental regulations could drive further adoption of the technology. One development which has helped the adoption of such water systems is the move to digital payments. Headquartered in Italy, Veragon has water production units across the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and South America. “When we originally started with off-grid communities, it was a cash-based society which wasn’t really viable… nowadays it’s being digitalised,” says Veragon global business director Stephen White. “For example, the majority of Cambodia is covered by 4G and Covid saw an explosion of e-wallets. There’s much better private infrastructure and partnership -  the government doesn’t have to be involved, and we sell water at much lower price.” He says all units will be moved to digital in the next few months. However, the prices of the units is not cheap. Veragon says its units, which use the cooling and condensing system, cost between $60,000 and $70,000. But Mr Shrivastav points that making water in situ has a cost advantage as water is quite heavy and not easy to transport around. Looking ahead, Uravu Labs is exploring how advancements in material science can improve the efficiency of desiccants, or how utilising a different material for absorbing more moisture from the air could make the process more effective. Mr Shrivastav says these advancements will also result in reducing the heat required from 60C to 40C. They are also hoping to run pilot projects involving installing its units in data centres in India and Singapore. Data centres generate a lot of heat which is usually lost, but Uravu plans to instead to use it create fresh water. “This process will result in up to 95% reduction in fresh water consumption [by the datacentre] as Uravu's system captures most of the waste heat and gives back cold water, thus very little freshwater is needed as a top-up,” says Mr Shrivastav.

bbc,At least 16 dead as cyclone hits Bangladesh and India,27 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvv8q10vxvo,"At least 16 people have died after a cyclone crashed into coastal parts of India and southern Bangladesh. The region was hit by strong gales of 110km/h, torrential rain and tidal surges that have left low-lying areas flooded. Nearly a million people were evacuated as Cyclone Remal made landfall on Sunday evening. According to local authorities, approximately 8.4 million people lived in the cyclone's path, including 3.6 million children. The storm passed through the Bangladeshi port of Mongla and the Sagar Islands of West Bengal, India, on Sunday, weakening the following day. Bangladesh's minister for disaster Mohibbur Rahman told AFP news agency at least 10 people were killed in the cyclone. Some died from drowning and some from being crushed beneath their collapsed houses. ""A total of 3.75 million people have been affected... 35,483 homes were destroyed by the cyclone, and another 115,992 homes were damaged,"" Mr Rahman said. In neighbouring India, Sumit Gupta, a senior official in the West Bengal state government, confirmed the deaths of at least six civilians, including three who had been electrocuted. The cyclone destroyed thousands of homes, uprooted trees and damaged power lines. Strong winds blew the roofs off some tin and thatched houses, while mud huts were flattened. Ahead of Cyclone Remal, nearly three million people in Bangladesh saw their electricity shut off to avoid accidents, ministry officials said. Authorities in West Bengal quoted by Reuters news agency said at least 1,200 power poles had been uprooted. ""We have had no electricity since night, my mobile battery will run out any time,"" Rahat Raja from Bangladesh's coastal district of Satkhira told Reuters. A villager from Bagerhat in the country's south told the BBC the cyclone had created food shortages. ""There are no vehicles available on the road. There are shortages of food also. All shops are closed since yesterday,” Mohammed Ali said. Among the country's affected areas is Cox's Bazar in the southeast, where camps housing the nearly a million Rohingya refugees are at risk from landslides and flooding due to their flimsy temporary shelters. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) in the Asia Pacific region said they warned people in the camps, and had trained volunteers on standby, ready to relocate people living in ""high-risk areas"". Save the Children said it had sent four emergency response teams to the country's affected areas, including a medical team, to support recovery. The charity's country director Shumon Sengupta said the cyclone ""shows yet again how vulnerable Bangladesh is to extreme weather events"". Bangladesh is one of the world's most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change, suffering extremes from heatwaves to flooding. Cyclone Remal has been moving across the Bay of Bengal over the past few days, allowing authorities in both countries to prepare for its arrival. In Kolkata, the capital of India's West Bengal state, more than 50 flights were cancelled on Sunday. Flights have since resumed. In May 2023, the Bay of Bengal was hit by the region's most powerful cyclone in more than a decade, affecting thousands in Bangladesh and Myanmar. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,"Delhi hospital where babies died lacked licence, fire exits",27 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp33vmn3d8eo,"A hospital in Indian capital Delhi where seven babies died in a fire was operating without a valid licence, police said. The fire occurred on Saturday, leading to the arrests of the hospital owner and the doctor on duty. An investigation has found that the hospital also did not have fire extinguishers or an emergency exit. The tragedy took place hours after a fire broke out in a gaming arcade in Gujarat state's Rajkot city, killing 27 people.  Fires often break out in residential and commercial buildings in India due to a lax enforcement of safety norms. Saturday's tragedy, where a blaze engulfed the hospital in Delhi's Vivek Vihar neighbourhood, has horrified and angered people. Police commissioner Shahdara Surendra Chaudhary told ANI news agency that the hospital's NOC (No Objection Certificate) had expired on 31 March. A fire NOC - which certifies that a building meets fire safety standards - is required for hospital buildings that have a height of more than 15m (49ft). Mr. Chaudhary added that the hospital was permitted only five beds but had installed 10. At the time of the fire, 12 newborn babies were at the hospital. Five of them are now being treated at another hospital. Police have arrested Dr Naveen Kichi, director of the hospital and a doctor named Akash (the police shared only one name) in connection with the fire. They have been charged with culpable homicide. Dr Akash, who was on duty at the time of the incident, was not qualified to treat newborn babies in need of intensive care, police said. The Delhi government has ordered a magisterial inquiry. Dramatic visuals of fire engulfing the building on Saturday circulated on social media. The director of Delhi's fire department, Atul Garg, told the Press Trust of India news agency that the fire had spread due to a blast in an oxygen cylinder. Media reports say that the police is also investigating the possibility of the hospital running an illegal oxygen cylinder filling racket after locals reported suspicious activities. Officials also said rescue efforts were slowed by limited access to the building, which has a single staircase and no fire escape. Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the tragedy was ""heartbreaking"". ""The causes of the incident are being investigated and whoever is responsible for this negligence will not be spared,"" Mr Kejriwal said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi described it as ""heart-rending."" He has announced an ex gratia of 200,000 rupees ($2407; £1889) to the family members of each of the deceased and 50,000 rupees each to those injured. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,LGBTQ Indians are more accepted than ever - but politics hasn't caught up,27 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68933715,"Madhu Bai says she is like a rainbow. She rose from a storm, fleetingly spread joy and then returned to the sky. The 44-year-old made history in 2015 when she became the first trans person to be elected a mayor in India. She won in Raigarh, a small town in the central state of Chhattisgarh. But when her term ended in 2020, Madhu returned to her old life without a pension or government benefits. She dances and sings with other hijras, or trans women, at weddings and birth ceremonies - a common livelihood in India's transgender community. Madhu has no intention of re-joining politics. She says she is tired and thinks it's too polarised. ""I fought, won and worked for the people. Now I want to live for myself."" Madhu's short but successful political foray in India is a rarity in a field where the LGBTQ community is still heavily underrepresented. It's perplexing, activists say, in a democracy where acceptance of sexual and gender diversity has been on the rise and the community has seen many wins. In 2014, the Supreme Court officially recognised transgender people and their rights to welfare and other government benefits. Four years later, it scrapped a colonial-era ban on gay sex. Over half of Indian adults now believe same-sex marriage should be legal, according to a Pew survey. But LGBTQ Indians cannot only rely on the courts for change, as a ruling from the top court to not legalise same-sex unions demonstrated last year. Judges declared that changing the law was a matter for politicians, not the justice system. Campaigners say that LGBTQ politicians are the best advocates for their community. Yet in this year's general election, no major political party has fielded a single openly LGBTQ candidate. ""Queer people have been left out of conversations, told politics is not an avenue for them for so long,"" says Anish Gawande, a writer and founder of Pink List India, the country's first archive of politicians supporting LGBTQ+ rights. ""They never got the chance to build the necessary structures to advocate their demands."" No-one knows this better than Madhu. She says overcoming the ridicule and contempt of her opponents was more challenging than wooing voters, who connected with her instantly. After going door-to-door with her friends for days, asking for money to fund the campaign, she struggled to get a party ticket. Indian elections are expensive, and contesting independently without political funding is costlier. But she had no option after the two main political parties rejected her. When she won, she thought leaders would take her seriously. They didn't. At her first meeting, she says, members of several parties walked out. She alleges that a local leader threatened to slap her because he found her dance videos offensive. There were also days, in the beginning, when Madhu said she felt unsure whether she could use the women's washroom around party workers. ""People loved me and my work, but rivals hated my guts,"" she says. ""Behind the ridicule and abuse, I know they were all thinking the same thing: 'How could a hijra be the mayor?'"" The only official data on India's LGBTQ population is the government estimate: 2.5 million. But survey estimates suggest the true figure could be over 135 million. Campaigners say things have changed since Madhu won her seat. Today, more Indians know someone who is LGBTQ than they did a few years ago. Even some politicians, who were once wary of the subject, are becoming allies and promising more rights. ""Political parties in India are slowly peeping out of the closet and talking more prominently about LGBTQ rights,"" says Harish Iyer, one of India's first openly gay persons to be involved with a political party. There's also a growing momentum among the youth, who, Mr Iyer says, want to ""do away with homophobia once and for all"". This year's election campaign comes months after the Supreme Court decided to not legalise same-sex unions. Three opposition parties have promised to recognise same-sex couples legally, but the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - which polls suggest is likely to win a historic third term - has not. Despite this, Mr Gawande insists that LGBTQ rights are a current that Indian politics can no longer dismiss. The community's social and cultural capital is ""far in excess of its numerical strength"", he says. He expects the near future to bring wins on recognising relationships, affirmative action for trans people and access to healthcare. Some of these fights might not grab headlines - especially those affecting poorer people, who are at the sharp end of exclusion from jobs, education and political opportunities. ""LGBTQ struggles need to be seen through the lens of caste privilege,"" says Grace Banu, a Dalit (formerly untouchable) trans woman activist from the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Born in a poor family, she says she first faced discrimination because of her caste, and then over her gender. When she came out at the age of 14, her school barred her from taking classes and made her sit under a tree as punishment. When she resisted, her parents put her in a psychiatric hospital to ""cure her illness"". ""I would tell myself that this cannot be my destiny,"" she says. ""One day, I ran away to make my own fate."" Today, Ms Banu is a software engineer, the first trans woman with an engineering degree in her state, and considers herself a mother to 12 trans women. She lives in Chennai with a clan of three trans women, all of whom are also involved in the anti-caste and trans rights movement. Sprawled in the living room, they talk passionately about their lives, the conversations swerving across topics. One moment they are discussing their next court battle and the next minute they are wondering what to eat for lunch. ""The transgender, or the LGBTQ identity, is not a monolith,"" says Ms Banu, while her friends busy themselves in the kitchen, the clatter of plates occasionally interrupting the afternoon stillness. The 44-year-old recently petitioned an Indian court seeking ""horizontal reservations"", or separate quotas for transgender people in government jobs, within the existing quotas for historically disadvantaged communities. Ms Banu stresses that being transgender varies vastly across caste and class lines. Her fight, she says, focuses on the most marginalised. At the other end of Chennai, in an upscale apartment along the sea, lives Apsara Reddy, a trans woman and spokesperson of AIADMK, one of Tamil Nadu's main political parties. A former journalist with degrees from Australia and the UK, Ms Reddy's is a life of luxury: she drives a shiny silver Jaguar, collects art and wears the finest of silk saris. Ms Reddy acknowledges her privilege, but says: ""In politics, you need to look at the larger picture. You can't just be the voice of your own community."" Ms Reddy hasn't contested in an election but if she does, she doesn't want to be typecast ""as an LGBTQ flagbearer"" of her party. ""If you want to judge me, do it on the basis of my potential as a policy-maker, not my gender identity."" Activists say few in the LGBTQ community are able to come out like Ms Reddy, let alone conceive a life in politics. Mr Gawande suggests that for a long time, the community was never a political priority. The battle for equality taking place in the courts made it difficult for them to build relationships with other marginalised communities under a broader fight for equality, he says. Now he wants the community to focus on grassroots political activism, which he believes will raise the profile of LGBTQ issues. Mr Iyer, however, believes the ball is now in the court of the country's leaders. ""We are your friends, your family, customers, beneficiaries; we are everywhere but you haven't looked for us. If you call us, we will come to you, and that's what we expect from political parties."" Back in Raigarh, Madhu says it gets hard to get by sometimes, without a fixed pay. But given the life she's had, she's not constrained by what may lie ahead. ""Whatever it is, it's definitely not politics,"" she says, her jaunty sing-song voice soaring into a laugh. But she hopes others from the community seek political opportunities, so that queer people are no longer seen as oddities. ""Who knows, maybe then the country will see a rainbow again.""

bbc,Newborn babies die after fire at Delhi hospital,26 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c722zv2r64do,"At least six newborn babies have died following a fire at a hospital in Delhi, according to police. The blaze broke out late on Saturday evening at a hospital in the Indian capital's Vivek Vihar region. There were 12 babies in the unit, senior police officer Surendra Choudhary said. Another had died before the fire began. Authorities said legal action would be taken against the owner of the hospital, who had fled. Dramatic pictures on social media show several bursts of fire engulfing the building. Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the fire was ""heartbreaking"". ""The causes of the incident are being investigated and whoever is responsible for this negligence will not be spared,"" Mr Kejriwal said. The director of Delhi's fire department, Atul Garg, told the Press Trust of India news agency that 14 fire trucks had been sent to fight the blaze. ""The fire spread too fast due to a blast in an oxygen cylinder,"" he said. Officials said rescue efforts were slowed by limited access to the building, which has a single staircase and no fire escape. The hospital is squeezed between residential houses. It is not clear yet whether it followed all safety regulations, nor what initially caused the fire. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on X: ""The fire tragedy at a hospital in Delhi is heart-rending."" Earlier on Saturday, a ""massive fire"" broke out at a games arcade in Rajkot, in the western state of Gujarat. At least 27 people perished in that blaze, local officials said. Many of the victims are believed to be children. Families of the deceased are awaiting the results of DNA testing before the bodies can be handed over. Investigators are probing whether sparks from a welding machine ignited the blaze, according to local media. CCTV footage reportedly showed a welding machine being operated above piles of flammable material, according to The Indian Express newspaper, which cited a government official. A short circuit was previously believed to have been responsible for the blaze. Within a matter of hours following the fire breaking out, the two-storey building had been destroyed. When the BBC’s team reached the location, all that was visible was scrap metal and burnt debris. Authorities continued searching for further bodies in the rubble on Sunday. Fires are not uncommon in Indian cities as building bylaws are often flouted, residential and commercial areas not clearly segregated and enforcement of safety regulations can be lax. In 2019, a large fire swept through a bag factory in the capital, killing 43 workers. Additional reporting by Roxy Gagdekar Chhara, BBC Gujarati Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Fighting for votes in 'the world's biggest data mine',26 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggqx4lwp6o,"They are the apps every Indian has on their phone - the one where you order your taxi, your food, find your next date. Innocuous, everyday, unremarkable to billions around the world. In India, these are also potentially the apps telling politicians everything they could possibly want to know about you - whether you want them to or not. A person's religion, mother tongue, ""the way you draft a message to your friend on social media"" have all become points of data politicians are keen to get their hands on, according to political strategist Rutwik Joshi, who is working with at least a dozen unnamed lawmakers on their re-election campaigns this election. And India’s combination of high smartphone take-up and lax regulations allowing private companies to sell data mean that most political parties have gathered ""the data to do everything"" - even down to knowing “what you are eating today"", he claims. The question is, why do they care? Put simply, says Mr Joshi, this level of information can predict the vote - ""and these predictions usually never go wrong"". But perhaps the bigger question is: why should you care? Microtargeting - described by Privacy International as the use of personal data “to target you with information and adverts to an unprecedented degree of personalisation” - is not new when it comes to elections. But it was in the wake of former US President Donald Trump’s 2016 win that it really hit the headlines. Back then, political consultancy Cambridge Analytica was credited with helping him to victory using data sold by Facebook to profile people and send them pro-Trump content. The firm denied these allegations but suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix. In 2022, Meta agreed to pay $725m (£600m) to settle a class action lawsuit over a data breach linked to Cambridge Analytica. It left people questioning whether the adverts they had seen had swayed their votes. Countries around the world were concerned enough about the impact on democracy that they swung into action. In India, a Cambridge Analytica affiliate said the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the opposition Congress party were its clients - which both denied. The country's then IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also warned of action against the company and Facebook if it misused data of Indian citizens. But there has since been little to stop micro-targeting of voters, data and security researcher Srinivas Kodali says. ""Every other election commission - like in the UK and Singapore - they all tried to understand the role of data and micro targeting in elections, they created certain forms of checks and balances, which is what normally an election commission should be doing, but we are not seeing that happen in India,"" he says. In India, the problem is compounded because it's ""a data society that was planned and built by the government without any safeguards"", Mr Kodali says. Indeed, there are some 650m smartphones users in the country - all boasting apps which could potentially share their data with a third party. But you don't necessarily need a smartphone to be vulnerable: one of the biggest holders of personal data is the government itself – and even it has been selling personal information to private companies. “The government built large databases of citizens, shared it with the private sector,” Mr Kodali says. This has all left citizens vulnerable to increased surveillance with little control over what information remains private, warns Prateek Waghre, executive director at the digital rights organisation Internet Freedom Foundation. Meanwhile, a data protection law passed by the government last year is yet to be implemented, experts say. The lack of rules is an issue, says Mr Kodali. ""It's like the wild, wild west - except on the internet."" And the result of all of this available data? As Mr Joshi puts it, India entered the election year as ""the biggest possible data mine in the world right now"". The thing is, no one is doing anything illegal, says Mr Joshi. "" I am not asking [the app], 'Give me mobile numbers of how many users you have and all the contact numbers of those users as well'. But I can ask, 'Are people eating veg or non-veg in your area?'"" he explains. And the apps are able to hand over that data – because the user gave them permission. ""For example, there are 10 different Indian apps in your mobile phone - you have given access to your contacts, to your gallery, to your mic, to your speakers, to your location, including the live location,"" Mr Joshi, whose company, Neeti I, has been using data to understand voter behaviour patterns in particular constituencies, says. And it is this data – along with data collected by party workers - which is then used to help decide who the candidate should be, where the candidate's wife should go to do a puja or aarti (offer prayers), what kind of speeches they should give - even what to wear. But does this level of targeting really work to change people’s mind? That remains unclear. But campaigners say on a basic level, it is a violation of people’s privacy. Extrapolating it further, having this level of detail could be used against people in the future. ""Just the fact that it is happening is problematic."" says Pratik Waghre, executive director at the digital rights organisation Internet Freedom Foundation. ""What we've seen is that there often doesn't seem to be a clear distinction between how data is being handled when someone is beneficiary of a government scheme and how that information is then being used by that particular political party which happens to be in power in a particular state or at a national level to then use that to micro target people with campaign messages."" The law also allows the government and government bodies to exempt themselves from vast sections on its discretion. It also has the powers to process, use or share this personal data with third parties. Mr Waghre fears future administrations could take it a step further. ""It can also be: ‘Let's collectively see who's supporting us and only give them the benefits’.” The use of such data also comes against the backdrop of India's larger misinformation problem, Mr Kodali says. And when combined with the amount of data on offer, it is a real problem. ""When you talk about artificial intelligence, targeted advertisements, micro targeting of voters - a lot of this falls under the idea of computational propaganda,"" he explains. ""Questions of this were raised heavily during the 2016 Trump election, where this election is considered as something that was influenced by foreign actors."" Mr Kodali says use of data and technology in election campaigns must be regulated just like money and ad spending currently is in order to keep elections fair. “If you have one or few set of political parties or groups with access to these technologies gaming elections, they may be free but they will stop looking fair,” he warns.

bbc,An Indian tale of love and sisterhood unfolds at Cannes,25 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl55dpd4d24o,"Indian filmmaker Payal Kapadia’s new film opens with street scenes of contemporary Mumbai. But All We Imagine as Light does not show us the rich, elite Mumbai of Bollywood stars and billionaire industrialists. Instead the filmmaker overlays the street images with voices of real immigrants of Mumbai who are the city’s heartbeat. This is Kapadia’s first narrative feature and it premiered on Thursday night in the main competition section of the Cannes Film Festival. The film received an eight-minute-long standing ovation. It's a significant achievement for the filmmaker, and also for India. This is the first time in 30 years that an Indian film has played in Cannes’ main competition section. Kapadia, 38, shares the limelight and the possibility of winning one of the festival’s prestigious awards with the likes of Francis Ford Coppola, Yorgos Lanthimos, Ali Abbasi, Jacques Audiard, and Jia Zhangke. Over the last four decades, Indian films have done fairly well on the world festival circuit. Mira Nair’s Salaam Bombay won the Camera d’Or at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival. A few days before the September 11 terrorist attacks, Nair’s 2001 classic Monsoon Wedding won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Director Ritesh Batra’s 2013 celebrated film The Lunchbox won the Grand Golden Rail Award at Cannes. And earlier this year director Shuchi Talati’s Girls Will Be Girls was awarded the Grand Jury and Audience prizes at the Sundance Film Festival. But the possibility of Palm d’Or or one of the other key Cannes awards has so far eluded India – the biggest film producing country in the world. This year, thanks to Kapadia’s beautifully realised and moving film, India stands a good chance of winning. Already the reviews have been full of high praise. The Guardian in its five-star review describes it as ""glorious… an absorbing story full of humanity"". The critic puts the film on a par with Satyajit Ray’s Mahanagar (The Big City) and Aranyer Din Ratri (Days and Nights in the Forest). And IndieWire in its A-grade review says Kapadia’s drama gives Mumbai a romantic gaze, as reflected in the way ""people occupy their space… whether alone or sharing"". Daughter of a well-known Indian artist Nalini Malani, Kapadia is very familiar with Mumbai, a multicultural and diverse city. ""It’s also a place where it’s a little bit easier for women to work as compared to many other places in the country,"" Kapadia says. ""I wanted to make a film about women who leave their homes to go to work somewhere else."" In All We Know as Light, Kapadia tracks the lives and struggles of two Indian nurses from the southern state of Kerala working in a hospital and living together in a small, congested apartment in Mumbai. One nurse – Prabha (Kani Kusruti, who played a supporting role in Girls Will Be Girls) - is married. Her husband now works in Germany and barely ever communicates with her. But then she suddenly receives a surprise gift from her husband – a rice cooker. She hugs the machine, as if it is the last sign of love in her marriage. The second nurse, Anu (Divya Prabha), is more adventurous and is carrying a secret romance with a young Muslim man Shiaz (a charming young actor, Hridhu Haroon) who is also from Kerala. Anu is Hindu and her family would not approve of her relationship with Shiaz. Mumbai’s congested environment with 22 million people clamouring for space and its harsh monsoon season does not allow Anu and Shiaz any privacy. But then suddenly a third nurse from their hospital – Parvaty (Chhaya Kadam, appearing in two films at Cannes this year) - decides to leave the city, forced out by the redevelopment of a slum for the city's rich. Could this be the chance to change the course of these characters' lives? The politics of negotiating space is no different than the struggles of students Kapadia captured in her last film – a documentary titled A Night of Knowing Nothing. The film premiered in the Directors’ Fortnight sidebar section of the Cannes festival in 2022. It won the L'Œil d'or ""Golden Eye"", the festival’s top documentary award. A Night of Knowing Nothing followed the 2015 students’ strike at the country’s prestigious government-run Film and Television Institute of India. Kapadia was part of the strike, and finally graduated from the institute with a degree in direction in 2018. In an interview in 2022 she described the documentary as a ""love letter to public universities and what they stand for – a place where ideally people of all strata of society can be together and enjoy freedom, both intellectual and physical"".

On Thursday, temperatures soared beyond 45C in many states and touched 48.8C in Rajasthan state's Barmer city. India's weather department has said that the heatwave is likely to continue till Wednesday. Several regions are facing water and electricity shortages due to spikes in power consumption.

Delhi is experiencing a brutal heat spell, with temperatures hovering around 45-46C through this week. Weather experts say that the heat index - or the apparent or experienced temperature - has crossed 50C because of the high levels of humidity. Hospitals in the city have set up special facilities to treat patients experiencing heat-related illnesses, which are also on the rise.

bbc,Google to make Pixel phones and drones in India,24 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq55z7ynjyro,"Tech giant Google will soon begin making its Pixel smartphones in India, sources aware of the development have told the BBC. Google is set to manufacture the phones at an existing Foxconn facility in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The firm is also set to independently manufacture drones in the state. India has emerged as a key destination for global firms looking to diversify supply lines outside China in the midst of geopolitical tensions with the West. Last year, Google had announced plans to make Pixel smartphones in India, beginning with the Pixel 8. ""India is a priority market for Pixel smartphones, and we’re committed to bringing the best of our hardware and underlying built-in software capabilities to people across the country,"" it said in a blog post. On Friday, sources told the BBC that Alphabet's Google would make advanced versions of Pixel smartphones at the Tamil Nadu facility and that manufacturing would begin within this calendar year. Google and Foxconn have signed a contract to this end, the source said. Foxconn currently has two facilities in Tamil Nadu. At one of its facilities near Chennai city, it assembles Apple's iPhones. Google's decision to make Pixel phones in Tamil Nadu came after state officials met company executives recently. According to a statement from the Tamil Nadu government, officials from Google are also set to meet state Chief Minister MK Stalin in Chennai soon. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Czech court okays extradition of US murder plot accused,23 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c06682y50veo,"The Czech Constitutional Court has rejected an Indian man's petition against his extradition to the US over an alleged plot to assassinate an American citizen in New York. Nikhil Gupta has been charged by the US government with trying to hire a hitman to assassinate US-based Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. Mr Gupta is in jail in Prague. A final decision on his extradition will be taken by the country's justice minister. The charges against Mr Gupta carry up to 20 years in prison. In November 2023, US prosecutors charged Mr Gupta with a plot to kill at least four Sikh separatists in North America, including Mr Pannun. They said that Mr Gupta had paid $100,000 (£79,000) in cash to a hitman to assassinate Mr Pannun, a dual US-Canadian citizen, in New York. But the hitman was actually an undercover federal agent, prosecutors said. Mr Gupta was allegedly directed by an Indian government official who was not named or charged in the indictment. India has designated Mr Pannun a terrorist, an allegation he denies, claiming to be an activist who believes in the movement for Khalistan, or a separate Sikh homeland. The White House said it raised the alleged assassination plot with India at the most senior level. India officials distanced themselves from the plot, saying such actions were against government policy. It also said it had formed a committee to investigate the allegations against Mr Gupta. In January, India's Supreme Court rejected a plea from Mr Gupta which asked it to aid his release and help him get a fair trial. The petition in India had claimed that Mr Gupta was arrested by ""self-claimed"" US federal agents and has not yet been given a fair trial. India's top court said it would not intervene in the case, adding that it was up to the government to take action. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,These elephants are dying on rail tracks - can AI save them?,21 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68988189,"The southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu is using an AI-based surveillance system to prevent elephant deaths on its railway tracks. Elephant deaths on and near the state's railway tracks are rising, with 36 fatalities recorded from train collisions in the past decade, according to official data. Eleven of these fatalities occurred on two railway tracks near Madukkarai, where the forest borders the state of Kerala. These tracks intersect with the elephants' migratory route to neighbouring forests. In 2021, the state's high court ordered the forest department and railways to prevent elephant deaths on these tracks. The forest department has now installed 12 towers along two of Madukkarai's rail tracks, each equipped with an AI camera capable of thermal and visible light imaging, along with live viewing. Project manager Ashish Rajput said that the AI system's cameras, comparable to those used by the Indian Army along the nation's borders, are programmed to even detect humans near railway lines. When elephants are detected within 100ft of the railway track, alerts are sent to forest and railway officials, who coordinate to slow down trains and guide the elephants away to prevent collisions. Four personnel continuously monitor the system in the control room near the railway track. The project, launched in February, has been executed at a cost of 72.4m rupees ($867,758; £683,976), says Supriya Sahu, secretary of the Tamil Nadu Forest Department. Previously, forest personnel conducted regular patrols along railway tracks to monitor elephant activity. Ms Sahu said this method had limitations, and ensuring complete elephant safety from accidents posed ""significant challenges"". Within months of its implementation, the AI system has detected nearly 400 instances of elephants approaching railway tracks and promptly reported to railway authorities, thus preventing potential accidents, she said. ""Alerts are sent if any animal, not just elephants, is found nearing the track,"" say Mr Manikandan, who works at the control room. This is not the first time AI is being used to protect wildlife in India. In December, India's federal railway ministry said it was implementing an AI-based surveillance system - called Gajraj - in elephant corridors across several states in the country. Under this project, officials are installing sensors using AI tech near railway tracks which send notifications to alert the railway administration and the forest department about the movement of the elephants, other animals, and humans to prevent accidents. In African countries like Gabon, Kenya and Botswana, AI camera systems are being used for elephant conservation efforts. Tamil Nadu has announced plans for its expansion of the new system to five other vulnerable areas in the state, including Coimbatore, Dharmapuri, Hosur, and Gudalur. ""Technological interventions significantly reduce train-related accidents involving wildlife,"" Ms Sahu said. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc,Delhi sizzles as temperatures cross 45C,20 May 2024,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c888e0730zpo,"Northern India, including capital Delhi, is reeling under a fierce heatwave with temperatures soaring above 45C over the weekend. On Sunday, Najafgarh district in Delhi recorded a temperature of 47.8C, the highest in the country this season. The weather department has said the heat spell is likely to continue this week. The searing heat comes as India is holding its general election, the results of which will be declared on 4 June. Indian summers, which extend from March to September, are usually hot and humid. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has said the country is likely to experience longer and more intense heatwaves this year. On Saturday, temperatures crossed 45C in 10 locations in the National Capital Region (NCR), which encompasses Delhi and some districts from the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan. The IMD has predicted that maximum temperatures in Delhi and other northern cities are likely to hover around 45-46C over Monday and Tuesday. It has also predicted a fresh heat spell over parts of western and central India over the next few days. Many Indian states, reeling under the heatwave, are also going to the polls this week. On Monday, millions of voters will cast their votes in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar while Delhi will vote on 25 May. The elections are being held in seven phases from 19 April to 1 June. Many voters have expressed discomfort stepping out in the extreme heat. They say it's difficult standing in queues, especially for senior citizens. India's election authorities have extended voting timings and have asked people to protect themselves against the heat while going to vote. Summers have always been gruelling in many parts of India - especially in the northern and central regions.  While some people use air-conditioners and water coolers to keep themselves cool, others, especially in the more distant towns, have devised their own ways of coping with the heat - from keeping water cool in earthen jugs to taking drinks made with raw mango pulp to ward off heat strokes.
