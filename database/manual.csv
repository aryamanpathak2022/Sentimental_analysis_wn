"An Indian man pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of orchestrating a failed assassination plot against a Sikh separatist in New York, a plan that prosecutors say he devised on behalf of an unnamed official in India’s government. The defendant, Nikhil Gupta, 52, was arrested in the Czech Republic a year ago, and was extradited last week to make his first appearance in Manhattan federal court. He is accused of trying to arrange the murder of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American citizen and lawyer for a New York-based Sikh secessionist group. The murder attempt, which played out against a backdrop of doubt about India’s commitment to democracy, spanned several countries and mirrored the successful killing of another separatist in Canada, prosecutors say. On Monday morning, Mr. Gupta entered the Lower Manhattan courtroom in a blue cardigan and yellow patterned shirt and appeared relaxed as he spoke to his lawyer, Jeffrey Chabrowe, at the defense table. He has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since landing in the United States on Friday afternoon. In a statement to reporters after the arraignment, Mr. Chabrowe called the case a “complex matter"" for India and the United States. “Background and details will develop that may cast government allegations into an entirely new light,” he said. Mr. Gupta is charged with murder for hire and conspiracy to commit murder for hire. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison for each charge. He was sent back to the detention center after Monday’s arraignment and is set to appear in court again on June 28. In a statement Monday, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said Mr. Gupta will “now face justice” in an American courtroom. “This extradition makes clear that the Justice Department will not tolerate attempts to silence or harm American citizens,” he said. In an indictment unsealed in November, Manhattan federal prosecutors described an audacious plot that began around May 2023 when an Indian government employee enlisted Mr. Gupta to organize the killing of Mr. Pannun, who was living in New York at the time. Mr. Pannun is the general counsel of Sikhs for Justice, an organization that supports the secession of Punjab, a state in northern India. He is a vocal critic of the Indian government and has been banned from the country, prosecutors say. Mr. Gupta, who lived in India, had told the government official about “his involvement in international narcotics and weapons trafficking,” according to the indictment. At the direction of the Indian government employee, Mr. Gupta contacted a man who he believed would help him hire a hit man in New York, but who was, in fact, an agent for the American government. That agent introduced Mr. Gupta to an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration officer who pretended to be the hit man. In deals brokered by Mr. Gupta, the Indian government official agreed to pay the D.E.A. officer $100,000 to kill Mr. Pannun, including a $15,000 cash advance for the job, prosecutors said. Mr. Gupta then shared personal information about Mr. Pannun with the undercover officer, including Mr. Pannun’s address in New York and his phone number. When the Indian official asked for updates, Mr. Gupta relayed surveillance photos of Mr. Pannun that the agent had sent him. Mr. Gupta instructed the undercover officer to carry out the assassination as soon as possible, but asked him not to do it around the time of high-level meetings between U.S. and Indian officials, according to the indictment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington and met with President Biden in June 2023. Then, prosecutors said, on June 18 of that year, gunmen killed Hardeep Singh Nijjar, another Sikh separatist leader, in British Columbia, Canada. Mr. Nijjar knew Mr. Pannun and was also an outspoken critic of the Indian government. Soon after, prosecutors said, Mr. Gupta told the undercover officer that Mr. Nijjar “was also the target” and that “we have so many targets.” Mr. Gupta then told the officer — the pretend hit man — that there was “now no need to wait” to kill Mr. Pannun, prosecutors said. On Monday, Mr. Pannun said in a statement that he had “full faith” that the United States would hold Mr. Gupta and his co-conspirators accountable. “The attempt on my life on American soil is the blatant case of India’s transnational terrorism challenging America’s sovereignty and unequivocally proves that Modi’s India believes in using violence to suppress the dissenting political opinion,” he said. A spokesman for the Indian Embassy in Washington, D.C., could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. Mr. Gupta’s case has threatened to complicate the delicate relations among Washington, Ottawa and New Delhi. During his presidency, Mr. Biden has courted India’s leaders to counter the influence of Russia and China, despite growing concerns about India’s commitment to democracy. Mr. Modi, who has been in office since 2014, was re-elected as India’s prime minister in June, even as his Bharatiya Janata Party lost its majority in Parliament.",negative
"A freight train collided with a passenger train in eastern India on Monday, killing at least eight people and injuring 50 others, officials said. The episode occurred at around 9 a.m. when the Kanchanjunga Express, which was carrying passengers to the state of West Bengal from the state of Tripura, was leaving the Rangapani station. Four coaches of the popular and often-crowded passenger train derailed when it was rammed from behind by the commercial train. Images from the accident site showed one of the passenger coaches lifted off the railway track and balancing on a coach of the freight train. The death toll was likely to rise. Local news outlets, citing police officials, reported at least 15 people dead. The driver and the assistant driver of the freight train and a guard on the passenger train were among those killed. Jaya Varma Sinha, the chairperson of India’s railway board, said rescue operations were completed. Ashwini Vaishnaw, India’s railway minister, was en route to the site. The relatively low number of casualties could be attributed to the fact that the rear portion of the Kanchanjunga Express, which took the biggest impact from the collision, comprised cargo coaches and the guard’s coach. Passengers were in compartments far forward from the impact. While an investigation has been ordered to look into the cause of the collision, Ms. Sinha said human error such as disregarding a railway signal could have caused the crash. The accident again brings to the fore the issue of rail safety in a country whose millions of poor residents rely on railways for transport. India’s rail network is one of the world’s largest and is crucial to the country’s economy and its people’s lives and livelihood. The country has, in recent years, invested heavily on rail safety after a long history of deadly accidents. Although the overall number of rail accidents has lessened over the past decade, incidents with mass casualties have persisted. Last June, 290 people were killed when two passenger trains collided after one of them struck a stationary freight train at full speed and derailed in the state of Odisha. After that incident, opposition leaders demanded the resignation of Mr. Vaishnaw, the railway minister. He has said he was trying to expand a safety system, called Kavach, that is meant to prevent accidents when two trains are moving on the same track. Ms. Sinha said the technology had not yet been deployed on the route of the Kanchanjunga Express.",negative
"After a weekslong election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and his party won a third term but lost their majority in Parliament. The surprising rebuke gives strength to the voice of the opposition and the Indian public in a country that has drifted toward authoritarianism in recent years. The Opinion columnist Lydia Polgreen argues that this election result matters beyond India — and raises the importance of meeting voters where they are.

"Months after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada accused India’s government of plotting a murder on Canadian soil — plunging diplomatic relations between the two countries to their lowest level ever — the first arrests in the killing, which came on Friday, did little to demystify the basis of his claim. The police didn’t offer clues or present any evidence that India had orchestrated the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh nationalist leader who was gunned down at the temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia, in June. What they did say was that three Indian men had committed the killing and that an investigation into India’s role was ongoing. Before the arrests, Indian officials had maintained that Canada was trying to drag New Delhi into what it described as essentially a rivalry between gangs whose members were long wanted for crimes back in India. After the arrests, a report from the CBC, Canada’s public broadcasting corporation, based on anonymous sources, also said the suspects belonged to an Indian criminal gang. But analysts and former officials said that the possible role of a gang in the killing does not necessarily mean the Indian government was not involved in the crime. India’s external spy agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, or RAW, has long been suspected of tapping into criminal networks to carry out operations in its immediate neighborhood in South Asia while maintaining deniability. Canada’s accusation, if proven, that India orchestrated the Nijjar killing — and a similar accusation made soon after by the United States in a different case — may suggest that RAW is now extending its playbook of working with criminals to carry out operations in Western countries, analysts said. U.S. officials have produced strong evidence in their accusation that an agent of the Indian government participated in a foiled attempt to assassinate a dual American-Canadian citizen. And Canada and allied officials have maintained that Canada has evidence supporting Mr. Trudeau’s claim that Indian agents carried out Mr. Nijjar’s killing. But the Canadian failure to reveal any evidence that India took part, nine months after Mr. Trudeau’s explosive allegation, leaves the killing of Mr. Nijjar in the realm of accusations and counter-accusation in what is a highly tense political environment in both countries, analysts said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been flexing his muscles as a nationalist strongman, pitching himself during his ongoing campaign for a third-term in office as a protector of India who would go as far as it takes to target security threats. During speeches, he has boasted about how his government eliminates enemies by “descending in their homes.” While he has made those references in relation to the country’s archenemy — Pakistan — right wing accounts on social media had celebrated the slaying of Mr. Nijjar in Canada as a similar reach of Mr. Modi’s long arm. Mr. Trudeau, on the other hand, had been facing criticism of weakness in the face of Chinese election interference activities on Canadian soil, and his getting ahead of the Nijjar killing was seen as compensating for that. Canadian police announced on Friday that they had arrested the three Indian men in Edmonton, Alberta, the same day and charged them with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the killing of Mr. Nijjar. The suspects had been living in Canada for three to five years but were not permanent residents of Canada, the police said. The gang that the CBC reported that the hit-men are connected to is led by Lawrence Bishnoi, 31, who is accused of several cases of murder, extortion and narcotics trafficking. He has orchestrated much of it from an Indian jail, where he has been held since 2014. His members are seen as being behind the murder of a popular Punjabi rapper, and threats of attacks on Bollywood celebrities. Indian security officials have frequently arrested criminals connected to Mr. Bishnoi, often with allegations that the gang’s network stretched as far as Canada and overlapped with those promoting from Canadian soil the cause of Khalistan, a once deeply violent separatist movement with the goal of carving out the Indian state of Punjab as an independent nation. A large Sikh diaspora resides in Canada, many of them having migrated there after a violent and often indiscriminate crackdown by the Indian government in the 1980s against the movement for an independent Khalistan. While the cause has largely died down inside India, it continues to have supporters among some segments of the diaspora. The Indian government has accused Canada, and several other Western countries, of not doing enough to crack down on the separatists. Analysts and former security officials said that in India’s immediate geographic neighborhood, RAW has often been willing to venture into murky spaces to recruit killers. Senior officials of Mr. Modi’s administration, including Ajit Doval, the storied former spymaster who now serves as his longtime national security adviser, have in the past been accused of reaching into the underworld to find hit men willing to go after targets both inside the country as well as abroad. Mr. Bishnoi has demonstrated enormous power from behind bars, even giving a television interview from jail last year to pitch himself as a nationalist warrior rather than a criminal mastermind. That, one former security official said, was a signal of his trying to align himself with the spirit of nationalism for a potential deal. “I am a nationalist,” Mr. Bishnoi said in that interview. “I am against Khalistan. I am against Pakistan.” Ajai Sahni, a security analyst who runs the South Asia Terrorism Portal in New Delhi, said the exploitation of criminal gangs by spy agencies to carry out operations with deniability was something that “happens all over the world.” “It is definitely possible for agencies like RAW to use gang rivalries instead of exposing their own covert operators,” Mr. Sahni added. “But just because that is generally how one would expect it to be done, it doesn’t necessarily mean we know this is exactly the case in Nijjar’s killing.” The failed plot on American soil had some of the sloppy hallmarks of an agency trying to extend an old playbook into a different, unfamiliar space. A U.S. indictment in November laid out evidence, including electronic communication and cash transactions between the hired hit man — who turned out to be an undercover cop — a boastful middleman, and an Indian intelligence handler whom The Washington Post recently identified as Vikram Yadav. The Indian government’s response suggested worry: India’s top diplomat said the action was not government policy, while the government announced an investigation into the matter and promised cooperation with the United States. Canada’s case has played out very differently. The country has not publicly disclosed any evidence backing up Mr. Trudeau’s claim, even as allied officials said in September that Canadian officials had found a “smoking gun”: intercepted communications of Indian diplomats in Canada indicating involvement in the plot. Indian officials have pushed back against Mr. Trudeau’s claims with the kind of aggression that suggested it either wasn’t involved or that it was confident of its deniability. The Indian government expelled Canadian diplomats, and doubled down by putting out a list of individuals on Canadian soil that it said were long wanted as part of what it described as a crime and terror nexus. Last week, officials in Mr. Modi’s government jumped on scenes of an event that Mr. Trudeau had attended to say it showed his accusations were simply to appease what they say is a Sikh vote bank for him. They pointed to videos of an event where Mr. Trudeau was the chief guest and where chants of “long live Khalistan” were shouted. Mr. Trudeau, in his speech, said he will always be there “to protect your rights and your freedoms, and we will always defend your community against hatred.” After the speech, the Indian foreign ministry summoned Canada’s second highest ranking diplomat in New Delhi to lodge a complaint. “His remarks to us illustrates once again the kind of political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism and people who practice violence,” Randhir Jaiswal, the foreign ministry spokesman, said at a news conference.",negative
"A senior journalist with Australia’s national broadcaster says she was effectively pushed out of India after her reporting on Sikh separatism angered the Indian government, accusing the authorities of hindering her from going to events, seeking to have her reporting taken down and refusing for weeks to renew her visa. Avani Dias, the South Asia correspondent for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, said on social media that Indian officials told her last month that her application for a resident journalist visa extension would not be approved because a television segment she had produced on accusations that India was responsible for the killing of a Sikh activist in Canada had “crossed the line.” She was eventually granted a temporary visa extension at the last minute after lobbying by the Australian government, less than a day before she was scheduled to leave the country, Ms. Dias said in her podcast, “Looking for Modi.” But she said that she ultimately decided to leave because “it felt too difficult to do my job in India.” “I was struggling to get into public events run by Modi’s party,” Ms. Dias said on the podcast, which was about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Indian government has disputed Ms. Dias’ account and said she was assured by high ranking officials that her visa would be renewed. Her departure came amid a broader crackdown on free speech in the country and raids on journalists reporting on sensitive topics. During his 10 years leading the nation, Mr. Modi has consolidated power in India and across its institutions, challenging the founding principles of modern India, like secularism and freedom of the press. He is seeking a third term in parliamentary elections that begun this month. In March, Ms. Dias produced a television segment about the accusations made by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada last year that agents acting on behalf of the Indian government were behind the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist, on Canadian soil. The half-hour documentary examined the movement, which advocates for a separate Sikh state called Khalistan to be carved out of the Indian state of Punjab. During the half-hour documentary, which was broadcast in Australia and uploaded on social media, she detailed how permission for her and her crew to film at the border between Punjab and Pakistan had suddenly been revoked by Indian officials without explanation, and how she had been quizzed by Indian officials about her crew and the places she had visited to report on the story. “It’s clear that we’re being really monitored and that there’s concern about the story that we’re doing,” she said. On March 26, less than a week after the documentary was broadcast, the Indian government successfully sought to have YouTube block the video from showing in India. The next day, Ms. Dias was told by a representative of the Ministry of External Affairs that her application for a visa extension would not be renewed, according to a person directly familiar with the situation but who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the issue. Ms. Dias notified the Australian government, and Australian diplomats began to lobby for her visa, the person said. After weeks of bureaucratic back and forth, Ms. Dias received her visa extension on the evening of Apr. 18, the person said. But with her flight back to Australia departing the next day, and having already packed up her life in India, she made the decision to leave, Ms. Dias said in her podcast. She left on the first day of voting in India’s national election. A senior Indian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, refuted her account, saying Ms. Dias had been told well in advance that her visa would be extended. The official said that Ms. Dias had violated terms of her previous visa by attempting to film at the India-Pakistan border, which requires permission. Ms. Dias previously said she had sought and been granted that permission before it was revoked at the last minute. Ms. Dias had not been prevented from covering India’s election, but had her accreditation delayed because she had not yet received her visa extension, the Indian official said, adding that her colleagues at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation had been given accreditation to cover the elections. Ms. Dias’ departure adds to mounting concerns about press freedom in India, where Indian journalists have come under heavy pressure from the Modi administration. Foreign journalists in India are reporting more pressure, as well. In February, Vanessa Dougnac, a French freelance correspondent, said she had been forced to leave India, where she had lived for 25 years, after the authorities told her that they intended to withdraw her permanent residency permit. The authorities accused her of producing reporting that was “malicious and critical in manner,” and creating a “biased negative perception about India.” They said that she had worked as a journalist without holding a valid permit, after revoking her work permit in September 2022 without a clear reason.",negative
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his power at home secured and his Hindu-first vision deeply entrenched, has set his sights in recent years on a role as a global statesman, riding India’s economic and diplomatic rise. In doing so, he has distanced himself from his party’s staple work of polarizing India’s diverse population along religious lines for its own electoral gain. His silence provided tacit backing as vigilante groups continued to target non-Hindu minority groups and as members of his party routinely used hateful and racist language, even in Parliament, against the largest of those groups, India’s 200 million Muslims. With the pot kept boiling, Mr. Modi’s subtle dog whistles — with references to Muslim dress or burial places — could go a long way domestically while providing enough deniability to ensure that red carpets remained rolled out abroad for the man leading the world’s largest democracy. Just what drove the prime minister to break with this calculated pattern in a fiery campaign speech on Sunday — when he referred to Muslims by name as “infiltrators” with “more children” who would get India’s wealth if his opponents took power — has been hotly debated. It could be a sign of anxiety that his standing with voters is not as firm as believed, analysts said. Or it could be just a reflexive expression of the kind of divisive religious ideology that has fueled his politics from the start. But the brazenness made clear that Mr. Modi sees few checks on his enormous power. At home, watchdog institutions have been largely bent to the will of his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. Abroad, partners increasingly turn a blind eye to what Mr. Modi is doing in India as they embrace the country as a democratic counterweight to China. “Modi is one of the world’s most skilled and experienced politicians,” said Daniel Markey, a senior adviser in the South Asia program at the United States Institute of Peace. “He would not have made these comments unless he believed he could get away with it.” Mr. Modi may have been trying to demonstrate this impunity, Mr. Markey said, “to intimidate the B.J.P.’s political opponents and to show them — and their supporters — just how little they can do in response.” The prime minister sees himself as the builder of a new, modern India on the march toward development and international respect. But he also wants to leave a legacy that is distinctly different from that of the leaders who founded the country as a secular republic after British colonial rule. Before joining its political offshoot, he spent more than a decade as a cultural foot soldier of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., a right-wing organization founded in 1925 with the mission of making India a Hindu state. The group viewed it as treason when an independent India agreed to a partition that created Pakistan as a separate nation for Muslims, embraced secularism and gave all citizens equal rights. A onetime member went so far as to assassinate Mohandas K. Gandhi in outrage. Over his decade in national power, Mr. Modi has been deeply effective in advancing some of the central items of the Hindu-right agenda. He abolished the semi-autonomy of the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir. He enacted a citizenship law widely viewed as prejudiced against Muslims. And he helped see through the construction of a grand temple to the Hindu deity Ram on a plot long disputed between Hindus and Muslims. The violent razing in 1992 of the mosque that had stood on that land — which Hindu groups said was built on the plot of a previous temple — was central to the national movement of Hindu assertiveness that ultimately swept Mr. Modi to power more than two decades later. More profoundly, Mr. Modi has shown that the broader goals of a Hindu state can largely be achieved within the bounds of India’s constitution — by co-opting the institutions meant to protect equality. Officials in his party have a ready rebuttal to any complaint along these lines. How could Mr. Modi discriminate against anyone, they say, if all Indian citizens benefit equally from his government’s robust welfare offerings — of toilets, of roofs over heads, of monthly rations? That argument, analysts say, is telling in showing how Mr. Modi has redefined democratic power not as leadership within checks and balances, but as the broad generosity of a strongman, even as he has redefined citizenship in practice to make clear there is a second class. Secularism — the idea that no religion will be favored over any other — has largely been co-opted to mean that no religion will be allowed to deny Hindus their dominance as the country’s majority, his critics say. Officials under Mr. Modi, who wear their religion on their sleeves and publicly mix prayer with politics, crack down on public expressions of other religions as breaching India’s secularism. While right-wing officials promote conversion to Hinduism, which they describe as a “return home,” they have introduced laws within many of the states they govern that criminalize conversion from Hinduism. Egged on by such leaders, Hindu extremists have lynched Muslim men accused of transporting cows or beef and hounded them over charges of “love jihad” — or luring Hindu women. Vigilantes have frequently barged into churches and accosted priests they believe have engaged in proselytizing or conversion. “What they have done is to create a permissive environment which encourages hate and valorizes hate,” said Harsh Mander, a former civil servant who is now a campaigner for social harmony. In reference to Mr. Modi’s speech on Sunday, he added: “This open resort to this kind of hate speech will only encourage that hard-line Hindu right in society.” Tom Vadakkan, a spokesman for the B.J.P., said the prime minister’s comments on Muslims had been misinterpreted. Mr. Modi, Mr. Vadakkan said, was referring to “intruders” or “illegal migrants” who the party claims are being used by the political opposition to “redefine the demography.” Privately, Western diplomats in New Delhi do little to hide their discomfort with some of Mr. Modi actions as a democratic ally, from the targeting of minorities to his crackdowns on opposition and dissent. But they acknowledge that he is exploiting a particularly open season in the global order, with many of their own capitals providing a less positive example than they once did, and with so much focus on China and trade deals. Mr. Markey, the Washington-based analyst, said the U.S. government was holding back from voicing concerns publicly for several reasons beyond its national interest in having India serve as an economic and geopolitical counterweight to China. The United States, he said, realizes the growing limits of its public criticism in changing partner nations’ behavior. That was demonstrated most recently by the repeated instances in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel ignored President Biden’s demands that the Israeli military change its conduct within the war in Gaza. Criticism of Mr. Modi, Mr. Markey added, could also backfire for U.S. politicians who “do not want to get crosswise with Indian diaspora groups.” But Mr. Modi may not remain immune as he pursues closer partnerships with the United States in areas like joint weapons manufacturing, transfer of high technology and sharing of intelligence. “My sense is that Washington’s increasing discomfort with Modi’s domestic politics is gradually lowering the ceiling of potential U.S. cooperation with India,” Mr. Markey said. “The question is just how far Washington is willing to trust India. Will India be treated as an ally in everything but name, or as a partner more like Vietnam or Saudi Arabia?”",negative
"Hundreds of millions of people in South and Southeast Asia were suffering on Monday from a punishing heat wave that has forced schools to close, disrupted agriculture, and raised the risk of heat strokes and other health complications. The weather across the region in April is generally hot, and comes before Asia’s annual summer monsoon, which dumps rain on parched soil. But this April’s temperatures have so far been unusually high. In Bangladesh, where schools and universities are closed this week, temperatures in some areas have soared above 107 degrees Fahrenheit, or 42 degrees Celsius. Those numbers don’t quite capture how extreme humidity makes the heat feel even worse. “Due to increasing moisture incursion, the discomfort may increase” over the next 72 hours, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department said in a notice on Monday. In Dhaka, the capital, the humidity was 73 percent, and many areas in the country have experienced daily power outages. The heat wave could lead to more cases of certain diseases, including cholera and diarrhea, said Be-Nazir Ahmed, a public health expert in Bangladesh and a former director of the national Directorate General of Health Services. Mr. Ahmed said that people should ideally try to work earlier in the morning and later at night, when temperatures are lower. But that is easier said than done in a country where many people work outdoors. Nur-e-Alam, who pulls a rickshaw by hand in Dhaka’s Mogbazar area, said he had scaled back to five to seven hours a day, down from eight to 10, because of the heat. His earnings have taken a hit. He expected to make 500 to 600 takas, or about $5, on Monday, about half his usual wage. “I haven’t experienced heat like this before,” Mr. Alam said. “Every year gets hotter, but this year is extreme.” The heat wave poses similar challenges in neighboring India, where extreme temperatures have strained power grids, forced school closures, and threatened the production of wheat and other crops. Temperatures in some areas did not dip below 108 degrees Fahrenheit last weekend. The national meteorological department said on Sunday that it expected heat wave conditions in some states for another five days. The heat has collided with the start of India’s six-week general election, in which nearly a billion people are eligible to vote. The election authorities are working to provide water on voting days, and some political parties are bringing water and cooling devices to campaign rallies. Extreme heat also has a political dimension in Myanmar, where the ruling military junta cited soaring temperatures last week as justification for moving Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the country’s ousted civilian leader, from prison to an undisclosed location. Many people in Myanmar believe that generals are moving her for other reasons but using the heat — the capital recently hit 114.8 degrees Fahrenheit — as a pretext. Asia’s heat wave isn’t happening in a meteorological vacuum. Last year was Earth’s warmest by far in a century and a half. And the region is in the middle of an El Niño cycle, a climate phenomenon that tends to create warm, dry conditions in Asia. Asia’s summer monsoon will bring relief, but it’s still weeks away. In Thailand on Monday, the national forecast called for “hot to very hot weather.” It put the chances of rain in Bangkok, the capital, at zero percent.",neutral
"The Group of 7 countries threw open the doors of their club on Friday to India, Brazil, Turkey and other non-Western countries, acknowledging a shifting global landscape as they tried to enlist these nations’ leaders in causes ranging from climate change to managing the economic competition with China. While diplomats from the Group of 7 hammered out a communiqué that pledged support for Ukraine in its war against Russia and greater ambition in curbing carbon emissions, the focus was on Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and other leaders from outside the G7, whose support is increasingly critical to achieving any of these goals. Among the thorny questions on the second day of the summit: migration, which has helped fuel a recent resurgence of populism and far-right parties in Europe and the United States. The leaders also discussed the war in Gaza and China’s state subsidies of industries like electric vehicles, which has prompted the United States and the European Union to impose tariffs on Chinese exports. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, who is hosting the gathering, said the goal of her expanded guest list was to “strengthen dialogue with the nations of the Global South.” She insisted that the Group of 7 was “not a fortress closed in itself” but “an offer of values that we open to the world.” Ms. Meloni recruited Pope Francis to speak to the leaders about the dangers posed by artificial intelligence. Francis urged them to regulate the technology, of which he was himself a victim when A.I.-generated fake images of him clad in a white puffer jacket and a jewel-encrusted crucifix went viral last year. “The benefits and the damages it causes will depend on the way it is used,” the pope declared, warning of the risks of A.I.’s uncontrolled development. He called for lethal autonomous weapons, which are unmanned and uncontrolled by a human hand, to be banned, saying, “No machine should ever decide whether to take the life of a human being away.” The pope’s appearance was the emotional highlight of a day of carefully staged summitry that seemed to concede that the West is less dominant demographically and economically than in the past — and that it is listening to calls for more equity and balance in global decision-making. As Ms. Meloni guided the pope, in a wheelchair, around a circular table to meet the leaders, he was greeted by a visibly moved President Biden and got an enthusiastic hug from Argentina’s flamboyant president, Javier Milei, whose election last November was viewed as another sign of the rising tide of populism across the Americas and Europe. This is not the first time non-Western leaders have been invited to a Group of 7 meeting, but rarely have they been so conspicuous. In part that reflects the issues that Ms. Meloni has highlighted: Africa and the Mediterranean. The leaders of Algeria, Kenya and Tunisia were on hand at a luxury resort hotel on Italy’s southern coast, as was President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. “Inviting key developing country leaders reflects the reality that confronting China and Russia requires the cooperation of more than the G7,” said Daniel M. Price, who was a top trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “And Brazil, India and Turkey are as concerned about Chinese predatory trade practices and overcapacity as are Japan, Europe and the U.S.” The final G7 communiqué voiced concern about what the leaders called China’s “persistent industrial targeting and comprehensive nonmarket policies and practices that are leading to global spillovers, market distortions and harmful overcapacity.” The communiqué endorsed Mr. Biden’s effort to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. France and Canada had pushed for stronger language on Israel’s conduct of the war, according to people familiar with the negotiations, but the United States and Germany resisted. In a victory for Ms. Meloni, a conservative who opposes abortion, the communiqué did not include an explicit reference to abortion, in a passage that pledged to promote “comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.” A communiqué released by the Group of 7 leaders after their last summit in Hiroshima, Japan, referred specifically to abortion rights. The issue injected a briefly discordant note into the gathering after President Emmanuel Macron of France told an Italian journalist that some politicians did not share France’s “vision of equality between women and men.” Ms. Meloni criticized Mr. Macron, who recently called a snap parliamentary election, as seeking to politicize the issue at a “precious forum like the G7.” For the most part, however, the meeting underscored harmony among the leaders, many of whom are embattled by their own domestic politics. It also served as a platform for Ms. Meloni, 47, who has overcome initial qualms about her political roots in a party built on the ashes of fascism to win respect for her steadfast support of Ukraine. Presiding over the two days of meetings, she was able to put a spotlight on several of her pet issues. How to control migration has vexed the United States and Europe, compounded by the effects of climate change and warfare in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Ukraine. It is a particularly delicate issue for Ms. Meloni, who has campaigned hard to fight what she has called “uncontrolled immigration” to Italy and other parts of Europe from Africa and the Middle East. While Europe has welcomed thousands of Ukrainians, especially women and children, fleeing the Russian invasion, Ukrainian officials have urged European countries to help them repatriate men of fighting age. “Turkey is a critical player on global migration,” said Peter Westmacott, who served as Britain’s ambassador to Turkey, France and the United States. He noted that there are about three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds and Afghans. “If Europe wants to control migration from these countries,” Mr. Westmacott said, “Turkey is an indispensable partner.” Mr. Erdogan, he said, could also yet play a role in brokering an end to Ukraine’s war with Russia. As a Black Sea power, Turkey has kept open its commercial and political links to Russia. But it is also a NATO member and has supplied cheap, highly effective drones to help the Ukrainian resistance. Some of the invitations reflected diplomatic protocol, according to Italian officials. Brazil, India and South Africa were automatically included as current or future presidents of the Group of 20 industrialized nations. Argentina was invited, these officials said, because Mr. Milei has recognized the connections and interdependence between East and West. He and Ms. Meloni have also cultivated close personal ties, sharing a right-wing populism that includes opposition to abortion and gay rights.",positive
"India might not be the first country that springs to mind when someone mentions video games, but it's one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. Analysts believe there could be more than half a billion players there by the end of this year. Most of them are playing on mobile phones and tablets, and fans will tell you the industry is mostly known for fantasy sports games that let you assemble imaginary teams based on real players. Despite concerns over gambling and possible addiction, they're big business. The country's three largest video game startups - Game 24X7, Dream11 and Mobile Premier League – all provide some kind of fantasy sport experience and are valued at over $1bn. But there's hope that a crop of story-driven games making a splash worldwide could inspire a new wave of creativity and investment. During the recent Summer Game Fest (SGF) - an annual showcase of new and upcoming titles held in Los Angeles and watched by millions - audiences saw previews of a number of story-rich titles from South Asian teams. One of those was Detective Dotson by Masala Games, based in Gujarat, about a failed Bollywood actor turned detective. Industry veteran Shalin Shodhan is behind the game and tells BBC Asian Network this focus on unique stories is “bucking the trend” in India's games industry. He wants video games to become an “interactive cultural export” but says he's found creating new intellectual property difficult. “There really isn’t anything in the marketplace to make stories about India,"" he says, despite the strength of some of the country's other cultural industries. “If you think about how much intellectual property there is in film in India, it is really surprising to think nothing indigenous exists as an original entertainment property in games,"" he says. ""It’s almost like the Indian audience accepted that we’re just going to play games from outside.” Another game shown during SGF was The Palace on the Hill – a ""slice-of-life"" farming sim set in rural India. Mala Sen, from developer Niku Games, says games like this and Detective Dotson are what “India needed”. “We know that there are a lot of people in India who want games where characters and setting are relatable to them,"" she says. Games developed by South Asian teams based in western countries have been finding critical praise and commercial success in recent years. Venba, a cooking sim that told the story of a migrant family reconnecting with their heritage through food, became the first game of its kind to take home a Bafta Game Award this year. Canada-based Visai Games, which developed the title, was revealed during SGF as one of the first beneficiaries of a new fund set up by Among Us developer Innersloth to boost fellow indie developers. That will go towards their new, unnamed project based on ancient Tamil legends. Another title awarded funding by the scheme was Project Dosa, from developer Outerloop, that sees players pilot giant robots, cook Indian food and fight lawyers. Its previous game, Thirsty Suitors, was also highly praised and nominated for a Bafta award this year. Games such as these resonating with players worldwide helps perceptions from the wider industry, says Mumbai-based Indrani Ganguly, of Duronto Games. “Finally, people are starting to see we’re not just a place for outsource work,” she says. “We’re moving from India being a technical space to more of a creative hub. “I’m not 100% seeing a shift but that’s more of a mindset thing. ""People who are able to make these kinds of games have always existed but now there is funding and resource opportunities available to be able to act on these creative visions.” British-Indian game developer Charu Desodt believes the success of titles such as Venba has been thanks to their commitment to authenticity. “They make me feel very proud,"" she says. ""We’re coming to a point where the industry is growing massively, both in terms of hours spent gaming but more importantly in the variety of the games. ""When you have authentic local stories told from the heart, that’s something everyone can relate to.” Charu says funding for ""unique and quirky stories has been an issue"" but recent successes such as Venba and Thirsty Suitors have shown there is an appetite for south Asian stories told by south Asian developers. Some of the industry's biggest companies are also paying attention. Last year, Sony launched its India Hero Project with a goal to “unearth and empower India’s brightest game development talents” via mentorship and funding. Its first cohort of games included slice-of-life games Fishbowl, museum exploration game Mukti and rhythm-action game Suri: the Seventh Note, inspired by mythical Indian stories from the Himalayas to Rajasthan. Meanwhile french publishing giant Ubisoft’s Indie Series has supported Thousand Star Studios in creating Aikyam – a Bollywood-inspired fantasy roleplaying game set to be released this year. Charu says video games and their interactivity allow people to “understand a concept on a very deep level."" “It’s not just about me appreciating my south Asian roots but its about other people really connecting with the authenticity of that experience,” says Charu. “It takes time for an industry to evolve and mature,"" she says. ""We’re in the early days as an industry as a whole, even in the west. ""But people now have access to technology and India is also a nation that loves to tell stories.” Listen to Ankur Desai's show on BBC Asian Network live from 15:00-18:00 Monday to Thursday - or listen back here.

"Madhu Bai says she is like a rainbow. She rose from a storm, fleetingly spread joy and then returned to the sky. The 44-year-old made history in 2015 when she became the first trans person to be elected a mayor in India. She won in Raigarh, a small town in the central state of Chhattisgarh. But when her term ended in 2020, Madhu returned to her old life without a pension or government benefits. She dances and sings with other hijras, or trans women, at weddings and birth ceremonies - a common livelihood in India's transgender community. Madhu has no intention of re-joining politics. She says she is tired and thinks it's too polarised. ""I fought, won and worked for the people. Now I want to live for myself."" Madhu's short but successful political foray in India is a rarity in a field where the LGBTQ community is still heavily underrepresented. It's perplexing, activists say, in a democracy where acceptance of sexual and gender diversity has been on the rise and the community has seen many wins. In 2014, the Supreme Court officially recognised transgender people and their rights to welfare and other government benefits. Four years later, it scrapped a colonial-era ban on gay sex. Over half of Indian adults now believe same-sex marriage should be legal, according to a Pew survey. But LGBTQ Indians cannot only rely on the courts for change, as a ruling from the top court to not legalise same-sex unions demonstrated last year. Judges declared that changing the law was a matter for politicians, not the justice system. Campaigners say that LGBTQ politicians are the best advocates for their community. Yet in this year's general election, no major political party has fielded a single openly LGBTQ candidate. ""Queer people have been left out of conversations, told politics is not an avenue for them for so long,"" says Anish Gawande, a writer and founder of Pink List India, the country's first archive of politicians supporting LGBTQ+ rights. ""They never got the chance to build the necessary structures to advocate their demands."" No-one knows this better than Madhu. She says overcoming the ridicule and contempt of her opponents was more challenging than wooing voters, who connected with her instantly. After going door-to-door with her friends for days, asking for money to fund the campaign, she struggled to get a party ticket. Indian elections are expensive, and contesting independently without political funding is costlier. But she had no option after the two main political parties rejected her. When she won, she thought leaders would take her seriously. They didn't. At her first meeting, she says, members of several parties walked out. She alleges that a local leader threatened to slap her because he found her dance videos offensive. There were also days, in the beginning, when Madhu said she felt unsure whether she could use the women's washroom around party workers. ""People loved me and my work, but rivals hated my guts,"" she says. ""Behind the ridicule and abuse, I know they were all thinking the same thing: 'How could a hijra be the mayor?'"" The only official data on India's LGBTQ population is the government estimate: 2.5 million. But survey estimates suggest the true figure could be over 135 million. Campaigners say things have changed since Madhu won her seat. Today, more Indians know someone who is LGBTQ than they did a few years ago. Even some politicians, who were once wary of the subject, are becoming allies and promising more rights. ""Political parties in India are slowly peeping out of the closet and talking more prominently about LGBTQ rights,"" says Harish Iyer, one of India's first openly gay persons to be involved with a political party. There's also a growing momentum among the youth, who, Mr Iyer says, want to ""do away with homophobia once and for all"". This year's election campaign comes months after the Supreme Court decided to not legalise same-sex unions. Three opposition parties have promised to recognise same-sex couples legally, but the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - which polls suggest is likely to win a historic third term - has not. Despite this, Mr Gawande insists that LGBTQ rights are a current that Indian politics can no longer dismiss. The community's social and cultural capital is ""far in excess of its numerical strength"", he says. He expects the near future to bring wins on recognising relationships, affirmative action for trans people and access to healthcare. Some of these fights might not grab headlines - especially those affecting poorer people, who are at the sharp end of exclusion from jobs, education and political opportunities. ""LGBTQ struggles need to be seen through the lens of caste privilege,"" says Grace Banu, a Dalit (formerly untouchable) trans woman activist from the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Born in a poor family, she says she first faced discrimination because of her caste, and then over her gender. When she came out at the age of 14, her school barred her from taking classes and made her sit under a tree as punishment. When she resisted, her parents put her in a psychiatric hospital to ""cure her illness"". ""I would tell myself that this cannot be my destiny,"" she says. ""One day, I ran away to make my own fate."" Today, Ms Banu is a software engineer, the first trans woman with an engineering degree in her state, and considers herself a mother to 12 trans women. She lives in Chennai with a clan of three trans women, all of whom are also involved in the anti-caste and trans rights movement. Sprawled in the living room, they talk passionately about their lives, the conversations swerving across topics. One moment they are discussing their next court battle and the next minute they are wondering what to eat for lunch. ""The transgender, or the LGBTQ identity, is not a monolith,"" says Ms Banu, while her friends busy themselves in the kitchen, the clatter of plates occasionally interrupting the afternoon stillness. The 44-year-old recently petitioned an Indian court seeking ""horizontal reservations"", or separate quotas for transgender people in government jobs, within the existing quotas for historically disadvantaged communities. Ms Banu stresses that being transgender varies vastly across caste and class lines. Her fight, she says, focuses on the most marginalised. At the other end of Chennai, in an upscale apartment along the sea, lives Apsara Reddy, a trans woman and spokesperson of AIADMK, one of Tamil Nadu's main political parties. A former journalist with degrees from Australia and the UK, Ms Reddy's is a life of luxury: she drives a shiny silver Jaguar, collects art and wears the finest of silk saris. Ms Reddy acknowledges her privilege, but says: ""In politics, you need to look at the larger picture. You can't just be the voice of your own community."" Ms Reddy hasn't contested in an election but if she does, she doesn't want to be typecast ""as an LGBTQ flagbearer"" of her party. ""If you want to judge me, do it on the basis of my potential as a policy-maker, not my gender identity."" Activists say few in the LGBTQ community are able to come out like Ms Reddy, let alone conceive a life in politics. Mr Gawande suggests that for a long time, the community was never a political priority. The battle for equality taking place in the courts made it difficult for them to build relationships with other marginalised communities under a broader fight for equality, he says. Now he wants the community to focus on grassroots political activism, which he believes will raise the profile of LGBTQ issues. Mr Iyer, however, believes the ball is now in the court of the country's leaders. ""We are your friends, your family, customers, beneficiaries; we are everywhere but you haven't looked for us. If you call us, we will come to you, and that's what we expect from political parties."" Back in Raigarh, Madhu says it gets hard to get by sometimes, without a fixed pay. But given the life she's had, she's not constrained by what may lie ahead. ""Whatever it is, it's definitely not politics,"" she says, her jaunty sing-song voice soaring into a laugh. But she hopes others from the community seek political opportunities, so that queer people are no longer seen as oddities. ""Who knows, maybe then the country will see a rainbow again.""

"Indian filmmaker Payal Kapadia’s new film opens with street scenes of contemporary Mumbai. But All We Imagine as Light does not show us the rich, elite Mumbai of Bollywood stars and billionaire industrialists. Instead the filmmaker overlays the street images with voices of real immigrants of Mumbai who are the city’s heartbeat. This is Kapadia’s first narrative feature and it premiered on Thursday night in the main competition section of the Cannes Film Festival. The film received an eight-minute-long standing ovation. It's a significant achievement for the filmmaker, and also for India. This is the first time in 30 years that an Indian film has played in Cannes’ main competition section. Kapadia, 38, shares the limelight and the possibility of winning one of the festival’s prestigious awards with the likes of Francis Ford Coppola, Yorgos Lanthimos, Ali Abbasi, Jacques Audiard, and Jia Zhangke. Over the last four decades, Indian films have done fairly well on the world festival circuit. Mira Nair’s Salaam Bombay won the Camera d’Or at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival. A few days before the September 11 terrorist attacks, Nair’s 2001 classic Monsoon Wedding won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Director Ritesh Batra’s 2013 celebrated film The Lunchbox won the Grand Golden Rail Award at Cannes. And earlier this year director Shuchi Talati’s Girls Will Be Girls was awarded the Grand Jury and Audience prizes at the Sundance Film Festival. But the possibility of Palm d’Or or one of the other key Cannes awards has so far eluded India – the biggest film producing country in the world. This year, thanks to Kapadia’s beautifully realised and moving film, India stands a good chance of winning. Already the reviews have been full of high praise. The Guardian in its five-star review describes it as ""glorious… an absorbing story full of humanity"". The critic puts the film on a par with Satyajit Ray’s Mahanagar (The Big City) and Aranyer Din Ratri (Days and Nights in the Forest). And IndieWire in its A-grade review says Kapadia’s drama gives Mumbai a romantic gaze, as reflected in the way ""people occupy their space… whether alone or sharing"". Daughter of a well-known Indian artist Nalini Malani, Kapadia is very familiar with Mumbai, a multicultural and diverse city. ""It’s also a place where it’s a little bit easier for women to work as compared to many other places in the country,"" Kapadia says. ""I wanted to make a film about women who leave their homes to go to work somewhere else."" In All We Know as Light, Kapadia tracks the lives and struggles of two Indian nurses from the southern state of Kerala working in a hospital and living together in a small, congested apartment in Mumbai. One nurse – Prabha (Kani Kusruti, who played a supporting role in Girls Will Be Girls) - is married. Her husband now works in Germany and barely ever communicates with her. But then she suddenly receives a surprise gift from her husband – a rice cooker. She hugs the machine, as if it is the last sign of love in her marriage. The second nurse, Anu (Divya Prabha), is more adventurous and is carrying a secret romance with a young Muslim man Shiaz (a charming young actor, Hridhu Haroon) who is also from Kerala. Anu is Hindu and her family would not approve of her relationship with Shiaz. Mumbai’s congested environment with 22 million people clamouring for space and its harsh monsoon season does not allow Anu and Shiaz any privacy. But then suddenly a third nurse from their hospital – Parvaty (Chhaya Kadam, appearing in two films at Cannes this year) - decides to leave the city, forced out by the redevelopment of a slum for the city's rich. Could this be the chance to change the course of these characters' lives? The politics of negotiating space is no different than the struggles of students Kapadia captured in her last film – a documentary titled A Night of Knowing Nothing. The film premiered in the Directors’ Fortnight sidebar section of the Cannes festival in 2022. It won the L'Œil d'or ""Golden Eye"", the festival’s top documentary award. A Night of Knowing Nothing followed the 2015 students’ strike at the country’s prestigious government-run Film and Television Institute of India. Kapadia was part of the strike, and finally graduated from the institute with a degree in direction in 2018. In an interview in 2022 she described the documentary as a ""love letter to public universities and what they stand for – a place where ideally people of all strata of society can be together and enjoy freedom, both intellectual and physical"". A similar sentiment echoes in All We Imagine as Light. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"Tech giant Google will soon begin making its Pixel smartphones in India, sources aware of the development have told the BBC. Google is set to manufacture the phones at an existing Foxconn facility in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The firm is also set to independently manufacture drones in the state. India has emerged as a key destination for global firms looking to diversify supply lines outside China in the midst of geopolitical tensions with the West. Last year, Google had announced plans to make Pixel smartphones in India, beginning with the Pixel 8. ""India is a priority market for Pixel smartphones, and we’re committed to bringing the best of our hardware and underlying built-in software capabilities to people across the country,"" it said in a blog post. On Friday, sources told the BBC that Alphabet's Google would make advanced versions of Pixel smartphones at the Tamil Nadu facility and that manufacturing would begin within this calendar year. Google and Foxconn have signed a contract to this end, the source said. Foxconn currently has two facilities in Tamil Nadu. At one of its facilities near Chennai city, it assembles Apple's iPhones. Google's decision to make Pixel phones in Tamil Nadu came after state officials met company executives recently. According to a statement from the Tamil Nadu government, officials from Google are also set to meet state Chief Minister MK Stalin in Chennai soon. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"In 2015, Saurabh Netravalkar gave up his dreams of playing professional cricket in India and moved to the US to work as a software engineer. “Cricket was over for me. I had no hope or expectation left to play again,” he says. On Wednesday, almost a decade later, he will face the Indian cricket team in a T20 World Cup match at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, New York. But he will do so as part of the US team. As he embarks on his World Cup dream, Netravalkar says the match will be an ""emotional moment"" for a cricketer who once played for India’s Under-19 team. “Many of my former team-mates are now playing for India,” he tells the BBC. But he is unfazed about the prospect of facing his friends in a crucial match. He is full of confidence and it showed in his impeccable bowling last week in a super over that led the US to a historic win against Pakistan. Netravalkar’s is a story of persistence, a love for cricket and, also, the American dream. Born and raised in Mumbai, Netravalkar began playing cricket when he was just 10. His family lived in Malad, a suburb in the western part of the city. After some remarkable performances as a teenager, he was picked to represent India in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand. The tall, left-arm fast bowler emerged as the leading wicket-taker of the tournament for the Indian team. Over the next few years, Netravalkar balanced his pursuit of cricket while studying to become an engineer, graduating in 2013. After that, the bowler says he decided to concentrate on cricket, giving himself two years. During this time, he attempted to get a spot in the national team as well as the Mumbai cricket team. “I got into the [Mumbai] squad too. But I couldn’t cement my place or even get into the Indian Premier League (IPL),” he says. A cricketer’s career usually starts at 23. But Netravalkar says he decided to leave the sport at that point. “I was in two minds. Should I pursue cricket or concentrate on studies?” he says. In 2015, he started studying in Cornell University in the US for a degree in computer science. “It was a difficult decision,” he says. But he could never fully let go of his cricket dreams. During his time as an engineering student in India, he’d already developed CricDeCode, an app to help cricketers analyse their game. At Cornell, Netravalkar saw students play cricket and joined a club to participate in inter-college tournaments. Soon after graduating, Netravalkar got a job with software giant Oracle and moved to California. In San Francisco, Netravalkar began playing club cricket. “They had weekend tournaments. I would work for five days and play on Saturday and Sunday.” It was far from professional cricket, but it was still a chance to play the game. “San Francisco still doesn’t have proper pitches. They play on an artificial pitch that’s more like a synthetic mat,” he says. “But they had soil pitches in a park in Los Angeles - it’s like the Maidan [a famous park] in Mumbai.” Every Friday evening, he would drive for six hours to Los Angeles to play a match on Saturday. Then he’d drive back to play a match in San Francisco on Sunday. “In the club [in Los Angeles], there were three to four players who were part of the American team,” he says. “It was then I got to know that America had a cricket team.” “On long weekends, they organised tournaments in the country, mostly in Florida, where even players from the West Indies would participate.” Those tournaments provided a good platform, but Netravalkar was still not dreaming of playing for the US national team. “I was on a student visa and then a work visa. So there was no question of playing for the team.” The International Cricket Council (ICC), which governs the sport across the world, also had a rule that required Netravalkar to have lived in the US for seven years and be a permanent resident. But the rule changed in 2018 and Netravalkar was picked for the US cricket team. In 2019, the ICC also gave international T20 status to all its associate members, including the US. “Many think it’s easier to play for obscure teams that are considered underdogs,” he says. “But the struggle is even harder here. Playing for associate countries is difficult because they lack basic infrastructure,” he explains. All players in the US team also have full-time jobs and juggle family responsibilities. ""So we practise indoors from 7-9pm.” In a country like the US, distance adds to the struggle of bringing players from different corners to play together. So the team usually meets 10 days before a tournament to practice. The US overcame these odds to progress from the upper divisions of associate cricket to playing the T20 World Cup this year. They have already qualified for the 2026 World Cup. “The standard of local cricket here has gone up,” Netravalkar says. “Major league and minor league made a huge difference because they gave us a chance to play with top players. There are better grounds being made and pitches are improving.” Cricket academies in the country are also nurturing new players. Even as fan following for the sport grows in places like California, Netravalkar says US cricket faces a tough road ahead. “There’s only one tournament in a year where you play five matches in seven days. So all our efforts throughout the year are tested in just those five days.” “If you win, then you can go ahead. Or else there’s nothing.” Before this T20 World Cup, the US beat Bangladesh in a series which boosted their confidence. Then, in the first game of this tournament, they defeated Canada before going on to upset Pakistan. Netravalkar is now preparing to face his old team-mates from India in the match on Wednesday. “It is nice to reconnect with them and I’m happy for what they have achieved - for India and in the IPL,” he says. Despite facing a star-studded team, Netravalkar is optimistic about his team’s chances. “They [India] practise for hours and we had very limited resources. But anything can happen in T20,” he says. “We are positive. We will give our best in those three hours.” Copyright 2024 BBC.
